THORChain is a network that facilitates native asset settlement between
Bitcoin
,
Ethereum
,
BNB Chain
,
Avalanche
,
Cosmos Hub
,
Dogecoin
,
Bitcoin Cash
&

THORChain is secured by its native token, RUNE, which deterministically accrues value as
more assets are deposited into the network.
Anyone can use THORChain to swap native assets between any supported chains or deposit
their assets to earn yield from swaps.

FEATURES
Native Asset Security
Swap assets without relying on wrapped tokens.
Provide liquidity and maintain custody.
Native Assets
THORChain allows native cross-chain swaps without wrapped or pegged assets. Users donât
need RUNE to pay for transactions. The only requirement is a transaction on the first chain.
Non-Custodial
Swappers always maintain self-custody of their funds, so they are always in control,
including directly from a hardware wallet. Liquidity providers funds are always solvent,
visible, and verifiable on the blockchain - secured by the open source code.
Single Asset Liquidity
Savers Vaults allow anyone to provide liquidity to THORChain and earn from swap fees without exposure to RUNE.

Secured by RUNE
Node operators bond RUNE to enter the network. Their bonds are worth more than the assets
they secure. THORChainâs open source code keeps funds safe.
UPCOMING
Chain Agnostic Service Provider
THORChainâs strong foundation for cross-chain communication enables much more than swaps.
New features and primitives undergo extensive research, design, and debate by the community and are subject to THORChain's node governance processes. New blockchains are connected periodically.
