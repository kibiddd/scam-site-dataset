GetBlock’s user-friendly interface simplifies the endpoint setup process. Enjoy full interaction with the blockchain without the hassle of maintaining a full node — let the RPC Node provider handle the complexity for you.Learn moreFAQFrequently Asked QuestionsWhat are blockchain nodes?Blockchain nodes are remote computers connected and synchronized to maintain the integrity of blockchain networks. Technically, they are high-end hardware devices with specific software that are connected to each other. Distributed ledgers rely on them while adding new data to the chain, confirming transactions and preserving the history of accounts and blocks.How to browse crypto nodes list?In crypto nodes list by GetBlock, we demonstrate all endpoints (URLs) available for integrating into decentralized applications of various types. To find the one you need, you should know the name of the network (Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC), type of the network (testnet, mainnet), and type of API interface (JSON RPC, WebSockets or WS, and so on).How to find the perfect RPC API in blockchain nodes list?Various blockchains are designed to cater various use-cases. For instance, non-programmable networks like Bitcoin or Litecoin don’t support smart contracts natively. As such, developers can’t deploy mainstream dApps to these blockchains. However, non-programmable protocols can be useful for wallets, trading bots, centralized exchanges, and so on.How to start working with blockchain RPCs by GetBlock?In order to start using GetBlock, you need to register an account (either e-mail, Google account or MetaMask wallet is needed), validate it, choose the RPC APIs from the crypto nodes list, and start sending requests. To start using paid packages, users should top up the account with fiat or crypto.What are dedicated APIs in crypto?In crypto development there are two types of private RPC API endpoints: shared and dedicated ones. Dedicated endpoints should be referred to as devices used to support the operations of a single application: one device serves one client.More questions? ContactWhat is a Node in Crypto?Essential components in any blockchain network, nodes serve as the underlying infrastructure for managing blockchain operations and transactions involving crypto and other digital assets.They can have various functions depending on the type of blockchain and the specific role they are assigned: full, archive, light, validator, or RPC node.Ultimately, nodes are solely responsible for the functionality, security, and existence of blockchain networks, making them foundational to all blockchain-based activities, from simple transactions to complex decentralized applications (dApps).What is an RPC Node?The RPC node is a specialized node in a blockchain network, a server, that allows interactions with the blockchain remotely via Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) using various tools and libraries.They enable seamless integration and communication with blockchain networks, making it easier to build and deploy dApps. For example, It's essential for operations that involve sending RPC requests using Node.js scripts or applicationsThis means developers can use HTTP, WebSocket, or gRPC to communicate with the GetBlock’s node via JSON-RPC requests to perform specific actions or retrieve data without running a crypto node and maintaining it themselves. This makes development more accessible and scalable.RPC Node vs Validator NodeRPC nodes primarily provide a way to query data from the blockchain and broadcast transactions to the network data for crypto wallets, explorers, dApps, and other services. They expose RPC Node API that allows external applications to read data from the blockchain, send transactions, check balances, get block details, and more. Validator nodes are mainly focused on securing the blockchain through participation in the consensus process rather than offering their node for crypto operations and blockchain connectivity. Validator nodes often earn rewards (like transaction fees or staking rewards). If you don't need these incentives and you prefer a straightforward way to connect to the blockchain or integrate Web3 functionality into your dApp, RPC Node blockchain services are a better fit.How to Run a Crypto NodeWith crypto node hosting services like GetBlock, you can easily access a pre-configured node RPC Server or set up and manage your private node for crypto transactions and dApp development.Step 1: Choose the best RPC node option for youGetBlock offers node RPC access for over 50 blockchains in main and test networks via different types of services:Full nodes: Perfect for developers needing complete access to the blockchainArchive nodes: Ideal for applications requiring historical data.Dedicated nodes: For those who need private access and highest-performance servers.Shared nodes: A cost-effective solution for smaller projects or initial testing phases.Public RPC: Free plan with optimal node performance.Step 2: Create an endpoint in a clickWith GetBlock’s RPC Node API, learning how to run a node crypto is simplified with intuitive interfaces, automated RPC URL retrieval, and detailed documentation, allowing even beginners to manage nodes with easeStep 3: Manage expenses while expanding your projectConsider the node crypto price that aligns with your budget and goals, whether small projects to large-scale operations. As your requirements grow, you can easily scale up to a higher tier, ensuring that running a node for all your crypto needs remains cost-effective.Choose your option and start running your crypto node today!New messageConnect with the GetBlock teamEthereumethBitcoinbtcBNB Smart ChainbscPolygonmaticAvalancheavaxFantomftmOptimismopTrontrxBlastblastopBNBopbnbXRPxrpGnosis ChaingnoLitecoinltcHuobi ECO ChainhecoArbitrumarbThetathetaAptosaptNear ProtocolnearBitcoin CashbchZCashzecFuse.iofuseDogeCoindogeHarmonyoneCronoscroMoonbeamglmrPolkadotdotMoonrivermovrCardanoadaKusamaksmEthereum ClassicetcKuCoin Community Chain kccRskrskNEMxemTerra 2.0lunaDashdashCosmosatomTONtonNervos NetworkckbOntologyontBitgertbitgertTezosxtz Bitcoin-SVbsvSyscoinsysBitcoin GoldbtgStarkNetstrkMoneroxmrDigiBytedgbNEOneoAlgorandalgoBitTorrent ChainbttcEthereum (Firehose)firehose-ethBytecoinbcnVeChainvetWaveswavesWaxwaxpWemixwemixBeldexbdxZilliqazilzkSynczksyncCeloceloPolygon (Firehose)firehose-maticBNB Smart Chain (Firehose)firehose-bscScrollscrollFraxfraxInjectiveinjDymensiondymRoninronBASEbaseBand ProtocolbandpulsechainpulseMinaminaMetismetisMantlemantleOKTChainoktLinealineaKromakromaKlaytnklayIRISnetirisPolygon zkEVMpolygon-zkevmMoonbase-Alphamoonbase-alphaIOTAmiotaSolanasolHivehiveSuisuiFlowflowFilecoinfilFactomfctChiachiaOther0/300
