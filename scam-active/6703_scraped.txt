International Securities and Markets Authority
International Securities and Markets Authority is an international regulator providing public assistance and means of protection and guidance to investors in today's complex world of international mergers and acquisitions. International Securities and Markets Authority enforces and implements international securities laws related to Mergers and Acquisitions.
Due to the increasing number of unregulated offshore management firms, International Securities and Markets Authority was created in 2002 to perform international market regulations. Since then, more than 100,000 securities firms that are dealing with private placements, divestiture services, and mergers & acquisitions including their respective branch offices have filed and registered with International Securities and Markets Authority.
International Securities and Markets Authority member firms have complied with the strictest due diligence process and continuous business practice monitoring and policy implementation for the benefit of the public investors.
International Securities and Markets Authority deals with the world's major markets through efficient administering of mergers and acquisitions policies, providing a high standard of information and/or assistance to the general public, implementing international securities laws, and resolving disputes arising from regulatory issues between investors and securities firms.
To date, International Securities and Markets Authority has approximately 200 employees, including on-hand experts in various fields of expertise, who are dedicated to educate the investors with the essential understanding of trading securities internationally and to assist them in a convenient and lawful way which ensures investors' security and protection.
Given the complexity of international trading, International Securities and Markets Authority maintains its public trusts and confidence by keeping the integrity and fairness of the market globally, protecting public investors, and guaranteeing a successful securities industry.
