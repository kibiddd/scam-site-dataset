Introduction
A revolutionary solution for crypto mining.
WHAT IS BNB Smart mining?
BNB Smart mining is a blockchain agreement. It is like a decentralized
central bank
that
establishes a currency market through smart contracts. The money market is based on the
supply and
demand of assets, and the interest rate of the asset pool is derived through algorithms.
Providers of
USDT assets (participants, we call them "miners") , directly interact with smart
contract agreements
without any actual mortgage, and automatically earn floating interest rates, without
negotiating
maturity and interest rates or collateral,and other with peers or counterparties
Terms.
HOW IT WORKS?
It allows USDT holders to automatically explore the borrowing needs
of the
currency
market, and automatically match higher interest orders, after agreeing to authorize the
execution of
this contract (becoming a "miner"). It is an AMM mechanism and an automatic
quantification procedure.
Your deposit is always in your own wallet without withdrawal, and you can withdraw the
interest earned
to your wallet at any time. Become a "miner", hand over to the smart contract agreement,
and
automatically earn income!
WHERE WE'RE GOING?
The crypto economy is a radical new imagining of the future of work.
Open
protocols
will create transparency and opportunity, enabling anyone in the world to contribute
their talents to
a
global economy. We want to support this vision and build the new coordination mechanisms
of the
internet
age.

need to
learn about blockchain to participate in mining.
Jena Karlis Store Owner
My friend spent tens of thousands of dollars on computer mining and he had no idea that
I was
earning
even more than him on until the last time he found out and I invited him to get
involved and
he has now sold his computer.
Matt Brandon Freelancer
I've now quit my job and started doing what I love to do and I've been to over 10
countries. There
are
many ways to be financially free, and when you can live well without working, that's
financial
freedom. Thanks to the developers at .
John Larson Freelancer
At first, I put a small amount of USDT in my wallet and then spent a month to evaluate
the effect.
The
numbers shown on the final statement made up my mind to continue using it. It is so
amazing that I
don't need to do any operation to get profit.
Jake Robinson financial analyst
It's hard to imagine that I could make a profit while I'm busy raising three kids and having a job; all I need to do is to put the money from my savings into the wallet and just watch it grow, thanks to technology these days!
Hannah Meyer  Purchasing Agent
I spent a long time trying to get a stable passive income. But my stocks made me lose a lot of money. I was desperate until I found this platform. Thanks to the developers of ESM-ETH, now I don't even need to learn about blockchain to participate in mining and making money!
Freya Lindberg Store Owner
My friend spent tens of thousands of dollars on computer mining and he had no idea that I was earning even more than him because I'm using liquidity mining. I showed him my results and invited him to join me; and now he has sold his mining machine.
Jacob Williams Freelancer
I had a typical office job before, but now Iâve quit my job and started traveling around the world while I'm making money! This is the answer you've been seeking for if the life you want is the life that Iâm living.
