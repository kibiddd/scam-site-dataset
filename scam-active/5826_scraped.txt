CFDs trading involves significant risk. We
strongly advise that you read our Terms & Conditions. Although the
risk when trading CFDs is fixed for each individual trade, the
trades are live and it is possible to lose an initial investment,
particularly if a trader chooses to place his entire investment to a
single live trade. It is highly recommended that traders choose a
proper money management strategy which limits the total consecutive
trades or total outstanding investment.
