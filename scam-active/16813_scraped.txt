Ask Us.Q&ABefore visit：After visit：1. When will I receive my service fee refund?Refunds of service fees are already in the process of approval, with a maximum of 48 hours for refunds from VIVEFRANCE.2. How long will it take for me to receive my contract?In most cases, after receiving confirmation that the documents have been approved, the release of the contract is not determined by our company, but by the efficiency of the hosting partner or landlord. Our company will instruct and urge the partner or landlord to proceed with the production of the contract as fast as we can.3. Can we replace furniture?In most cases, landlords of furnished properties will not consider replacing large furniture.As Paris is a tight rental area, finding the property you want is not an easy task and there are often other competitors applying for the same property.When a landlord has more than one tenant to choose from, asking to replace the furniture may cause you to miss out on the property.However, VIVEFRANCE's rental history has given us a number of partners with our tenants as a priority, so VIVEFRANCE has a say in such demand situations and we will go to the landlord's end to negotiate and accommodate bilateral needs where possible.4. Why do I need to pay two months' rent as a deposit?Empty accommodationThe amount of the security deposit must not exceed 1 month's rent (excluding charges), and it must be stated in the lease.The landlord cannot increase the amount of the deposit during the lease or when the lease is renewed.Furnished accommodationThe amount of the security deposit must not exceed 2 months' rent (excluding charges), and it must be stated in the lease.The landlord cannot increase the amount of the security deposit during the course of the lease, or when the lease is renewed./Logement videLe montant du dépôt de garantie ne doit pas dépasser 1 mois de loyer (hors charges), et il doit être indiqué dans le bail.Le proproriétaire ne peut pas augmenter le montant du dépôt de garantie en cours de bail, ni au renouvellement du bail.Logement meubléLe montant du dépôt de garantie ne doit pas dépasser 2 mois de loyer (hors charges), et il doit être indiqué dans le bail.Le proproriétaire ne peut pas augmenter le montant du dépôt de garantie en cours de bail, ni au renouvellement du bail.5. Can I prepay 6 months' rent or one year's rent to rent a place without a guarantor？Generally, agents and landlords determine whether a tenant is able to rent their property based on income and savings. So if you do not have a qualified French base guarantor and French base income, the best solution is to use assurance loyers impayer. Before EDL entree：1. How long does it take to get a response from the landlord？Hello, we have optimised your documents and submitted them to our partner, and will normally obtain a response from the partner within three days.In special cases, there may be more than one reviewer and the review time will be extended. Also, based on the big data of the real estate rental industry, the longer the review time, the lower the success rate of renting the property, so please still check VIVEFRANCE and our staff will take you to continue the matching of properties and visits.2. Why do I have to pay the rent and deposit before signing the contract?In the situation that the French landlord or agency has not received the deposit and rent, they will not choose to sign the housing contract in a risk management mentality and the date of signing will be indefinitely delayed until the day of arrival due to this.In addition, as French law requires housing insurance to be in place before moving in, the signed contract must be submitted to the insurance company to obtain housing insurance before moving in.Combining these two parts of the law, in the case that you choose to sign a contract and pay on the day of arrival.Firstly, there is no guarantee that the money paid has successfully reached the account of the landlord or agency. If the payment does not arrive due to the bank, the landlord and the agency will have to go through a very time-consuming and cumbersome legal process to recover this amount from the tenant if the tenant does not cooperate. They are definitely not willing to bear the time cost and risk of this.Secondly, even in the case of a successful payment and a successful signing, the housing insurance is not available at the time of signing the housing contract, making it impossible to move in on the same day.So, with so much uncertainty in the process, landlords and agencies prefer tenants who are able to have their rent and deposit payment in place before signing the contract, which avoids risk.VIVEFRANCE's rental business since 2017 already has a very large number of landlords and partners who have a trust base. In the case that a payment is made but the contract is not signed, we will provide legal assistance to help you recover this amount.During EDL entree：After-sales：1. How long does it take to refund a deposit?It takes one month. The landlord may be able to apply for an extension of this time if there are special circumstances such as major renovations.2What if I haven't received my deposit refund after more than a month?You can use the template attached to the link below to send a registered letter to the landlord if you have contacted the landlord and still haven't received your deposit.https://www.service-public.fr/simulateur/calcul/RemboursementDepotGarantie845 297 092 R.C.S.
