North Korea (¬†listen), officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK; Chos≈èn'g≈≠l:¬†Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÎØºÏ£ºÏ£ºÏùòÏù∏ÎØºÍ≥µÌôîÍµ≠; hancha:¬†ÊúùÈÆÆÊ∞ë‰∏ª‰∏ªÁæ©‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂúã; MR:¬†Chos≈èn Minjuju≈≠i Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The name Korea is derived from the Kingdom of Goguryeo, also spelled as Kory≈è. The capital and largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China to the north and northwest, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers, and a small section of the Tumen River also forms a border with Russia to the northeast. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the boundary between North Korea and South Korea.
Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into two zones by the United States and the Soviet Union, with the north occupied by the Soviets and the south by the Americans. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950‚Äì53). Although the Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, no official peace treaty was ever signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991.

Korea
Korea, called Chos≈èn (Korean: Ï°∞ÏÑ†; Hanja: ÊúùÈÆÆ) in North Korea and Hanguk (Korean: ÌïúÍµ≠; Hanja: ÈüìÂúã) or Daehanminkuk (Korean: ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠; Hanja: Â§ßÈüìÊ∞ëÂúã) in South Korea, is an East Asian territory that is divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea, formally the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and South Korea, formally the Republic of Korea (ROK). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan .
Korea emerged as a singular political entity after centuries of conflict among the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which were unified as Silla (57 BC ‚Äì AD 935) and Balhae (AD 698 ‚Äì 926). The united Silla was eventually succeeded by Goryeo in 935 at the end of the Later Three Kingdoms period.  Goryeo, which gave name to the modern exonym "Korea", was a highly cultured state and created the Jikji in the 14th century. The invasions by the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, however, greatly weakened the nation, which forced it into vassalage. After the Yuan dynasty's collapse, severe political strife followed. Goryeo eventually fell to an uprising led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon in 1388.

What Does North Korea Trade With The World?
The US slapped North Korea with new sanctions on September 26th. These sanctions follow an executive order and two United Nations sanctions packages.
The sanctions attempt to put economic pressure on Kim Jong Un to end his regime's nuclear ambitions.
So who is North Korea trading with?
Well, mainly China. $2.3 billion of $2.83 billion total exports were shipped to China in 2015, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. That's 83% of all of North Korea's exports. Besides China, export partners include Pakistan, India and Burkina Faso. Coal briquettes were North Korea's largest export in 2015 (a briquette is a compressed brick of coal dust). They were followed by knit and non-knit clothing. North Korea also exported silver, wood products, and processed fish.

How Western businessmen make money from North Korea - BBC News
For most business people, North Korea is the last country they would consider trading with. Its widely condemned nuclear programme means it's under heavy sanctions, and there's the potential for bad publicity because of its human rights record.
But not all trade is under sanction, and a small group of Western businessmen have spotted an opportunity.  Not only that, but they believe doing business is the best way to bring the regime around.

North Korea/China - Trade Zone
(12 Nov 1997) T/I:   10:08:16
Residents of North Korea's Rajin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone are permitted to do something their fellow countrymen outside the zone cannot do -- engage in private enterprise. Since the beginning of June, the government has approved the operation of kiosks or private market stalls, household restaurants and the exchange of goods for money or by barter with other North Koreans and with visiting foreigners.
The zone was proclaimed in 1991 and established along the lines of special enterprise zones in China. It is geared towards attracting foreign investment to restore the huge drop in foreign currency trade which followed the collapse of the Communist trade bloc. But this year the opportunity to pursue private trade was also made available to resid...

Following the UN sanctions, China agreed to halt some trade. Imports of textiles from North Korea were banned, and exports of petroleum products were limited.
Other import partners include India, Russia, Mexico, and Thailand.
The UN and US sanctions follow multiple nuclear tests in North Korea.
President Trump has said that military options are also on the table.

Since the beginning of June, the government has approved the operation of kiosks or private market stalls, household restaurants and the exchange of goods for money or by barter with other North Koreans and with visiting foreigners.
The zone was proclaimed in 1991 and established along the lines of special enterprise zones in China. It is geared towards attracting foreign investment to restore the huge drop in foreign currency trade which followed the collapse of the Communist trade bloc. But this year the opportunity to pursue private trade was also made available to residents used to living under a state-controlled economy.
The most dramatic response to the approval of small-scale private enterprise has been the establishment of neighbourhood kiosks from which local residents sell home-made food products, alcohol, cigarettes and crafts.
A few households in Rajin have taken advantage of the new law by opening dog meat restaurants in their homes. These have proven popular with locals, visiting Chinese and some visiting foreigners.

The US slapped North Korea with new sanctions on September 26th. These sanctions follow an executive order and two United Nations sanctions packages.
The sanctions attempt to put economic pressure on Kim Jong Un to end his regime's nuclear ambitions.
So who is North Korea trading with?
Well, mainly China. $2.3 billion of $2.83 billion total exports were shipped to China in 2015, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. That's 83% of all of North Korea's exports. Besides China, export partners include Pakistan, India and Burkina Faso. Coal briquettes were North Korea's largest export in 2015 (a briquette is a compressed brick of coal dust). They were followed by knit and non-knit clothing. North Korea also exported silver, wood products, and processed fish.
Following the UN sanctions, China agreed to halt some trade. Imports of textiles from North Korea were banned, and exports of petroleum products were limited.
Other import partners include India, Russia, Mexico, and Thailand.
The UN and US sanctions follow multiple nuclear tests in North Korea.
President Trump has said that military options are also on the table.

For most business people, North Korea is the last country they would consider trading with. Its widely condemned nuclear programme means it's under heavy sanctions, and there's the potential for bad publicity because of its human rights record.
But not all trade is under sanction, and a small group of Western businessmen have spotted an opportunity.  Not only that, but they believe doing business is the best way to bring the regime around.

North Korea (¬†listen), officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK; Chos≈èn'g≈≠l:¬†Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÎØºÏ£ºÏ£ºÏùòÏù∏ÎØºÍ≥µÌôîÍµ≠; hancha:¬†ÊúùÈÆÆÊ∞ë‰∏ª‰∏ªÁæ©‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂúã; MR:¬†Chos≈èn Minjuju≈≠i Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The name Korea is derived from the Kingdom of Goguryeo, also spelled as Kory≈è. The capital and largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China to the north and northwest, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers, and a small section of the Tumen River also forms a border with Russia to the northeast. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the boundary between North Korea and South Korea.
Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into two zones by the United States and the Soviet Union, with the north occupied by the Soviets and the south by the Americans. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950‚Äì53). Although the Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, no official peace treaty was ever signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991.
