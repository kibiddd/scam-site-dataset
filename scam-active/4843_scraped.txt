Sale procedure for f2ff.com
Once we agree on the price for the sale of this domain name, our representative will add a "Buy now" button to this page.
Clicking the "Buy now" button automatically creates a transaction for you to buy f2ff.com using a third-party trusted escrow platform. This service is normally provided by escrow.com.
escrow.com provide a strong buyer and seller protection service and they operate the leading worldwide escrow platform. They are accredited by the California Department of Business Oversight, the Better Business Bureau (they won the 2017 BBB Award for Ethics) and are a partner of the International Trade Administration.
You will need an account with the escrow provider to complete the transaction. After clicking the "Buy now" button, you can log in if you already have an account or create one in just a few minutes.Please note: some simple identity verification steps might be required.
For both your protection and our protection, the escrow service provider acts as an intermediary for the domain name sale transaction. You will be able to pay directly to the escrow account using a multitude of payment options. The escrow service provider will only release the funds to us after we transfer ownership for the domain name.
The escrow services must be paid by the buyer and are not included in the domain name sale price. This price is calculated as a small percentage of the entire transaction.Under certain circumstances we can use the current domain name registrar (such as GoDaddy, Epik, NameSilo, etc.) as an escrow agent to have a very fast (almost instant) ownership transfer.Please note: this is a premium service with higher escrow cost and is not available for all transactions.
