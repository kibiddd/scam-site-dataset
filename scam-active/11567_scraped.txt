How to trade options in four steps
* Investment objectives. - This usually includes income, growth, capital preservation or
speculation.
* Trading experience. - The broker will want to know your knowledge of investing, how long
you’ve been trading
stocks or options, how many trades you make per year and the size of your trades.
* Personal financial information. - Have on hand your liquid net worth (or investments
easily sold for cash),
annual income, total net worth and employment information.
* The types of options you want to trade. - For instance, calls, puts or spreads. And
whether they are covered
or naked. The seller or writer of options has an obligation to deliver the underlying stock if the option is
exercised. If the writer also owns the underlying stock, the option position is covered. If the option
position is left unprotected, it's naked.
Options trading
Options trading is when you buy or sell an underlying asset at a pre-negotiated price by a certain future
date.
Trading stock options can be complex — even more so than stock trading. When you buy a stock, you just
decide how many shares you want, and your broker fills the order at the prevailing market price or a limit
price you set. Options trading requires an understanding of advanced strategies, and the process for opening
an options trading account includes a few more steps than opening a typical investment account.
In 2022, the stock market has seen its share of highs and lows amid concerns about inflation, Russia's
invasion of Ukraine and rising oil prices. When the market is volatile, options trading often increases,
says Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial
Research.
“You can use options to speculate and to gamble, but the reality is ... the best use of options is to
protect your downside,” he says. "Options are one way to generate income when the markets aren’t going up.”
According to the Options Clearing Corporation, there were 939 million options contracts traded in March
2022, up 4.5% compared with March 2021. It was second-highest trading month on record.
