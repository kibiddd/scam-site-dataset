NEW REQUIRED SECURITIES AND MAINTENANCE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
EFFECTIVE 1ST OF AUGUST
Dear Client,
On August 1st, 2018, new regulatory measures came into force. The European Securities and Markets Authority Decision 796 of 22 May 2018, imposing restrictions to all non-professional traders within the European Union is taken under Article 40 of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council and is therefore compulsory to all citizens and CFDs providers in the EU it concerns. You can read the full decision here. The following measures are intended to provide you with better protection when trading high risk leveraged investment products like CFDs:
New Required Securities Requirement (RSR) which varies depending on the CFD underlying asset. This means that the amount required from you to open a new position will be higher:
PRODUCT RANGE
NEW MAXIMUM LEVERAGE
RSR for CFD position of $1000
CFDs on MAJOR CURRENCY PAIRS
30:1
$33.33
CFDs on NON-MAJOR CURRENCY PAIRS
20:1
$50
CFDS on MAJOR INDICES
20:1
$50
CFDs on NON-MAJOR INDICES
10:1
$100
CFDs on GOLD
20:1
$50
CFDs on COMMODITIES other than Gold
10:1
$100
CFDs on SHARES, ETFs & BONDS
5:1
$200
CFDs on CRYPTOCURRENCIES
2:1
$500
New Maintenance Margin Requirement (MMR) - this is the amount that must be held on your account in order to maintain Your positions open. It is 50% of the Required Securities Requirement;
New Margin close-out rule - when your account equity equals the MMR we have to close out one or more of Your opened positions in CFDs;
The negative balance protection that we have been providing you for a long time is now compulsory for all EU CFDs providers - this means that a retail client can never lose more than they have deposited.
Restrictions on the incentives offered to retail clients to trade CFDs - all bonuses and other monetary and non-monetary benefits other than, insofar as they relate to CFDs, information and research tools, in relation to the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs are now forbidden.
New risk warning requirement - we are now required to provide all retail investors with the percentage of our retail investor CFD trading accounts that lost money over the last 12-month period.
