How it works
Trusted by global utilities to keep networks safe and online in hurricanes, heat waves, hail storms, and more.
Outages and safety incidents are no surprise when you can only see a small fraction of your network at a time — and only see your assets and vegetation on their best behavior.
You’re trying to prioritize equipment maintenance, trim jobs, and capital projects — but you can only prioritize solutions to risks you can see.
You need to understand exactly how your assets will respond to severe weather — but field surveys only happen on fair weather days.
You need to prove your plan will actually solve reliability and resilience challenges — but measuring outcomes looks like guesswork.
Network governance is 80% reactive and 20% proactive. For utilities using Neara, it’s the other way around.
1. Generate behaviorally identical digital model of your entire network.
Every asset bends, deforms, and sways in response to >100mph winds, flash floods, and more exactly as it does in field. Correct GIS errors and set the record straight on every asset location, configuration, and
clearance measurement.
2. Execute network-wide simulation analyses so you know exactly what to expect in the field.
Simulate scenarios like severe weather and new network design to pinpoint key vulnerabilities and test-drive potential remediation solutions before spending a dollar or breaking ground in the field.
3. Run reports that quantify network needs and measure outcomes.
Need to validate your vegetation budget number? Demonstrate which poles actually need replacement? Justify your new transmission line? Objectively define network needs with demonstrable data regulators and other key stakeholders will understand.

Success stories
While piloting Neara, we were able to simulate the impact of major flooding in late March. Rather than wait for digital inspections we eliminated 300 hours of inspection time and targeted our response to customers that needed assistance most.
- Scott Ryan, Chief Asset & Operating Officer, Endeavor Energy
CASE STUDY
By monitoring water and clearance levels daily, SA Power Networks was able to leave power on for longer for many customers as the floodwaters rose and also restore power more quickly as water receded. This innovative approach allowed for the re-energisation of power lines within five days, compared with the originally anticipated three-week timeframe using traditional manual methods.
- Doug Schmidt, General Manager, Network Management
CASE STUDY
We have found that the temperature our lines can operate at is much higher than we previously understood. Historically, we have had to apply a crude standard across the network. By modeling each span individually, we found that in many parts, the capacity is twice as high as we previously thought.
- John Cleland, CEO, Essential Energy
