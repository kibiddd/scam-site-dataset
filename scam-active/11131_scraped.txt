MetaTrader Expert Advisors
Here you can download MT4 and MT5 expert advisors (EAs, also called robots) that can be used with the MetaTrader Forex trading platform to enhance your currency trading results with the completely automated trading or simple expert advising (signals you can choose whether to act on or not). The MetaTrader expert advisors presented here implement the best trading strategies. They are free and open-source, so you can test and change them as you like before applying them to your real or demo Forex account. The results of my own testing are also shown for your convenience. The top expert advisors were selected to yield considerable profit with low maximum drawdown during backtests. You will need an account with some of the MT4 Forex brokers to use any of the MT4 EAs presented here. If you want to use an MT5 EA, you would need to open an account with a broker that supports the MT5 version of the platform.
If you experience any problems whole installing a MetaTrader expert advisor on your platform, please refer to this tutorial

As you can see in the table above, all MetaTrader expert advisors can be divided into two broad categories:
MT4 expert advisors that are coded using MQL4 language and that can only be run inside MetaTrader 4 platform.
MT5 expert advisors that are coded using MQL5 language and that can only be run inside MetaTrader 5 platform.
However, for some of the presented MetaTrader expert advisors, the code is available in two versions: one version in MQL4 for MT4 and another version in MQL5 for MT5. Please make sure you are using the right code version depending on your platform of choice.
If you want to share your own expert advisor or if you want to comment on any Forex robot (EA) presented here, please visit our forum on MetaTrader expert advisors
