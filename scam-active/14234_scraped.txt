The MinerDog solution is not in any way affected by these and many other challenges witnessed in the crypto industry due to the solution-based structure. Our platform does not require market liquidity. Hence, your investments and expected incomes are safe because we are not dependent on changes in the industry. Instead, we've built a solution based on the attraction of new users but running on a MinerDog contract! Our code and structure are safe with guaranteed longevity and transparency. Therefore, we have a very attractive and robust referral program with detailed and transparent statistics for each promoter/user. Earnings for promoters as well as other user's incomes are added to profiles in real-time, and unlike other DeFi investment solutions, one can withdraw their funds instantly and at any time.
How it
Works
Our solution is a computerized transaction protocol that automatically implements the terms of a contract between two parties. Similar to the common contract, both users in our platform will have to define the rules and terms of engagement while transacting. Upon agreement and initiation of the MinerDog contract, it runs as designed with zero chance of orchestrating an alterationto pre-determined conditions. Initiating activities on MinerDog, users must have a balance available on the contract (minimum 100 USDT). The rest users leave it to the contract to implement with no more long sitting hours tocheck when to sell or buy. Therefore, as per contract terms, it ensures your Investment value never drops; instead, it delivers to our users 100 percent profits.
