Purchased my First order that arrived today. Took some time but it’s Christmas ��…Anyway I ordered (two) Cohiba Siglo VI sticks and put them under a Blacklight test! P-E-R-F-E-C-T…This test on Cohiba should show 3 blue diagonal dots near the Indian Head…The Blacklight will also show the Serial numbers along the yellow band! EXCELLENT � On both!
