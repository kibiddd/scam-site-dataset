Who we are
Our team is comprised of professional traders with extensive experience in the forex market. We have been trading for over 10 years and have helped over 600,000 readers to find the most reliable forex broker for them.
So, why do we do it? For starters, we were once in your position. As new traders, we were confused by the sheer number of forex brokers around and we struggled to understand the fees and the jargon that brokers use in their terms and conditions. We’d also heard horror stories (and experienced a few ourselves) of seemingly legit forex brokers who turned out to be less genuine than they appeared. We knew there had to be a better way.
After having gained several years of trading experience, we developed a reliable way of testing brokers that gave us consistent results. We’d also started receiving questions from other traders. Which brokers do we prefer? Which brokers are the very best? How can you tell?
Why use FX Beam?
We are a team of experts with over 10 years of trading experience. In this time, we've reviewed over 200 brokers and have come across the good, the bad and the ugly.
Our experience means that we know exactly what you need from a forex broker, and which brokers deliver it.
All of our reviews focus on over 200 criteria points. This includes considering trading platforms, bonuses, account types, fees and more.
Our reviews allow you to select the best forex broker for you, based on what’s most important to your trading activities.
We help you to save time, money and stress. Our experts spend several days carefully reviewing each broker we come across so that you don’t have to.
We help traders to not only find great brokers but to progress in their trading career.
Our industry insiders and news reporters bring you educational guides, up to date market analysis, and more.
With our help, you’ll avoid scam and rogue brokers. Our accurate methodology ensures that we will never recommend an unlicensed or disreputable broker - they simply won't pass our testing process.
What is forex trading?
Forex trading involves the purchase and/or sale of currencies. Just like with stocks, you buy a currency and then sell it when its value has increased or vice versa. It sometimes might seem a little more difficult because currencies are traded in pairs, which means you will be using one currency to purchase another. So, if you are trading EUR/USD, for example, you will buy EUR for USD.
In binary trading, you are basically betting that the underlying asset will go either up or down over a certain period of time. The only way you can make a profit is if you’re right. If you’re wrong, you lose. The profit is also fixed.
Conversely, in forex trading, you can still make a profit even if you are partially right. So, with binary trading, if you bet on the fact that the EUR/USD will rise over 1.3250 over the next three days, even if it rises continuously but experiences a momentary drop to below 1.3250 precisely at the moment when your trade closes, you’ve lost. With forex trading, you can exit the market the moment you see the trade starting to go in the opposite direction and still make a profit.
