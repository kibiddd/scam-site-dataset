What Others Are Saying
Delicious iced tea with a social mission
I wasn’t expecting to love the taste of it as much as I do. I have replaced much of my coffee consumption with Wize Tea. Can’t recommend it enough.
- CARLIE C
Awesome product
I have now basically switched to Wize Tea from regular coffee. This sampler pack let’s you try out all the flavours
- LISA J
Smooth and delicious
Mouth feels clean and refreshed after a few sips. Very uplifting and energizing for all day drink with no jitters or crash.

I didn’t know what to expect but I loved it
Everyone in the house so far likes it too. It’s not green tea or any tea you’ve had before but that’s a good thing. The flavor stands on its own as fresh without being grassy, deep without being malty. Enjoy!
