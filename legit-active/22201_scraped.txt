41st Canadian Parliament
The 41st Canadian Parliament was in session from June 2, 2011 to August 2, 2015, with the membership of its House of Commons having been determined by the results of the 2011 federal election held on May 2, 2011. Parliament convened on June 2, 2011, with the election of Andrew Scheer as Speaker, followed the next day with the Speech from the Throne. There were two sessions in this Parliament. On August 2, 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and issue the writ of election, leading to an 11-week election campaign period for the 2015 federal election.
Party standings
Major bills and motions
In the parliament's first session, the House of Commons met for 14 days in June, between the end of election and before the summer recess, and 6 bills were given royal assent, all on June 26. The Restoring Mail Delivery for Canadians Act (Bill C-6) was adopted despite 58 hours of continuous debate. The 2011 Canadian federal budget was quickly passed and while only the Conservatives voted in favour of the appropriation acts, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and Green Party joined them in voting in favour of the budget implementation bill Supporting Vulnerable Seniors and Strengthening Canada's Economy Act (Bill C-3) which enacted several spending measures promised in the budget, such as increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplements for seniors. The Fair and Efficient Criminal Trials Act (Bill C-2) authorizing federal judges to hear all pretrial motions at once during mega-trials, was introduced on June 13 and was supported by the Conservative, New Democratic and Liberal parties.

Member of parliament
A member of parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title, such as senate, and thus also have different titles for its members, such as senator.
Members of parliament tend to form parliamentary groups (also called parliamentary parties) with members of the same political party.
Westminster system
The Westminster system is a democratic parliamentary system of government modelled after the politics of the United Kingdom. This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Australia
A member of parliament is a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Commonwealth (federal) parliament. Members may use "MP" after their names; "MHR" is not used, although it was used as a post-nominal in the past. A member of the upper house of the Commonwealth parliament, the Senate, is known as a "Senator".

Parliament of Canada
The Parliament of Canada (French: Parlement du Canada) is the federal legislative branch of Canada, seated at Parliament Hill in the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario. The body consists of the Canadian monarch, represented by a viceroy, the governor general; an upper house: the Senate; and a lower house: the House of Commons. Each element has its own officers and organization. The governor general summons and appoints each of the 105 senators on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, while the 338 members of the House of Commons‚Äîcalled members of parliament (MPs)‚Äîare directly elected by eligible Canadian voters, with each MP representing a single electoral district, commonly referred to as a riding.
By constitutional convention, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of parliament, the Senate and Crown rarely opposing its will. The Senate reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint and the monarch or viceroy provides the necessary Royal Assent to make bills into law. The governor general also summons parliament, while either the viceroy or monarch can prorogue or dissolve parliament, the latter in order to call a general election. Either will read the Throne Speech. The most recent parliament, summoned by Governor General David Johnston on 2 June 2011, was the 41st since Confederation in 1867.

Parliament member Shanendon Cartwright, frustrated after Speaker Patricia Deveaux did not let him speak, was seen rushing up where she was seated, grabbing the parliamentary mace, a heavy ceremonial staff, off the bench, and then tossing it out a nearby window.

Chaos erupts in House of Commons as Trudeau, Poilievre exchange personal attacks
Question period took place once again on Wednesday in the House of Commons, where Conservative Party of Canada leader Pierre Poilievre and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took up much of the hour exchanging and disagreeing on the topic of foreign election interference and how to approach it.

Poilevre and Trudeau also accused one another of being conceited, with the Conservative leader saying if Trudeau were made of chocolate, "he would eat himself!"

Bahamas News Today |  Tensions In Bahamas Parliament, Lawmaker Throws The Symbolic Mace Out | N18G
Parliament member Shanendon Cartwright, frustrated after Speaker Patricia Deveaux did not let him speak, was seen rushing up where she was seated, grabbing the parliamentary mace, a heavy ceremonial staff, off the bench, and then tossing it out a nearby window. He, alongside several ally lawmakers, were forced out of the building by police.It comes after U.S. federal prosecutors charged several high-ranking Bahamian police officials with facilitating the flow of cocaine into the U.S. in exchange for bribes.The move harks back to 1965, when the leader of the opposition threw the mace out of a window in a push for political change, an event that became known as "Black Tuesday."

41st Canadian Parliament
The 41st Canadian Parliament was in session from June 2, 2011 to August 2, 2015, with the membership of its House of Commons having been determined by the results of the 2011 federal election held on May 2, 2011. Parliament convened on June 2, 2011, with the election of Andrew Scheer as Speaker, followed the next day with the Speech from the Throne. There were two sessions in this Parliament. On August 2, 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and issue the writ of election, leading to an 11-week election campaign period for the 2015 federal election.
Party standings
Major bills and motions
In the parliament's first session, the House of Commons met for 14 days in June, between the end of election and before the summer recess, and 6 bills were given royal assent, all on June 26. The Restoring Mail Delivery for Canadians Act (Bill C-6) was adopted despite 58 hours of continuous debate. The 2011 Canadian federal budget was quickly passed and while only the Conservatives voted in favour of the appropriation acts, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and Green Party joined them in voting in favour of the budget implementation bill Supporting Vulnerable Seniors and Strengthening Canada's Economy Act (Bill C-3) which enacted several spending measures promised in the budget, such as increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplements for seniors. The Fair and Efficient Criminal Trials Act (Bill C-2) authorizing federal judges to hear all pretrial motions at once during mega-trials, was introduced on June 13 and was supported by the Conservative, New Democratic and Liberal parties.

The debate on the Liberals' stand-alone motion to put a capital gains tax adjustment in place continued in the House of Commons during question period on Tuesday. The debate came after the Conservatives released a statement saying they would oppose the motion."
According to him [Justin Trudeau], the total net-worth of the richest Canadians has doubled since he took office. Meanwhile, nine in 10 middle class Canadians are paying more tax," said Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre.
"There's an opportunity for everyone in this house to stand-up and ask the wealthiest Canadians to pay a little more when they sell extremely profitable investments," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. He added "The Conservatives will be protecting the advantage that is there for the wealthiest Canadians."
"Real-world impacts. That's what we have left after nine years of this prime minister promising to tax, borrow and spend us into fairness," Poilievre said.

The House of Commons Chamber, at the west end of the Centre Block, is decorated in green in the tradition of the British House of Commons. Stone carvings, stained glass windows and other artistic representations of Canada's history decorate the Chamber, as a constant reminder of the Canadians that Members of Parliament represent and serve.
MPs are elected to represent Canada's 338 constituencies. In the Commons Chamber, Members devote most of their time to debating and voting on bills. The Chamber is also a place where Members represent constituents' views, discuss national issues and call on the government to explain its actions.

Question period took place once again on Wednesday in the House of Commons, where Conservative Party of Canada leader Pierre Poilievre and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took up much of the hour exchanging and disagreeing on the topic of foreign election interference and how to approach it.
But that didn't last long before both leaders went at one another in a series of personal attacks. First, Poilievre made reference to Trudeau's background as a high school teacher, promoting the Canadian Prime Minister to ask what job Poilevre held before entering politics.
Poilevre and Trudeau also accused one another of being conceited, with the Conservative leader saying if Trudeau were made of chocolate, "he would eat himself!"
Speaker of the House Anthony Rota, on several occasions, attempted to calm the crowd, but seemingly, to no avail.
Even the Leader of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet, stepped in to add his own two cents.
