A letter delivered to your inbox that challenges assumptions about the good life, proclaims the inherent belovedness of every human being, and envisions a world of belonging where everyone matters.
A gifted communicator, Amy Julia combines razor-sharp intellect and pastoral presence which afford a much needed clarity to otherwise complex and contentious issues. For this reason and others, her voice has a particular relevance for our present moment.
Kevin BrownPresident, Asbury University
I want to read every word Amy Julia Becker writes. No one I know captures so completely the ache and the joy of being human.
Andy CrouchAuthor of Strong and Weak
I first met Amy Julia Becker in a classic “privilege” moment. She was an editor. I was a writer. I am black. She is white. . . . In her I found a brave combination of many things I respect . . . namely, restraint, fairness, intelligence, curiosity, kindness, courage, hope. . . . This is who you will discover in White Picket Fences.
Patricia RaybonAuthor of My First White Friend: Confessions on Race, Love and Forgiveness
A writer of beauty, bravery, and compassion.
Rachel SimonAuthor of The Story of Beautiful Girl
A Princeton grad, Amy Julia is as sharp as a tack but she also writes with power, emotion and careful theological reflection.
Sharon Hodde MillerAuthor of Nice: Why We Love to be Liked
Amy Julia Becker allows us to enter an important—but not easy—spiritual journey of awakening
and enlightenment.
