Story
Help Sundered Vale's aid worker. (Designer: Dras)
===NEWS FLASH===NEWS FLASH===NEWS FLASH===NEWS FLASH===NEWS FLASH===
Residents of Aylor were awoken late last night to a rumbling from the sky,
but this was no ordinary thunderstorm rolling through!  The whole sky lit
up, in what members of the Vampire community are calling "The brightest
night in our long and spooky memories."  An outspoken leader of the Dwarf
community had this to report: "I was working on a tunnel and there was all
of a sudden this shaking and I thought I was a goner for sure!  But then it
stopped, and I came up to see if anyone else had noticed, but everyone was
just pointing to the south, spouting some nonsense about a ball of fire and
smoke."  We'll keep you up to date as we learn more.
Goals.
An aid worker has traveled from Aylor to the Vale to help out. Unfortunately,
she doesn't seem to be able to find her way through the destruction. Travel
to the Sundered Vale and see if you can help.
Level Range         : 5 to 20
Goal Difficulty     : Easy
Goal Recommended at : Level 5
