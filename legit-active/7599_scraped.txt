WHAT OUR FRIENDS SAY
My wife and I stayed in a different place than my boys who came to play a tournament. The tournament took place very close to our hotel so we used to go there by bicycle and we watched the boys‚Äô games with pleasure.
In my opinion, the boys had a great time and were very happy: two groups played in one tournament (U11). The boys of 2006 were third and those of the year 2007 were in fifth place.
We have impressed our German rivals; We will hope to continue the tradition and participate in the next tournaments!
