The
Significance of the Battle of the Little Bighorn
The
Battle of the Little Bighorn was the most successful action
fought by the American Indians against the United States
Army in the West. It was part of the Campaign of 1876,
an effort by the United States Government to force the
Sioux tribes onto their Reservations. The Indians' defeat
of the finest cavalry unit in the United States Army had
the same shocking effect then as the Challenger
explosion had on the nation in 1986. It simply was not
supposed to happen.
The
events surrounding the Battle of the Little Bighorn
have fascinated amateur and professional historians
for 130 years, principally because of its many mysteries.
While we will never know exactly what happened at
"Custer's Last Stand," there is more than
enough information for conjecture and debate. In fact,
this intriguing battle has been the subject of countless
books, articles, movies, television programs, poems,
songs, and websites. The National Park Service's guidebook, Custer Battlefield, provides an excellent
overview of the events leading up to and including
the battle and its aftermath. Click

It
is hoped that this website will be a portal of exploration
for groups and individuals who share an interest in the
Battle of the Little Bighorn. I welcome all information
concerning books, conferences, and anything else related
to the period. This website will always be a work in progress,
so I invite you to visit often!
