The 38-year-old Hartman, playing in his MLS-record 400th career game, helped the club avoid a loss but it still extended a franchise-record winless streak to 12 matches (0-8-4)."It's obviously a pretty big accomplishment for me," Hartman said of the milestone."When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was play soccer a lot, play professionally, so to play 400 league games means a lot to me. I thought we did everything we needed to get the three points. It was disappointing.""I thought we gave everything we possibly had to in the game," said Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman. "It's not what we wanted but it wasn't through a lack of effort on their part."Danny Koevermans tied it for Toronto (2-10-4) in the 31st minute with his ninth of the season."I can't speak highly enough of my boys, taking the game to Dallas in the second half," said Toronto coach Paul Mariner, whose squad is unbeaten (1-0-4) in their past five. "I thought maybe we didn't get off to the greatest start but we fought back well.""It was perfect. They had us 1-0 and we had to fight back and we did it," said Koevermans, who has scored in five straight games. "We got some chances, so I think a draw is a good result for us."David Ferreira, who won the 2010 MLS MVP award and led Dallas to that year's MLS Cup final, returned after a 14-month absence following a broken ankle in April 2011 that required multiple surgeries. The 32-year-old Ferreira entered the match as a substitute in the 57th minute."I think having David back, you could tell the way that he kind of orchestrates our entire attack," Hartman said. "Tonight, he showed that. I think seeing things like that really excite us, having a guy like that back.""When I saw David on the bench, I knew what was coming," Mariner added. "Really, really pleased to see David back. He's a very special player in this league. No one wants to see great players away from their team."Dallas nearly regained the lead in the 33rd minute, but Toronto goalkeeper Milos Kocic got a hand on Fabian Castillo's 15-yard blast, deflecting it just enough for it to slam off the crossbar.Toronto's best chance for a late game-winner came in the 84th minute when Torsten Frings' corner kick sailed into the penalty area for a header by Koevermans that forced Hartman to make the best of his three saves on the night."So close, great save from Hartman," Koevermans said. "I thought it was going in the moment I hit it, I thought, 'This is the winner,' but it was a fantastic save.""Fortunately I was able to get a good read on it and get a good push and turn it away," Hartman said. "It felt good to get a big save and keep us with a point and keep us going in the right direction."
