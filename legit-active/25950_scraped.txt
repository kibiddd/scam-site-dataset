Her ferocious embodiment of teenage misfit Pauline Parker - whose impassioned rapport with her only friend (a pre-fame Kate Winslet) spiralled perilously out of control in 1950s Christchurch - was deemed "perfect" by TIME's Richard Corliss and won the debuting New Zealander a Best Actress trophy in her motherland.In the wake of a prolonged sabbatical - spent studying at university and relocating to Los Angeles - Lynskey resurfaced on the silver screen when she was cast as the refreshingly kind stepsister of Drew Barrymore in Ever After (1998), a girl-power twist on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. A steady mixture of teen movies and romcoms - Detroit Rock City (1999), But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), Coyote Ugly (2000), Abandon (2002), Sweet Home Alabama (2002) - came next, as did more serious fare such as Snakeskin (2001), Shattered Glass (2003), and the Clint Eastwood war epic Flags of Our Fathers (2006).Starting with an esteemed quartet of supporting parts in the late 2000s - Sam Mendes's Away We Go (2009), Jason Reitman's Up in the Air (2009), Steven Soderbergh's The Informant! (2009), Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass (2009) - and continuing with vital appearances in Win Win (2011), The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), and Adam McKay's Don't Look Up (2021), Lynskey has emerged as one of the most distinctive and lauded actresses of her generation; a niche that was solidified by top-billed roles in a slew of exemplary indies: Hello I Must Be Going (2012), Happy Christmas (2014), The Intervention (2016) - for which she scored a Special Jury Prize at Sundance - and the genre-bending pulp jewel, I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore (2017).Since entering the annals of 21st century pop culture with her riotous portrait of Rose - on the toweringly successful Two and a Half Men (2003), where she appeared for over a decade as Charlie Sheen's duplicitous admirer - Lynskey has injected her scene-stealing prowess into a multitude of small-screen gigs: among them, HBO's exalted tragicomedy Togetherness (2015), which showcased her "sublime, deeply felt" (Vanity Fair) depiction of a dissatisfied stay-at-home mom; macabre Stephen King spookfest Castle Rock (2018), where she headlined as pill-popping psychic Molly Strand; and the all-star political period piece Mrs. America (2020), in which she joined forces with Cate Blanchett.For her valiant work on Showtime's Yellowjackets (2021) - where she's front-and-centre as Shauna, a crazed housewife consumed by horrific secrets - Lynskey collected the coveted Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series (2022), with Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall describing her performance in the runaway cult smash as the "dark, messy, charismatic part she's been waiting her whole career to play". Further still, her innate flair for dismantling surface-level sweetness was brought thrillingly to the fore by acclaimed turns in Hulu's Candy (2022) - as troubled real-life murder victim Betty Gore - and mega-budgeted zombie saga The Last of Us (2023), where she guested as a cold-blooded war criminal.BornMay 16, 1977More at IMDbProContact infoAgent infoResumeBornMay 16, 1977IMDbProStarmeterTop 50020Add to listView contact info at IMDbPro

thing was to go back to school. It's a pretty catty environment at an
all-girls school and things happened. For example,
60 Minutes (1993) came to do a story on me and followed me
around for a day. At school you just don't need that. And then I would
have to go to New York or Sydney for a week and take time out. And
while they were amazing experiences, it was hard because I had these
two completely separate lives. I think a lot of people resented that.
It put me outside of them a bit.TrademarkKnown for playing soft-spoken women with a dark side.NicknameMelFAQ11Powered by AlexaHow old is Melanie Lynskey?When was Melanie Lynskey born?Where was Melanie Lynskey born?Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentLearn more about contributingEdit page
