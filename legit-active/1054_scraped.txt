NYC - AMNH: Harry Frank Guggenheim Hall of Minerals - Azurite/Malachite ore
Minerals and gems have been part of the Museum since it opened in 1869. The AMNH purchased its first major mineral collection in 1874 from S.C.H. Bailey, a New York lawyer. Bailey's collection, numbering between 5,000 and 7,000 specimens, was displayed in the Old Arsenal Building at 64th St. and Fifth Avenue.  In 1901 J.P. Morgan paid $100,000 for the extraordinary 12,300-specimen collection of Clarence S. Bement, a Philadelphia industrialist. Minerals were Bement's abiding passion. He always desired to own the very best specimens, and to this end he was eminently successful.  In 1930, William Boyce Thompson, founder of the Newmont Mining corporation, willed his extensive collection of minerals and gemstone carvings to the AMNH. For over 200 years, Columbia University acquired specimens to produce one of the finest systematic mineral collections. In 1980, Columbia's Department of Geology sold 40,000 of these specimens to the AMNH.  Today the Museum owns over 100,000 mineral specimens, with a few thousand on display in the Guggenheim Hall of Minerals, which was renovated in 1976, along with the Morgan Memorial Hall of Gems, to simulate the interior of a cave. At the center of the Hall in a circular display stands a 4.5 ton pillar of azurite/malachite ore extracted from the Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee, Arizona around the turn of the century and donated to the museum by the Phelps Dodge Corporation. The block contains roughly a ton of copper and was called the "Singing Stone" in the days before the Hall had adequate climate control--changes in humidity caused portions to vibrate and "sing".
