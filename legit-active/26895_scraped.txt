Fred Van Eps
Fred Van Eps (December 30, 1878 – November 22, 1960) was a noted banjoist and banjo maker. The "Van Eps Recording Banjo" was a well-known model until 1930.
Biography
Van Eps was born in Somerville, New Jersey and moved with his family to Plainfield, New Jersey in 1892. He learned to play the banjo and studied the phonograph cylinder recordings of Vess Ossman. In 1897 Van Eps was hired by Thomas Edison's National Phonograph Company in West Orange, New Jersey, working as a regular in studio engagements. Van Eps cylinder recordings, often remakes of Ossman tunes, sold well for Edison. Early ragtime banjo recordings by Van Eps included "A Bunch of Rags" (1900) and "A Ragtime Episode" (1902). He also recorded for a number of other companies, including Columbia (from 1904) and Victor (from 1910).
His group the Van Eps Trio recorded steadily from 1912 to 1922. He also led other groups such as the Van Eps Quartet, the Van Eps Specialty Four, and the Van Eps Banjo Orchestra. In 1914, the latter group was one of the first to record for the American branch of the French Pathé Frères Company. In 1921, Orlando Kellum, inventor of the Photokinema sound-on-disc sound film system, filmed the Van Eps Trio in The Famous Van Eps Trio in a Bit of Jazz.

Van Eps burns up the rug on this one. I chose some surreal, fantastic images to accompany it, but only because I sometimes see those kinds of things when listening. Van Ep's playing here is lively, and seems to have a little bit of the fantastic itself. It also mimicks a shamisen at various points, as you'll see.

Van Eps burns up the rug on this one. I chose some surreal, fantastic images to accompany it, but only because I sometimes see those kinds of things when listening. Van Ep's playing here is lively, and seems to have a little bit of the fantastic itself. It also mimicks a shamisen at various points, as you'll see.
Images are: Van Eps in studio, Felice Beato photochroms from the 1860's, Jean Coulon, Jose Hernandez, Martin Wittfooth, Max Ernst, and Naomi Chen.

Biography
Van Eps was born in Somerville, New Jersey and moved with his family to Plainfield, New Jersey in 1892. He learned to play the banjo and studied the phonograph cylinder recordings of Vess Ossman. In 1897 Van Eps was hired by Thomas Edison's National Phonograph Company in West Orange, New Jersey, working as a regular in studio engagements. Van Eps cylinder recordings, often remakes of Ossman tunes, sold well for Edison. Early ragtime banjo recordings by Van Eps included "A Bunch of Rags" (1900) and "A Ragtime Episode" (1902). He also recorded for a number of other companies, including Columbia (from 1904) and Victor (from 1910).
His group the Van Eps Trio recorded steadily from 1912 to 1922. He also led other groups such as the Van Eps Quartet, the Van Eps Specialty Four, and the Van Eps Banjo Orchestra. In 1914, the latter group was one of the first to record for the American branch of the French Pathé Frères Company.
