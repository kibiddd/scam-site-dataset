As the largest city in Kentucky, Louisville is also home to a quarter of a million citizens, making for a lively arts, culinary and music scene, with just a touch of Southern hospitality. The biggest attractions in Louisville are the horse races at Churchill Downs, culminating with the Kentucky Derby in May. But others come to take in the sports history, or wander the shopping district and enjoy the architecture in Old Louisville and the Highlands. Downtown Louisville offers many art galleries, coffee houses, and eateries, and the city’s many parks offer abundant beauty year round, from Tyler Park in the Highlands to Waterfront Park along the Ohio River. Whether you’re a sports fan come to visit the Louisville Slugger Museum or looking to take in the architecture of Old Louisville, Metropolitan Shuttle can help your group rent a bus in Louisville and travel in comfort and safety. We offer vehicles from small shuttle vans to forty-person party buses, and everything in between. If you’re planning a trip to Louisville, we’re here to make it easier. Here’s a closer look at some of Louisville’s more memorable attractions. Louisville Mega Cavern A former limestone mine, the Mega Cavern is actually classified as a building. At four million square feet, it’s the largest building in Louisville. Because of its size, it’s housed several businesses, been used for storage and recycling and offers zipline and tram tours, as well as an underground mountain bike park. Visitors can bike over twelve miles of trail, catering to riders of every skill level. A trip to the Mega Cavern could well be an all-day adventure, perfect for booking a party bus rental in Louisville and bringing twenty of your closest friends. Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory Baseball history enthusiasts will find plenty to be excited about at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory, located in downtown Louisville’s “Museum Row.” The museum not only showcases the history of the famous baseball bats, but lets visitors touch a piece of baseball history by holding an actual bat used by Mickey Mantle or Johnny Bench. There’s also a pitching simulator, a gallery of statues, and a “Feel the Heat” exhibit where guests can find out what it’s like to face a 90 mph fastball. Those looking to get a glimpse at how the bats are made can take a tour of the attached Louisville Slugger bat factory. Louisville Zoo Educators and parents can plan a school bus rental in Louisville and head to the “State Zoo of Kentucky,” home to over 1,700 animals. The Louisville Zoo features lowland gorillas, pygmy hippopotamus, a rare white American alligator, vampire bats, Panamanian golden frogs, Sumatran tigers, rockhopper penguins, Komodo dragons, and more. In its effort to educate the public about the animals it houses, the zoo has classrooms, party rooms, and viewing areas available for rental, as well as an auditorium where outdoor demonstrations are often held. Kentucky Derby Museum While you’re playing the ponies at Churchill Downs, stop by the Kentucky Derby Museum, where you can learn all about the process of breeding and training a thoroughbred race horse. The museum features a 360-degree theater that shows HD videos related to horse racing, while other exhibits showcase trainers and jockeys throughout Kentucky Derby history.
