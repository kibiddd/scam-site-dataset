Toro y Moi) [Official Video](I Don't Need A) New Girl - Chromeo [Official Music Video]Chromeo - When The Night Falls (feat. Solange Knowles) [Official Video]AboutChromeo, the funk-electronic DJ duo composed of David "Dave 1" Macklovitch and Patrick "P-Thugg" Gemayel, have been churning out catchy dancefloor additions since forming in 2002. Beginning as high school bandmates in Montreal, Canada, the pair combined their appreciation for ‘80s funk, pop and R&B with a mutual studio savvy that leaned more toward hip-hop production. Dave 1 and P-Thugg debuted as Chromeo on 2004’s She’s in Control featuring their first major single “Needy Girl,” followed by Fancy Footwork (2007) and Business Casual (2010). The duo’s 2014 album White Women pushed Chromeo into wider mainstream acclaim, debuting at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 and boasting their single “Jealous (I Ain't with It)," which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart. Chromeo’s 2018 follow-up Head Over Heels added to the duo’s accolades with their first Grammy nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. In 2021, Chromeo showcased their vibrant onstage personas with their first concert album, Date Night: Chromeo Live!To connect with Chromeo:Website // Instagram // YouTube // TikTok // Facebook // Twitter // SpotifyChromeo 2024 Tour Dates:09/05 – Vancouver, BC @ Malkin Bowl09/06 – Carnation, WA @ Remlingner Farms09/07 – Bend, OR @ Hayden Homes Amphitheater09/14 – San Diego, CA @ Petco Park09/16 – Phoenix, AZ @ The Van Buren09/22 – Houston, TX @ White Oak Music Hall Lawn09/29 – Raleigh, NC @ The Ritz10/03 – Washington, DC @ The Anthem10/07 – Montreal, QC @ MTELUS10/09 – Toronto ON @ History10/11 – Royal Oak, MI @ Royal Oak Music Theatre10/12 – Chicago, IL @ Byline Bank Aragon Ballroom10/14 – St. Paul, MN @ Palace Theatre-MN10/15 – Kansas City, MO @ The Midland Theatre - MO10/16 – Omaha, NE @ Steelhouse Omaha10/18 – Denver, CO @ Mission BallroomSetlistsChrome Nights at Steelhouse OmahaOmaha, United StatesWed, Oct 16, 20241.Funklordz Intro (Pitched up from live in New York City version)2.Fancy Footwork3.Juice4.Bonafied Lovin' / BTS5.Must've Been6.Momma's Boy7.Hot Mess8.Replacements9.Night by Night10.Come Alive11.Bad Decision12.Over Your Shoulder13.Old 45's14.Lost and Found15.Jealous (I Ain't With It) (With Funklordz Intro reprised as an outro)Encore16.She Knows It (Personal Effects, Pt. 2)Adult Contemporary at Big Four RoadhouseCalgary, CanadaTue, Jul 9, 20241.Chromeo Intro2.Fancy Footwork3.(I Don't Need A) New Girl4.Tenderoni5.Juice6.Don't Sleep7.Must've Been / Momma's Boy8.Replacements9.Night by Night10.Come Alive11.Over Your Shoulder12.Old 45's13.Lost and Found14.Bonafied Lovin'15.Jealous (I Ain't With It)16.Personal EffectsChromeo at MohawkAustin, United StatesThu, Mar 14, 20241.Ballad of the Insomniacs2.YoYo Disco (Purple Disco Machine Remix) (Wolfram cover)3.Night by Night4.Hot Mess5.Personal Effects6.Needy Girl7.Words With You (Tchami Remix)8.Must've Been9.Tension (Chromeo Remix) (Kylie Minogue cover)10.Juice11.Come Alive12.Fancy Footwork13.Jealous (I Ain't With It) (Solidisco Remix)14.BTSChromeo at Rough Trade NYCNew York, United StatesFri, Feb 16, 20241.Ballad of the Insomniacs2.BTS3.CODA4.Personal Effects5.Tension (Chromeo Remix) (Kylie Minogue cover)6.Words With You (Tchami Remix)7.(I Don't Need A) New Girl8.She Knows It (Personal Effects, Pt. 2)9.10.11.Lost and Found12.Two of Us (Friendsnlovers, Pt. 2)Funk Yourself at Autódromo Hermanos RodríguezMexico City, MexicoSat, Nov 18, 20231.Old 45's2.Juice3.Tenderoni4.Don't Sleep5.Replacements6.Come Alive7.Night by Night8.Over Your Shoulder9.JealousPowered by Setlist.fm(Opens in new tab)More Setlists(Opens in new tab)FAQSWhen did Chromeo go on tour in 2024?Chromeo headed out on the CHROME NIGHTS North American Tour in September 2024.

They play up to the audience and have a great visual show, too.Amazing but shortby Chunk on 10/19/24Steelhouse Omaha - OmahaRating: 4 out of 5Song selection spanned nearly all of their albums and it was a fun time of non stop dancing but they played 15 songs and it lasted only 65 minutes! That's ridiculously short for a headlining band, especially one that has as large of a catalog as them. So that was disappointing. Otherwise great show.Chromeoby Lena on 9/27/24White Oak Music Hall - Downstairs - HoustonRating: 5 out of 5We had never heard of Chromeo, but were invited with friends for a birthday celebration so we bought tickets. They put on a great show!!! Would definitely go see them again.Awful experience at venueby Jace0114 on 9/26/24White Oak Music Hall - Downstairs - HoustonRating: 1 out of 5White Oak Music Hall originally billed the show as being in the outside area, but later moved it inside the smaller building. The room felt way over capacity and we could not see the stage not matter where we moved. We left halfway through the opening act because it was such a miserable concert experience. Never got to see Chromeo.Great Show!by Nicky on 9/25/24White Oak Music Hall - Downstairs - HoustonRating: 5 out of 5The Midnight was great as usual and Chromeo was the best surprise since I had never seen them!  What an amazing show!Sound and quality issuesby Victoria on 9/19/24The Van Buren - PhoenixRating: 4 out of 5Whom ever was in charge of the sound screwed up ALOT at one point pthuggs talk box completely stopped working most of one whole song and intermittently thought out the show , the highs were too high also causing the words try sound unclear there were several technical issues with the synthesizer as well
Whom ever was in charge should not be doing sound for themChrome Nightsby Uncle Dunfy on 9/17/24Petco Park - San DiegoRating: 5 out of 5Flawless performance. You couldn't ask for a more stylish and entertaining act.No-meoby L5 on 9/17/24Petco Park - San DiegoRating: 3 out of 5I think the venue kind of ruined it. It’s a Chromeo show but no one dressed up and it felt like I was on an elementary school play ground with how many kids were there. The way the stage is set up was like it couldn’t get loud enough to be a good show. We left after 20 minutes.AWESOME CONCERTby Tday on 9/12/24Ace of Spades - SacramentoRating: 5 out of 5Great venue and amazing night. Chromeo and the midnight were amazing. Will be back to ace of spadesExcellent showby Kimber S on 9/10/24Hayden Homes Amphitheater - BendRating: 5 out of 5The vibe, the music, the energy were all top tier.
