Couturier-dit-Labonte pioneers
By Janet Manseau October 10, 2009 at 01:07:12
Hi, I am posting the notes that I have for some of my pioneer ancestors, in hopes that they may be of interest to some of you that are doing research on your ancestors.Enjoy, Janet Descendants of Julien Le Couturier Generation No. 1        1.Julien1 Le Couturier was born about 1620 in France.He married Marguerite Pottier.She was born about 1620 in France.         Child of Julien Le Couturier and Marguerite Pottier is: +       2       i.       Gilles2 Couturier-dit-Labonte, born 07 Jan 1640 in Toussaint in Rennes, Brittany, France; died 23 Mar 1726 in St. François du Lac, Yamaska, QC. Generation No. 2        2.Gilles2 Couturier-dit-Labonte (Julien1 Le Couturier) was born 07 Jan 1640 in Toussaint in Rennes, Brittany, France, and died 23 Mar 1726 in St. François du Lac, Yamaska, QC.He married (1) Anne-Elisabeth Detarragon Bef. 17 Mar 1676 in Unknown (presumed Sorel, Richelieu), QC, daughter of Loup DeTarragon and Elizabeth DeMerlin.She was born 14 Feb 1651 in St. Pierre de Trancrainville, Janville, Beauce, France, and died Bef. 05 Oct 1692 in St. Francois du Lac, Québec, Cnada.He married (2) Marie-Jeanne Moral-dit-Cantin 09 Dec 1692 in St. François du Lac, Yamaska, QC (ct 5 Oct, Chambalon), daughter of Quentin Moral-dit-Cantin and Marie LaMarguerite/Marguerie.She was born about 1653 in Unknown, QC, and died 20 Jan 1714 in St. François du Lac, Yamaska, QC. Notes for Gilles Couturier-dit-Labonte: He was born about 1641 in the parish of Toussaint in Rennes, Brittany, though his parents' names are unknown.He arrived in Canada on 15 August 1665 at age 24 as a soldier with the Saurel Company of the Cangnan Regiment and was confirmed at Québec City only nine days later.His nickname "Labonte" was most likely his assigned military name.Labonte translates to "the goodness or kindness". Gilles and Anne-Elisabeth settled at Sorel.In the 1681 census, Gilles and his family were living at Sorel, next to fellow Fille du Roi Catherine de Lalore and her family.Gilles, a cobbler, was recorded as being 39 and his wife was 30. Anne-Elisabeth de Tarragon died after 04 May 1682, On 09 December 1692, Gilles married Jeanne Moral at Saint-François-du-Lac, though he did not have any children with his second wife. Gilles Couturier dit Labonté died 23 March 1726 at Saint-François-du-Lac. Notes for Anne-Elisabeth Detarragon: "King's Daughters", page 218, Anne-Elisabeth de Tarragon was born 14 February 1651 in the parish of Saint-Pierre de Trancrainville in the canton of Janville (near the diocese of Chartres), Beauce (Orléanais). She is the second of seven children of squire Loup de Tarragon, seigneur de la Carrée et d'Auvilliers and Elisabeth de Merlin, who were married 28 November 1648 in Trancrainville. The de Tarragon family is descended from Juan Darragon, aka Jehan Tarragon, a squire "from the country of Spain," whose presence is noted in France as early as 1421. Anne-Elisabeth must have been given an emergency baptism at birth, since she was not baptized by the Church until she was almost two years old, on 03 February 1653. Strangely, her name is omitted in the baptismal notice, and she is only referred to as the daughter of Loup de Tarragon and Elisabeth de Merlin. Anne-Elisabeth's mother died 08 March 1662, when she was only 11 years old. Hubert Charbonneau believes that "it is plausible that at that time she was placed in an institution in Paris, since her father did not remarry until three years later" (he would have done so sooner, with children at home to care for) " [and] Trancrainville is in the middle of Beauce, only a hundred kilometers or so from Paris." Exactly when she came to Canada is not known.It is believed that she came in 1671 at age 20, even though she did not get married until 1676. This scenario is very similar to Jeanne Rigaud, another Fille du Roi, who also arrived in 1671 and married in 1676 at Sorel. A further link between the two is the fact that Anne-Elisabeth served as godmother for Jeanne Rigaud's first child, son Pierre, born 09 March 1677, seven months before Anne-Elisabeth's first child, also named Pierre. As stated above, Anne-Elisabeth did not get married until about 1676. Some time before 19 March 1676, she married Gilles Couturier dit Labonté at Sorel. Though no marriage contract (nor marriage register entry) has been found, it is known that Anne-Elisabeth could sign her name, as attested to by the baptism registers that she signed as a godmother. Anne-Elisabeth de Tarragon died after 04 May 1682, when she served as godmother for Catherine de Lalore's son Gilles. Since she was still old enough to have children of her own and she also served as godmother for eight babies born at Sorel (two children of Catherine de Lalore and two of fellow Fille du Roi Marguerite Andrieu), the fact that the May 1682 mention is the last one for Anne-Elisabeth in the parish register suggests that she died at the end of 1682 or in 1683. In a notarized division of her mother's estate dated 12 February 1685, no mention is made of Anne-Elisabeth (who was referred to in a similar document from 1679), only her younger sister and three surviving brothers. Notes for Marie-Jeanne Moral-dit-Cantin: In the 1666 census, she is listed as being 13 and living asa "pentionnaires" boarder with the Ursulines nuns in Québec City.Parents sometimes boarded their children to keep them safe from Indian attacks. She did not have any children with Gilles Couturier.         Children of Gilles Couturier-dit-Labonte and Anne-Elisabeth Detarragon are: +       3       i.       Pierre3 Couturier-dit-Labonte, born 23 Oct 1677 in Sorel, Richelieu, QC; died 22 Feb 1745 in St. François du Lac, Yamaska, QC. +       4       ii.       Jean-Baptiste Couturier-dit-Labonte, born 28 Aug 1679 in Sorel, Richelieu, QC; died 03 May 1754 in St. François du Lac, Yamaska, QC.        5       iii.       Gilles Couturier-dit-Labonte, born 17 Jul 1681 in Sorel, Richelieu, QC.

Notes for Denis-Joseph Levasseur-dit-Lesperance: Like his father and grandfather, Denis-Joseph was a carpenter. However, since business was not very good in Québec, he moved to Trois Rivières where his brother was a priest. He married Jeanne-Charlotte Couturier from Saint-François-du-Lac on February 4, 1738. Together they had nine children. Denis-Joseph realizing that his trade as a carpenter was not as rewarding as in his first years in Trois- Rivières, encouraged his children to become farmers. One of his boys, Joseph settled in Bécancour; François went to Saint-Angèle de Laval across the St. Lawrence River from Trois Rivières and Jean-Baptiste settled in St. Grégoire.
