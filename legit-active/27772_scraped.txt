What They Say
The owner was very nice worked with me on an issue that I was convinced would not get resolved but he resolved it and I’m very satisfied with his professionalism. My only complaint is now with the girl that claims she is only the answering service and knows nothing about ideal towing. She is a complete idiot. I would highly recommend firing her and hiring someone that knows how to talk to people.
Vica Nova
I called a bunch of tow companies to get my vehicle out of a parking garage downtown. 1st one said $250, 2nd one said $150....for a tow that 1.3 miles. Called around to a few more and found Ideal. I will always use them and recommend them since a bunch of friends / coworkers have had the same issue. Jovanny was nice, carried my car with care, and the shop even said he was one of the better guys to work with.
Kris
It's a towing company so the low star reviews don't do this company justice. I have used this company at all my properties  for the past 10+ years. Matt has always assisted with all my towing needs immediately and in a "Matt" professional maner. Anyone that knows him knows what this means. Thanks for everything guys!!
