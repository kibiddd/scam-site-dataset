Payments may be remitted in one of three ways:
•    Called in and applied to a Visa, Mastercard, or Discover card
•    Left out on the property for the technician to pick up
•    Mailed in – Termite Inspections are exempt from Mail-In payments
Unfortunately, our technicians will be unable to receive payment by knocking on the door as to limit physical contact, as per CDC guidelines, they will slip your invoice into your door for this reason as well. We understand that, upon the shutdown, many of our existing clients were put out of work and may have some struggles financially. If this is the case, and you are concerned about your pest control service, please notify our office and we will do anything we can to assist you with your pest control during this time.
