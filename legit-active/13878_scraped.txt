Football Betting & NFP
Launched in 2006, NationalFootballPost.com has long served the American football fan’s need for breaking news and meaningful analysis of the NFL and college football. Since that time, it has gone through several owners, several business cases but always with the goal of being the definitive source of NFL news and football betting information.
All these changes since 2006 have been for the better and now we are changing again – also for the better. And this time with the ‘bettor’ firmly in mind. National Football Post aims to become the best resource – the Wall Street Journal for football betting – for football betting regulation efforts and for providing honest, experienced reviews of the best US sportsbooks for football bettors.
We bring decades of experience in the NFL wagering environment, in Vegas, from overseas and increasingly from right here in the USA where states have been adopting legal NFL betting since 2018. Fresh young faces on the writing and social media teams mesh with experienced veterans of the sports betting space in Canada and the United States to bring a unique approach.
So, whether its breaking tweets of hot prop odds, updates on legislative efforts in your state to expand mobile betting or the best picks from our experts – and their colleagues on other sites – you will find it here on NationalFootballPost.com
