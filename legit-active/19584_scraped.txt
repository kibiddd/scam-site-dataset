AIDS Wolf plays a noise-rock variant in the grand tradition of Miami's own Harry Pussy. That is, a blasting mix of guitar and drums that rocks as hard as it rumbles your eardrums.
When you're dealing with hippies, it's free rock. And when you're dealing with art-damaged drug addicts, it's no-wave. But whatever the hell you want to call it, AIDS Wolf will do it this Thursday at Miami's unwashed ground zero for noise, Churchill's Pub.
Played at the correct volume, AIDS Wolf will drive your pets and parents equally crazy. But your skeezy Uncle? He'll probably love it. Of course, we don't know how Uncle Skeez will feel about opening act Last. The one-man power electronics technician has been known to peel paint from walls with his clobbering, chaotic volume. But we're sure of one thing: True AIDS Wolf fans will gobble it right up.
