Love, Mom CTaryn DavisDecember 8, 2008I can't believe you're actually gone, that was definitely some hard news to take in.  You have left us with some great memories and I'm so happy i was able to call you my friend.  We would fight then make up, fight again and then laugh about it  in the end.  It means so much to me that we stayed connected..... I will miss you! Love, Tarynwilliam mcdougallDecember 7, 2008i am so sorryto here of your loss. please let jessica know.   love, billy & tesie.Rhonda CDecember 3, 2008To my dearest family, some things I'd like to say...but first of all, to let you know, that I arrived okay.I'm writing this from heaven. Here I dwell with God above.Here, there's no more tears of sadness; here is just eternal love. Please do not be unhappy just because I'm out of sight. Remember that I'm with you every morning, noon and night. That day I had to leave you when my life on earth was through, God picked me up and hugged me and He said, "I welcome you." It's good to have you back again; you were missed while you were gone.As for your dearest family, they'll be here later on.I need you here badly; you're part of my plan.There's so much that we have to do, to help our mortal man. God gave me a list of things, that he wished for me to do.And foremost on the list, was to watch and care for you.And when you lie in bed at night, the day's chores put to flight.God and I are closest to you....in the middle of the night.When you think of my life on earth, and all those loving yearsbecause you are only human, they are bound to bring you tears.But do not 	be afraid to cry; it does relieve the pain.Remember there would be no flowers, unless there was some rain.I wish that I could tell you all that God has planned.But if I were to tell you, you wouldn't understand.But one thing is for certain, though my life on earth is o'er.I'm closer to you now, than I ever was before.There are many rocky roads ahead of you and many hills to climb;but together we can do it by taking one day at a time.It was always my philosophy and I'd like it for you too...that as you give unto the world, the world will give to you.If you can help somebody who's in sorrow and pain,then you can say to God at night......"My day was not in vain."And now I am contented....that my life has been worthwhile,knowing as I passed along the way, I made somebody smile.So if you meet somebody who is sad and feeling low,just lend a hand to pick him up, as on your way you go.When you're walking down the street, and you've got me on your mind;I'm walking in your footsteps only half a step behind.And when it's time for you to go.... from that body to be free,remember you're not going.....you're coming here to me.

I AM SO THANKFUL THAT WE  STAYED IN TOUCH OVER THE YEARS, WE WERE BEST FRIENDS. I WILL MISS OUR PHONE CONVERSATIONS. THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE WAS OCT 23RD. I WISHED I COULD TURN BACK TIME. TO THAT DAY AGAIN.  THE NEWS OF YOUR LEAVING THIS WORLD HAS HIT ME HARD.  I REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED (you were a happy man & proud) AND CALLED ME TO COME TO THE WEDDING, I WISHED I WOULD HAVE WENT.

How bittersweet. Watched the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade with Taylor. Oh how she loved it! Especially Kermit and SANTA!! The turkey is almost done. I will miss your famous,  pecan and marshmallow sweet potatoes. My greatest Thanksgiving ever that I remember was 4 years ago today. You got down on one knee, while we gathered at my home, and asked Jess to marry you. We were all so happy! We all had tears of happiness. Last year was sad because Ed and I were in R.I because my Dad had passed suddenly. We went to my Dads grave and Eds parents grave, just before our flight back home. When we arrived you and Jessica  had Thanksgiving Dinner all ready and the day ended with a great dinner.  In your memory we will give thanks today for your greatest gift to us. The last 6 years you have been in our family have been our happiest and we have Taylor. We will cherish and love her every minute. Thanks Jim for such happy memories. Happy Thanksgiving. We will always love and miss you! Mom and Dad CLink CarneyNovember 27, 2008Iam honestly at a loss for words. How could i ever forget all the moments and craziness we shared growing up.

Your wife and daughter will remain in my thoughts and prayers as well as the rest of your family and friends. God Bless!!!Wayne & Amy HurdNovember 21, 2008To the entire Hume family, our thoughts and prayers are with you during this time of tragic loss.  Though I probably haven't seen Jimmy since 1990, I've got a tremendous number of memories of him as we grew up together on Nelson & Elizabeth Streets in Milford.  My brother Bob and I hung out together with Jimmy and Dave almost everyday for about 8 years playing countless wiffleball games, tag team wrestling, football, walking to/from school and to Medd's Market, playing hide & seek, etc.  He was a great friend and we will miss him dearly.  I know that there are no words that can be spoken or written to express the loss that you are feeling, but we simply wish to let you know that we love you and that we are praying for your healing.  We pray that God will comfort your family during this time.From Psalm 23, verse 4, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, they rod and thy staff, they comfort me.With deepest sympathy,Wayne & Amy HurdRachel WatsonNovember 21, 2008Jimmy, to a great and funny guy I will never ever forget.
