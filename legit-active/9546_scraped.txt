NFL 2002 Kickoff Weekend
PRESIDENT BUSH TO DELIVER TV MESSAGE FOR SUNDAYS KICKOFF
The 2002 NFL season kicks off tonight with the leagues first-ever midweek national TV opener when the San Francisco
49ers visit the New York Giants on ESPN at 8:30 PM ET.
The game will be preceded by NFL KICKOFF LIVE FROM
TIMES SQUARE, presented by New York City and the
NFL. The
event will be an unprecedented football and music festival that will
honor
the resilient spirit of New York and America. Performing in Times
Square
will be BON JOVI, ENRIQUE IGLESIAS, and EVE with
special guest ALICIA KEYS. Bon Jovi will then helicopter
to Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey where they will perform at
halftime,
with ESPN covering live.
Fans throughout the nation will be able to see/hear
portions of the Times Square festival on ESPN, VH1 and Westwood One
Radio.
CBS-TV will broadcast a one-hour primetime special on the event on
Friday at
10:00 PM ET.
On Sunday, before 10 1:00 PM ET games, CBS and FOX
will play a message of greeting by PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH that
will
also be shown in all stadiums. The message will be followed by a
nationally
televised rendition of America the Beautiful performed by the U.S.
Marine
Corps Band.
Also on Sunday, all NFL sideline personnel will wear
clothing emblazoned with the American flag and a 9/11 patch.
Players and
personnel on the Giants and New York Jets will wear caps with the
initials/logos of the New York City Fire, Police and Port Authority
Departments. Washington Redskins players/personnel will wear caps
with the
Pentagon logo.
The ball is the same shape and color.
But it seems that just about everything else about the NFL
in 2002 -- which kicks off its season this Thursday night -- is new.
A new way to begin the season (see above) a new divisional
alignment a new scheduling formula a new team new stadiums new
uniforms JOHN
MADDEN on Monday Night Football and perhaps a new all-time
rushing champion.
And come January, if the recent past is any indication,
perhaps a new Super Bowl champion. For who knows better than the
reigning
champ, the NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, how unpredictable -- and
shocking --
the NFL can be. The past three Super Bowl champions have been
new. They
didnt even make the playoffs the year before. And 83 percent (25
of 30) of
division winners over the past five years also have been new.
Its a new year, says Patriots head coach BILL
BELICHICK, who saw his team go from last in its division in 2000
and an
0-2 and 1-3 start in 2001 to the NFL title. Each team has its
own
chemistry every year. Its not something that a coach or anyone
else can
manipulate. It happens on its own and it works itself out,
sometimes
through circumstances, sometimes through personalities, or sometimes
with
events that happen with the team.
That NFL chemistry will start bubbling with the addition of
the leagues 32nd team, the HOUSTON TEXANS, which necessitated
the
leagues first realignment since 1970. The NFL is now divided
into two
conferences of four four-team divisions each (East, North, South and
West).
The realignment, in turn, produced a new scheduling formula
that guarantees for the first time that all teams will play each other
on a
regular, rotating basis. So the JOHN ELWAY-playing-DAN
MARINO-only-twice-in-their-careers
scenario is a thing of the past.
When the Texans play their first game on Sunday night
(ESPN, 8:30 PM ET) against their first arch enemy -- the cross-state
Dallas
Cowboys -- it will be the first NFL regular-season game in Houston
since
December 15, 1996 (Bengals 21, Oilers 13) -- a span of 2,093 days.
With a
wait like that, no wonder NFL-starved Houstonians bought out all
remaining
tickets to Sunday nights opener in less than 20 minutes this past July
13.
And no wonder when the Texans opened their new 69,500-seat Reliant
Stadium --
the leagues only retractable-roof stadium -- for their first home
preseason
game on August 24, the largest non-Super Bowl crowd (69,432) ever to
watch a
game in Houston showed up.
This kind of reaction pumps up the expansion Texans.
Reliant Stadium is the best-kept secret in football, but
it wont be for long, says Texans running back JAMES
ALLEN.
Eventually, this is going to be a tough place for a visiting team to
come
in and play. This house is built, baby!  Its up to us
now.
Three other teams have built houses this year too. The
Detroit Lions open 65,000-seat FORD FIELD in downtown
Detroit. The
NFC Seattle Seahawks -- the lone team to switch conferences in
realignment
(they actually began as an NFC team in 1976) -- unveil 67,000-seat
SEAHAWKS STADIUM that features views of the Seattle skyline, the
Cascades, Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains.
The Patriots begin defense of their Super Bowl crown in the
first Monday night game of the season (ABC, 9:00 PM ET) at their new
68,000-seat GILLETTE STADIUM that features a 10-story New
England
lighthouse above its north end zone. They take on the Pittsburgh
Steelers
in a rematch of last seasons AFC Championship Game.
It will be the first time since 1991 that the participants
of a preceding seasons conference championship game face each other in
the
next seasons Monday night opener. On September 2, 1991, the
Super Bowl
XXV-champion Giants defeated the team they topped in the 1990 NFC
Championship Game, the visiting 49ers, 16-14.
The Monday night opener will be the first in New England
since 1979 when the Patriots lost 16-13 in overtime to the
Steelers. It
also will be the Patriots first Monday night opener since a 27-21 loss
in
Denver in 1998. And it will be the regular-season Monday night
debut of Mr.
Bam! Slam! himself, John Madden.
On Monday night, its the only game, and the players feel
this, says Madden. They know everyone is watching them.
Theres so much
adrenaline.
One player Monday who expects and will enjoy that rush is
New England quarterback TOM BRADY, a perfect example of the
unpredictability of the NFL. A veritable unknown a year ago,
the-then
24-year-old Brady resurrected the Patriots from their 1-3 start and led
them
to their Super Bowl victory while earning himself the games MVP
trophy and
a recently-signed four-year contract extension.
The new contract is great, says Brady, but the key thing is
being on the field. Its going to be incredible Monday night
under the
lights against Pittsburgh, he says. Its about playing
football. Ive
never played this game for anything other than absolutely loving
it.

Monday, September 9
Pittsburgh Steelers at New England Patriots (9:00 PM ET)
The man Tom Brady supplanted in New England, quarterback
DREW BLEDSOE, will wear a new uniform this year -- a new new
uniform -- with the Buffalo Bills.
The Bills, Seahawks and Washington Redskins all will sport
new uniforms this season, with the Redskins actually wearing a 60s
retro
look to celebrate their 70th anniversary.
All three teams hope to duplicate the NFLs recent New
Uniform = Playoffs trend. The past seven teams to redesign their
uniforms
earned playoff berths in the first year of their new look (96 Eagles,
97
Broncos, 97 Buccaneers, 98 Jets, 99 Titans, and the 2000 Giants and
Rams).
And talk about retro.  This year, perhaps the most
hallowed record in NFL annals can be broken by Dallas Cowboys running
back
EMMITT SMITH -- career rushing yards.
The mark is held, of course, by the late WALTER PAYTON,
the Chicago Bears speedster who was enshrined into the Pro Football
Hall of
Fame in 1993. Payton rushed for 16,726 yards from 1975-87.
Smith, who
began in the NFL with the Cowboys in 1990, will break the record with
540
yards.
It is a special opportunity, and I call it an opportunity
because I havent done it yet, says Smith. I still have a long
way to
go.  Smith had a photo of Payton in his high school
locker.
There are other milestones that can be reached by NFL
players in 2002:
·
PACKERS QB BRETT FAVRE can tie Johnny
Unitas,
Len Dawson and Steve Young for most seasons leading the NFL in
touchdown
passes (four).
·
COLTS QB PEYTON MANNING can become the
first
player in history with four consecutive 4,000-yard passing seasons.
·
RAIDERS WR JERRY RICE can become the first
player with 200 career touchdowns; first in all-purpose yards and
scrimmage
yards; first with 1,400 receptions; and first with catches in 250
consecutive games and with 21,000 receiving yards.
·
RAMS RB MARSHALL FAULK can add to his NFL
record
of four consecutive 2,000 scrimmage-yard seasons.
·
JETS RB CURTIS MARTIN can become the second
player in history (Barry Sanders) to rush for 1,000 yards in each of
his
first eight seasons.
·
TITANS DE JEVON KEARSE can become the third
player in history (Reggie White and Derrick Thomas) to record
double-digit
sacks in each of his first four seasons.
Along with those possible records, there are other news
in the NFL this year, and some olds:

So mix in the NFLs new look with your typical on-the-field

right.
Everybody can win, he says.  Everybody has a chance.
Thats the best thing about our sport.
