We love finding new Scripture songs for our family.  Heard you today on FamilyLife Radio.  Thanks for your ministry.
Enjoyed the style you played in the studio today.  Like to tap our toes but can still clearly understand the lyrics.
Also “liked” you on facebook and subscribed to your blog.

My sons were excited when they heard you on the radio. 🙂 They love listening to the  Seeds of faith and Seeds of courage cds and would love to get some more music. I think putting scripture to music is so amazingly powerful! Thanks for what you are doing!

Yes, a great big thank you for this great music that is wonderful for the WHOLE family!  It’s not just music, but SCRIPTURE so intricately woven into our children’s hearts!  This is hard to find and delivered in a fun children’s fashion. Wonderful resource for this homeschooling mama, who too has to choose wisely on a very tight budget.  May God bless this ministry!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! The FamilyLife broadcast was wonderful!  I liked you on Facebook, am on my way to announce this great product there, and have subscribed to your blog.

Heard you on Family Life Today and was encouraged by what you are doing. We have many scripture memory CDs but I think yours is the first I have heard incorporate the verse reference in the song which is great! I can quote many a verse through song but can’t always say where they are found.

Liked you on facebook also.
As for styles of music I tend to not like it too heavy on the beat but concentrate on the words. When I listened to “Do Not Be Anxious” I would have rather had a song that sounded more calming to match the verse.
Keep being a blessing!

I am not sure if you have done the giveaway yet, but I wanted to sign up anyway.  I love Fighter Verse songs.  We have set D.  Do you ever post chords for these songs?  I would love to sing them with my kids and children’s ministry at church.
1. I clicked on like on FB
2. I subscribed to your blog
3. I put a link to this giveaway on my FB
Hope this gets the word out!  Thanks for your ministry.
By the way, I have a friend in the Twin Cities who goes to Bethlehem and is a professional musician and music writer.  Maybe he could get involved.  Feel free to email me if you want more info.  God bless your work.

Good Words  The Scripture songs are a wonderful resource.  My son likes what he calls “the boy song” (salt and light). My daughter loves “Do not give dogs…”.  They both love “No one can serve two masters.”  I encourage everyone to give it a listen.  The biggest thing is that my children love singing God’s word to the music.  May it be forever in their hearts, directing them to Jesus! - Gil McConnell, Pastor for Child and Youth Discipleship
