Smokey Joe's Cafe
Smokey Joe's Cafe is a musical revue showcasing 39 pop standards, including rock and roll and rhythm and blues songs written by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The Original Broadway cast recording, Smokey Joe's Cafe: The Songs Of Leiber And Stoller, won a Grammy award in 1996.
After a Los Angeles tryout, the revue opened on Broadway in 1995, running for 2,036 performances, making it the longest-running musical revue in Broadway history. It also had a London run in 1996.
Synopsis
In revue format with no unifying theme, the 39 songs are presented by various members of the cast in various combinations, with no dialogue. There are novelty songs ("Charlie Brown"), romantic ballads ("Spanish Harlem"), and infectious melodies ("There Goes My Baby").
Songs
Music and lyrics for all songs are by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, unless otherwise noted. The song "Smokey Joe's Cafe" is not performed in the show, although a brief instrumental excerpt is used in Act II as transitional music.

Caledonian Railway 264 Class
The Caledonian Railway 264 and 611 classes were 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotives designed by Dugald Drummond and built by Neilson and Company in 1885. Later examples were built at St. Rollox railway works under the direction of John F. McIntosh in 1895, 1900, 1902 and 1908.
These small shunters remained in long service under the LMS (who designated all Neilson saddle locomotives as Class 0F) and British Railways, with the last of the class withdrawn in 1962. The 0F class, sometimes referred to by the generic term "pugs", were mainly used as works shunters in the area around Glasgow, Scotland, often running with home-made tenders to improve their small coal capacity. Like most 0-4-0 tanks of the period they had outside cylinders and inside slide valves driven by Stephenson valve gear. A number were later sold into private industry and several even made it as far south as Crewe where they acted as works shunters in British Railways days. None of the various 0F class locomotives have survived into preservation.

Fire Truck (video game)
Fire Truck is a black-and-white 1978 arcade game. It was developed and published by Atari, Inc.. According to GamesRadar, it was the earliest video game with cooperative gameplay where two players were forced to work together.
A one-player version of the game, called Smokey Joe was also released. This was internally identical to Fire Truck.
Gameplay
While there is no real "goal" to the game, Fire Truck is considered to be a "racing game" where the two players must cooperate to drive the truck through traffic as far as possible without crashing.  While the game can be played with one player, it was clearly meant to be played with two.  The front player steers the tractor of the truck sitting down, controlling the gas and brakes, while the rear player stands, and steers the tiller for the rear wheels, controlling the swing of the trailer.  The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.

Stand By Me (Ben E King)
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me, yeah
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Darlin', darlin', stand by me, stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

Smokey Joe's Cafe
Smokey Joe's Cafe is a musical revue showcasing 39 pop standards, including rock and roll and rhythm and blues songs written by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The Original Broadway cast recording, Smokey Joe's Cafe: The Songs Of Leiber And Stoller, won a Grammy award in 1996.
After a Los Angeles tryout, the revue opened on Broadway in 1995, running for 2,036 performances, making it the longest-running musical revue in Broadway history. It also had a London run in 1996.
Synopsis
In revue format with no unifying theme, the 39 songs are presented by various members of the cast in various combinations, with no dialogue. There are novelty songs ("Charlie Brown"), romantic ballads ("Spanish Harlem"), and infectious melodies ("There Goes My Baby").
Songs
Music and lyrics for all songs are by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, unless otherwise noted. The song "Smokey Joe's Cafe" is not performed in the show, although a brief instrumental excerpt is used in Act II as transitional music.
