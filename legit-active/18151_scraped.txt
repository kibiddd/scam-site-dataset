About California
California is the 31st state of the United States, which was admitted to the union on September 9, 1850. Sacramento is California’s capital city. While Los Angeles is the largest city in California, Greater Los Angeles is the most extensive metro/urban area. English and Spanish are the major spoken languages. In the US, California is the most populous state. While Golden State is its nickname, “Eureka” is the State Motto. Learn more about this US state from Key Facts of California.
California Flag
California’s state flag has a white background with a red stripe spanning the fly’s length. At the flag’s center, it features a brown grizzly bear walking on a green grass patch. “California Republic” is inscribed below the bear. You’ll find a five-pointed red star at the flag’s upper left corner.
The flag originated in 1846 with the Bear Flag Revolt against Mexico. Peter Storm and William L. Todd designed the bear flags at that time. However, in 1906, the Bear Flag of Todd was destroyed during an earthquake. That’s when a new version was created. On February 3, 1911, California officially adopted this state map. Based on a watercolor painting of a bear by painter Charles Christian Nahl, the California flag was standardized in 1953.
California State Symbols
In 1849, the California state Constitutional Convention adopted the “Great Seal of the State of California.” Though minor changes were made over time, the design was finally standardized in 1937.
The Great Seal of the State of California consists of Athena (of Greek mythology) or Roman Goddess Minerva overseeing the works of a miner. A bear (the state animal of California) stands at the feet of the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. The seal also shows Nevada mountains in the background and ships plying in the river below the mountain.
“Eureka” is written at the top of the image, in the portion that shows the sky over the mountains. This is a Greek word that means “I have found it.” It refers to the gold discovery in the state, which led to the flourishing economy of California. The seal also shows a pan and a rocker near the gold miner. The gold miners used the pan to find gold from the dirt. The rocker is a larger-sized pan that helps miners to find more gold from dirt faster.
“The Great Seal of the State of California” and “California” are written over a yellow-colored ring surrounding the image (described above in the seal).
California History
The early history of California dates back to 10,000 years back. This Native American history continued till 1542. The latter part can be divided into four parts:

During the American Civil War, California has seen multiple wars. Some of the major ones are:
Snake War
Bald Hills War
Owens Valley Indian War
Battle of Cedar Creek
Chiricahua Wars
Third Battle of Winchester
Carson’s campaign against the Navajo
California became the 31st state to be admitted to the Union on September 9, 1850.
