Descendants of John McLeod of Lot 37
Generation No. 1
1. JOHN2 MCLEOD (ALEXANDER1) was
born in the late 1790's in Nova Scotia, Canada (or Scotland?), and died Abt.
1879 in PEI, Canada. He married MARY MACKINNON Abt. 1834 in PEI, Canada, daughter
of JOHN MACKINNON and UNKNOWN MCRAE. She was born Abt. 1818 in PEI, and died
Abt. 1880 in PEI, Canada.
Notes for JOHN MCLEOD:
Believed to have resettled on PEI from Nova Scotia. No John McLeod ancestors
have been found prior to the 1830's on PEI. Family stories say John came from
Nova Scotia. His father, possibly a John McLeod, was alleged to have been killed
by a bear after arriving on PEI. Research is ongoing.
Notes for MARY MACKINNON:
Mary McKinnon's father was John McKinnon of Pisquid. There is a John McKinnon
shown in the 1841 census of Lot 37. But, it is not known if this is the John
McKinnon in question. However, it is a good possibility. The 1841 Census for
John McKinnon shows an adult male and female both upwards of sixty. One of whom
was born in Scotland. That could be John or his wife.
