Ryan
This animated short from Chris Landreth is based on the life of Ryan Larkin, a Canadian animator who produced some of the most influential animated films of his time. Ryan is living every artist's worst nightmare - succumbing to addiction, panhandling on the streets to make ends meet. Through computer-generated characters, Landreth interviews his friend to shed light on his downward spiral. Some strong language. Viewer discretion is advised.

Investigate the effects of success. How was Ryan pressured to perform? How did this affect his ability to make his art? Students can reflect on situations where they feel pressure and how it affects their decisions and sense of well-being. Why did Ryan turn to substance abuse? Why doesn’t he accept help to get a job and get off the streets? Ask students whether seeing this film has changed their impressions of homelessness.
