Innovation isn't just my profession—it's my life's purpose. Through three decades of driving technological breakthroughs, from my role as HP's CTO to leading CableLabs as CEO, I've discovered that true innovation comes from making the complex simple and the impossible achievable.But what really energizes me is helping others unlock their creative potential. Whether through my Killer Innovations podcast (reaching millions since 2005), my YouTube channel, my book Beyond the Obvious, or my work mentoring entrepreneurs and advising Fortune 100 companies, I'm passionate about sharing practical, real-world innovation strategies that actually work.I believe everyone has the capacity to innovate—sometimes, you just need someone who's been there to help you uncover it. That's why I created this space: to share honest insights and proven frameworks that can transform how you approach challenges and opportunities.Ready to begin?
