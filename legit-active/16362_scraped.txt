Soul Summit Music is more than just a DJ collective—it’s a movement. With over 60 years of combined experience, we have shaped the very fabric of nightlife and dance music culture, setting the standard for soulful, high-energy experiences. Rooted in authenticity, passion, and an unwavering commitment to uplifting communities through music, our journey began with a vision: to create spaces where people from all walks of life could come together and celebrate the power of rhythm, connection, and movement.
What started as a local gathering has transformed into a cultural institution. The Soul Summit Music Festival, now a cornerstone of New York City’s nightlife and festival scene, has been drawing thousands of devoted music lovers for over two decades. Our events are more than just parties—they are immersive experiences, blending deep, euphoric sounds with an unmatched atmosphere of unity and joy.
Unlike trends that come and go, Soul Summit Music thrives on authenticity and timeless appeal. Our ability to curate and cultivate energy on the dance floor sets us apart, making every event an unforgettable journey through sound. From sold-out venues to open-air festivals, we continue to push the boundaries of what nightlife can be, ensuring that every beat, every mix, and every moment reflects the soul of the music we love.
With a legacy built on passion and a future fueled by innovation, Soul Summit Music remains a driving force in the evolution of nightlife—where tradition meets transformation, and the dance floor is always alive
