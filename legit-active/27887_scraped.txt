.quebec
.quebec is a new GeoTLD and Community Priority Application that was proposed to ICANN's New gTLD Program by PointQuébec, a non-profit organisation. The organisation aims to improve the businesses, culture, tourism, and online identity of Quebec and the Quebecois through the .quebec TLD. According to the PointQuébec organisation, .quebec will allow all Quebecers to register their domain names under .quebec.
PointQuébec's application for the GeoTLD was approved, and was delegated to the Root Zone on 16 April 2014. The application was supported by the Quebec National Assembly and other cultural, technical, and economic institutions in the city. It received "substantial financial support from the Québec government", and is a not-for profit organisation. The organisation will verify legitimate registrations via statements of intent through a post-verification registration system. quebec officially launched on November 18, 2014.
Along with TLDs such as .cat and .africa, .quebec and other new TLDs fall into the new category of GeoTLDs. The issue of new top level domains in general and .quebec in particular has been discussed at various ICANN-Meetings since 2005.

Quebec
Quebec (i/kwᵻˈbɛk/ or /kəˈbɛk/; French: Québec [kebɛk]) is the second-most populous province in Canada. It is the only Canadian province that has a predominantly French-speaking population, and the only one to have French as its sole provincial official language.
Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay, and Hudson Bay; to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay; to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; it is bordered on the south by the province of New Brunswick and the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia.
Quebec is Canada's second most populous province, after Ontario. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area, including the Island of Montreal. English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Eastern Townships, and Gaspé regions. The Nord-du-Québec region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples. The climate around the major cities is four-season continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions. Even in central Quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are very severe in inland areas.

Quebec (AG) v Canada (AG)
Quebec (AG) v Canada (AG) 2015 SCC 14 is a Canadian constitutional law case concerning the federal government's ability to destroy information related to the Canadian long-gun registry pursuant to the federal criminal law power.
Background
In 1995, Parliament passed the Firearms Act, which required long gun owners to register their guns. The Supreme Court found that the Act was intra vires the federal criminal law power. In 2012, Parliament repealed the requirement to register long guns through the Ending the Long-gun Registry Act (ELRA) and sought to delete the information in its registry. The province of Quebec, wishing to create and maintain its own long gun registry, requested that the federal government share the data it had collected about Quebec long gun owners. When the federal government declined to share the information, Quebec argued that section 29 of the ELRA, the provision disbanding the long gun registry, was ultra vires the federal government.
At trial in the Superior Court of Quebec, the trial judge found that section 29 was unconstitutional as it violated the principle of cooperative federalism given that Quebec had take part in "gathering, analyzing, organizing, and modifying" the data in question. The trial judge required the federal government to share the information with Quebec.

Quebec City | Real 8K
Original content filmed and edited in 8K resolution.
Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

You can buy the packages for shorter trips as well, but they're especially fantastic for digital nomads and nomads who want regular health insurance when they are abroad. I am an affiliate of this company, but of course use the plans myself.

Quebec City is a little taste of Europe in Canada! From its charming cobblestone streets, historic architecture and chic bistros and cafes, you definitely don't feel like you're in Canada any more. Join me as I tour around some of the cities most famous sites like the Old Town, Dufferin Terrace, the Citadelle, Plains of Abraham and of course Petit Quartier Champlain. Of course you most try some REAL maple syrup when visiting Quebec, as well the national dish of poutine! Hope you enjoy the video and visit this amazing city yourself someday!

Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

How Quebec Plans To Save Itself From English
Quebec is the only province in Canada where francophones make up the majority of the population, and for Quebecers, preserving the French language is the only possible safeguard for the survival of the Quebec identity and culture. So in a world where everything is dominated by English-speaking media, this is how Quebec is trying to save their province from anglicisation.

The travel health insurance I use - PassportCard Nomads: https://www.passportcardnomads.com/?ref=alinamcleod
*I highly recommend this travel health insurance because you don't have to pay out of pocket for your medical expenses and they have very reasonably priced long term plans. You can buy the packages for shorter trips as well, but they're especially fantastic for digital nomads and nomads who want regular health insurance when they are abroad. I am an affiliate of this company, but of course use the plans myself.

You don’t need to go all the way to France to say “Bonjour” and nibble on croissants. #Quebec maintains strong ties to its French roots, which date back to 1608. The town’s official language is French and it’s even home to a replica of Norte Dame.
While on #vacation here, mosey around the cafes and shops in North America’s oldest retail district, and #visit the Musee de la Civilisation. Embark on a Quebec City #tour around the colonial buildings in Dufferin Terrace, the history at Battlefields Park, and the stunning beauty of Montmorency Falls. From the Saint Lawrence River to Fontaine de Tourny, there are endless attractions to experience in Quebec’s capital city.
When you’re looking to indulge in a little European flair, without leaving North America, explore Quebec City. To further fuel your adventures, check out our travel guide video and pick up more tips and recommendations.
For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Original content filmed and edited in 8K resolution.
Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

The organisation aims to improve the businesses, culture, tourism, and online identity of Quebec and the Quebecois through the .quebec TLD. According to the PointQuébec organisation, .quebec will allow all Quebecers to register their domain names under .quebec.
PointQuébec's application for the GeoTLD was approved, and was delegated to the Root Zone on 16 April 2014. The application was supported by the Quebec National Assembly and other cultural, technical, and economic institutions in the city. It received "substantial financial support from the Québec government", and is a not-for profit organisation. The organisation will verify legitimate registrations via statements of intent through a post-verification registration system. quebec officially launched on November 18, 2014.
Along with TLDs such as .cat and .africa, .quebec and other new TLDs fall into the new category of GeoTLDs. The issue of new top level domains in general and .quebec in particular has been discussed at various ICANN-Meetings since 2005.

On a free ride home from the embassyI saw the governor and his lover holding handsWhen I got to my place, I emptied my suitcaseAnd opened the windows wideIf you could save yourself, you'd save us allIs that what you called me forIs that why you're knocking on my door?The time I've spent working myself to deathThought that's what you wanted, I thought you needed my helpTo make it good again, to make us strongTo make you happy, to push you alongAnd gain some respect, to be thrown a crumbI was on my knees when you knocked me downThe wheels fell off, the bottom dropped outThe checks all bounced, I came in your mouthYour mother came calling but there was no one aroundThe trash caught fire when the leaves turned brownThe vultures were circling when the circus left townI left you a note but I wrote it in disappearing inkIf you could save yourself, you'd save us allIs that what you called me forIs that why you're knocking on my door?The time I've spent working myself to deathThought that's what you wanted, I thought you needed my helpTo make it good again, to make us strongTo make you happy, to push you alongAnd gain some respect, to be thrown a crumbI was on my knees when you knocked me down
