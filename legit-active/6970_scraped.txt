Both teams played to 0-0 ties, on May 28, in Florida, and June 18, at Saputo Stadium."We are adressing each game and each practice with a new approach," said Impact head coach and sporting director Nick De Santis. "I think that if the team puts the effort and works together, it will lead to winning games. We put a lot of intensity and rhythm through the last eight days, but it's obvious that there are some elements and principles we need to follow to find success. Tomorrow we must play well at home, and in doing that, we will find back the road to victory.""Only hardwork will lead us to do well and to win games," said Impact striker Eduardo Sebrango, who has played the last two games. "It's important for the team morale to get back on a winning streak, especially at home. The whole team has to be more aggressive and involved in the attack. And if we continue to be good defensively everything will go the right way." The Impact has not allowed a goal at Saputo Stadium in the last 309 minutes of play.In its last game, 10 days ago, the Impact was shut out 2-0 against the Carolina RailHawks, at WakeMed Soccer Park, in Cary.Montreal is unbeaten at home against Fort Lauderdale, with a record of three wins and five ties in eight games.The Fort Lauderdale Strikers are currently sixth in the NASL standings with a record of three wins, four losses and eight ties for a total of 17 points.
