Though the band has not released an album since 2011, Puddle of Mudd continues to tour, singing its most popular hits to die-hard, dedicated fans.The band's roots are in Kansas City, Missouri, where they began playing together in 1991. However, their first studio album, Abrasive, was not released until 1997. This album was so limited in its release, though, that many of the songs were re-released on the next album, 2001's Come Clean. Popular singles from this album included "Control," "She Hates Me," "Blurry" and "Drift & Die," which helped Come Clean sell over five million copies and reach No. 9 on the Billboard 200 chart. Their next album was 2003's Life on Display, which reached No. 20 on the Billboard 200 and featured the hits "Away from Me," "Spin You Around" and "Heel Over Head." The 2006 follow-up, Famous, includes hit singles Psycho and the title track. In 2009, Puddle of Mudd released Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love and Hate, an album that featured songs "Stoned" and "Spaceship". In 2011, the band members released a cover album, Re:(disc)overed, and also announced that they were continuing to write more original songs to release in a future album.SetlistsPuddle of Mudd at Coushatta Casino ResortKinder, United StatesSat, Mar 8, 20251.Control2.Out of My Head3.Beautimous (Probably a new song)4.Nothing Left to Lose5.Psycho (With interlude)6.Spin You Around7.Uh Oh8.Blurry9.Spaceship10.Away From Me11.Famous12.Drift & Die13.She Hates Me (Extended version)Puddle of Mudd at The Broken SpokeDaytona Beach, United StatesSat, Mar 1, 20251.Control2.Blurry3.Psycho4.She Hates Me5.Might be a new song, probably "Kiss the Machine" or "Beautiful Disaster"Puddle of Mudd at Rock & BrewsRidgefield, United StatesSat, Feb 22, 20251.Control2.Out of My Head3.Beautiful Disaster (Live Debut, probably a new song)4.Nothing Left to Lose5.Kiss The Machine (Probably a new song)6.Stoned7.Blurry8.Already Gone9.Psycho10.Away From Me11.Drift & DieEncore12.She Hates MePuddle of Mudd at Green Grove GardensGreencastle, United StatesSat, Jan 18, 20251.Blurry2.Out of My Head3.Psycho4.Drift & Die5.She Hates Me6.Control7.Spaceship8.Famous9.Stoned10.Already Gone11.Kiss The Machine ((New song, second time live))Puddle of Mudd at Florida Cracker KitchenBrooksville, United StatesSat, Nov 9, 20241.Stoned2.Out of My Head3.Psycho4.Control5.Already Gone6.Cloud 97.Spin You Around8.Blurry9.Spaceship10.Nothing Left to Lose11.Drift & Die12.Famous13.Away From Me14.She Hates MePowered by Setlist.fm(Opens in new tab)More Setlists(Opens in new tab)Reviews4673.8Rating: 3.8 out of 5 based on 467 reviewsWrite a reviewHell YES !!!!  Must See !by Chas on 3/11/25Rating: 5 out of 5We drove three hours to see the performance in Kinder, LA.  They blew up the stage from the very first song and kept up the pace for the entire performance.  Wes and the band were on fire.  It exceeded my expectations by far.  Fabulous performance, worth every penny we paid !  Of course, the last song was "She hates me". He got the entire crowd engaged and had lots of fun.
Wes announced he would sign shirts, etc. after the show.  He came out, singed our shirts, visited for a minute, even took a picture with us.  I heard he stayed there until every person in line got to meet him.Words do no Justiceby Arnok on 9/5/23Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas - Las VegasRating: 5 out of 5One of the satisfying concert experiences in my life, and I am going to be 60 years old.  Puddle of Mudd was on my bucket list, never got a chance to really see them, and went to Las Vegas to finally do so!  They sang everything I could have hoped for.  Being the grown man that I am, I almost teared up when they sang, "Blurry!"They enhanced my life so much, and am so appreciative in their effort.  My wife and I would like to say "Thank you from the inner most depths of our hearts guys for such an amazing show and will support you going forward each and every day in our thoughts and prayers!"Puddle of mudd venueby Pauly on 9/5/23Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas - Las VegasRating: 5 out of 5Wes still has the chops and vocals to put on a great show. Well done guys! This was 3rd time seeing them. 2 Venues were great 1 was a flop.Started getting Blurry toward the end of the nightby Lezzzlayyy on 9/5/23Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas - Las VegasRating: 5 out of 5Puddle of Mudd was fantastic! Awesome concert! Such a fun venue! Had a blast with great company!Show got canceledby Nevin on 6/8/23XL Live - HarrisburgRating: 4 out of 5Show was canceled due to power outage, but the bands and the venue handled it well.No electricityby Harry b on 6/7/23XL Live - HarrisburgRating: 1 out of 5Electric was out. So unfortunately didn't get to see show at xl live Harrisburg pa.Show for canceledby Michele on 6/6/23XL Live - HarrisburgRating: 2 out of 5A big storm came through and knocked out the power grid 2 songs into the opening act. Puddle of Mudd was not able to performPoor experienceby Ashley on 6/6/23XL Live - HarrisburgRating: 1 out of 5The power had gone out and Wes was letting people take pictures with him and when I was next in line he flipped out and walked away from the line of people very rude and abrupt. Could have been more pleasant and also no info on reimbursement of the show!Power went out, nobody's fault but mother nature.by Chris on 6/6/23XL Live - HarrisburgRating: 3 out of 5A bad storm went through and knocked out power to Club XL after one song of the opening act (Observe the 93rd ). They tried to entertain the crowd with drums and a megaphone for a while. They at least tried. Puddle of Mudd (Wes only) came out sang Blurry to fulfill their obligation and ran off the stage.I haven’t been this disappointed in over 20 yearsby Concerned Concert Goer on 6/6/23XL Live - HarrisburgRating: 1 out of 5Power went out of the facility.  The opening band maybe played three songs.  I give the drummer credit as he tried to keep people entertained.  The bands then tried to get the audience to sing along with various other songs, but it wasn’t the same.  I really haven’t been this disappointed since Ozzy canceled his tour when Sabbath was touring with Disturbed..Page 1 of 24Next page 2Last page 24Fans Also ViewedChevelleTheory of a DeadmanColdPapa RoachAlien Ant FarmSeetherPop EvilCandleboxTicketmaster Footer NavigationTicketmaster LogoLet's connect (Opens in new tab)(Opens in new tab)(Opens in new tab)(Opens in new tab)(Opens in new tab)Download Our Apps(Opens in new tab)(Opens in new tab)By continuing past this page, you agree to our terms of useHelpful LinksHelp/FAQSellMy AccountContact UsGift CardsRefunds and ExchangesDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationGet Started on TicketmasterOur NetworkLive NationHouse of BluesFront Gate TicketsTicketWebuniverseNFLNBANHLAbout UsTicketmaster BlogTicketing TruthsPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesCareersTicket Your EventInnovationFriends & PartnersPayPalAllianzAWSPurchase PolicyPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage my cookies and ad choices© 1999-2025 Ticketmaster.
