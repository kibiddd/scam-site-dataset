lsd is longer than shrooms usually, commit your whole day/night.  i get better visuals from L but i have friends who say the opposite.  you get a harder mindfuck with L than with shrooms.

ohh yeah i read that lastnight, seems like you had a great time. 2 of the people i will be with have taken lsd in the past just one time each, one person took 2 hits the other took one. my friends dad is going to be out all day saturday-sunday, i figured we would just chill listen to some mellow music, smoke a couple joints and just enjoy ourselfs. ( we are 18 ) 2 of my friends will be watching us to make sure we dont do anything dumb. Seems like a good enviroment to trip for my first time on cid so were taking advantage of it. not as exciting as your journey but i dont think id be ready to do something like that my first time. Hits around here are 5$ so i might take 2 if i feel up to it.

sounds like a damn fine first time to me.  all involved in my excursion were very experienced trippers and still almost couldnt deal with the crowds at the aquarium.  but to me, forcing myself to deal with the madness of all the people around me was half the fun!

yeah i kind of know what you mean. the First time i tripped on mushrooms i was with 3 friends sitting in the woods ( one sitter ) during the winter on a sunday, rather warm weather, no leaves on the trees. the sun was hiding behind the clouds. to make the story shorter, my one friend puked this flourescent orange vomit wich made me start not enjoying my peak, so he wound up leaving  by himself on his bike.. cause he thought and said that he thinks they are like "bad"shrooms and maybe we should tell someone..i was like fuck all that. we wound up walking to the other tripping friends house cause no one was home and his sister is an experience tripper, just as im getting over my peak and about to paint with his sis his mom walks in. Theres more to the story but hows that sound for my first trip... All in all it was awesome and visuals were great. I ate an exact 3.5 of all caps, no stems and i washed them down with two water bottles of OJ, my friend had picked up a qp the day before and let me picked what i wanted for 30$

Holy shit. So you're tripping in the back of a cop car and then some sort of holding cell? I'm can't even imagine how bad that had to have been.

i have done both many times and have gotten similar experiences from doing both. sometimes you get a great body buzz and sometimes you get visuals with less body high other times you get crazy amounts of both... its never really the same, i think the high you end up having good or bad is created by what environment you put yourself in.

I think waiting is a good thing. I don't think taking acid inside is a bad idea. I just think dropping with the option of going outside is a better idea. All I wanted to do the other night was go romping through the woods.
