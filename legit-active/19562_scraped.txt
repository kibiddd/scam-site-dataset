Charles Bronfman says the proudest moment of his life                                    was in 1992 at the Sky Dome in Toronto, where he threw the first pitch                                    at the first World Series baseball game ever played outside of the United                                    States. "Then, the next afternoon, I found myself at the Governor                                    General's being invested as a member of the Queen's Privy Council,"                                    says Bronfman leaning back in his chair behind his desk at his home                                    office in Jerusalem's upscale Catamon neighborhood. The sun poured in                                    through the window as he basked in the joy of one of his fondest memories.                                    "Then, at 5:00 p.m. that night, I was made a Companion of the Order                                    of Canada. It was an amazing 24 hours and it all started off with that                                    first pitch," he smiles a warm and compelling smile. "I will                                    never forget it."   A proud Canadian, the 72-year-old, Montreal-born heir                                    to the Seagram liquor empire has done a lot with his good fortune. By                                    age 23, the businessman-at-heart was head of the Seagram Co. Ltd. Thomas                                    Adams division. By age 37, he was the principal owner of the Montreal                                    Expos, the first Major League baseball team in Canada.   But, it is neither his business savvy (Bronfman currently serves as                                    Chairman of Koor Industries Ltd., Israel's largest industrial holding                                    company) nor his self-description as a sports junkie that most predominantly                                    define who Charles Bronfman is today.   In 1985, after establishing the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies                                    Inc. in the United States, Keren Karev in Israel, and the CRB Foundation                                    in Canada-the primary objective of which charities is to develop, implement                                    and support initiatives that help to strengthen both the Canadian national                                    identity and the unity of the Jewish people-philanthropy has become                                    Bronfman's full-time job.   Committed to encouraging young people to strengthen their knowledge                                    and appreciation of their heritage, the Bronfman Philanthropies have                                    been involved in a number of projects involving the Israel Museum, the                                    Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the McGill Institute for the Study                                    of Canada and Historica, just to name a few.   But by far the most dynamic project initiated by Bronfman to date,                                    not to mention one of the greatest contemporary contributions to the                                    future of world Jewry, is birthright israel. Since December 1999, birthright                                    israel has brought over 48,000 young, Jewish adults aged 18 to 26 from                                    around the world, to Israel on free 10-day educational tours.   "Our gamelan is a very simple one," says Bronfman, about                                    his brainchild. "In the age in which young adults live today, they                                    are free to make a choice of where they want to go and what they want                                    to be. But a lot of people at that age don't know what they want to                                    do, and they also don't quite know who they are, what they are and why                                    they are," he claims. "So, we are saying to young adults-particularly                                    those for whom the idea of being Jewish is at least ambivalent, if not                                    downright negative-that it's decision time in your life. You have to                                    make some fundamental decisions and one of them is who you are. So,                                    why don't you come here, meet some other people and meet your peers                                    in Israel and find out something about how all this happened and what                                    the roots are. Then, you have some information. If you want to go further,                                    you go further, and if you don't want to go further, you don't go further.                                    But, armed with some knowledge, some sort of beginning, you'll make                                    a better decision."  The decision to launch birthright israel didn't happen                                    overnight. Although it is hard to imagine a world without the plethora                                    of Israel experience programs that are available to Diaspora youth today, it was Bronfman who came up with the original idea. But                                    he wasn't satisfied with the outcome of the programs he had initiated,                                    which entailed the establishment of a consortium between the UJA, the                                    UJF and the Jewish Agency. "The problem was that nothing much was                                    happening," explains Bronfman. "We just couldn't get the numbers                                    up."   It wasn't until he was approached by fellow philanthropist and birthright                                    israel co-founder Michael Steinhardt that the ball really started rolling.                                    "My wife and I were at an evening session of the International                                    Council at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem when Michael asked to speak                                    with me outside," recalls Bronfman. While chatting about Bronfman's                                    work with Israel experience programs, the idea to send kids to Israel                                    for free, suddenly dawned on them. "I will never forget looking                                    over the Valley of the Dry Bones when the moment of inspiration happened,"                                    says Bronfman, who deliberated with Steinhardt for almost a year after                                    that initial meeting before settling on a funding structure that consisted                                    of a three-way partnership between philanthropists, the government of                                    Israel and the Diaspora communities.   Even after the pair had yet to gain the support of the Israeli government,                                    the communities and nine more philanthropists in order to finance the                                    operation, they were not dissuaded. "We decided to proceed. That                                    decision was made in this very office in June 1999," says Bronfman,                                    his eyes brightening, as he scans the tastefully decorated room. "I                                    can't remember if it was me or Steinhardt, but one of us said, 'But                                    we promised them.' That was the birth of birthright."   Since that fateful day, he says he has received a lot of grief, particularly                                    from the federations. "They say, 'You didn't consult us, you didn't                                    use process, you rammed this down our throats, we didn't want it, it                                    would have been different,' and so on," explains Bronfman. "I                                    guess I was spoiled because I was always able to just make decisions                                    and that would be the end of it. They [the federations] have their process                                    and their consensus, and I don't mind that. But my goodness, it takes                                    time. That's the difference between a bureaucracy and entrepreneurs."   Bronfman says he doesn't regret his decision to go ahead-not for a                                    second. "Had we not made the decision in June 1999, birthright                                    never would have happened," he claims. "If you look at the                                    chronology, the first trips went at the end of December. That winter                                    was an astonishing success. Then, we had the summer trips-another smash.                                    Then, in September 2000, came the intifada."   While it's true that had the program not been established                                    prior to the intifada it would not have the credibility it has today, birthright israel continues                                    to pose a great financial struggle. "To finally get the Israeli                                    government to commit to a five-year program with that kind of money                                    wasn't easy," says Bronfman. "To ask people for huge amounts                                    of money on faith and to deal with fundraising through the federations-only                                    a few of which have gotten involved in the program-is also not easy.                                    We have yet to be able to crack that very important nut. And now, we                                    are in a terrible money crunch. Birthright israel continues to be the                                    greatest challenge of my philanthropic career."   It is the program's overwhelming success that keeps                                    Bronfman going. According to a March 25, 2002, survey by the Maurice                                    and Marilyn Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University                                    of over 1,500 birthright israel participants, the program has had a                                    profound and lasting impact on participants' Jewish identities.   Research professors Leonard Saxe and Charles Kadushin concluded that                                    participants had stronger Jewish identities and more positive attitudes                                    towards Israel, Judaism and the Jewish people, compared to a control                                    group of 150 non-participants who had applied to the program, but didn't                                    go.   "They say that they've never seen numbers like this," comments                                    Bronfman. "But the real measure of birthright israel's success-aside                                    from the fact that during the worst times of the intifada, there even                                    was such a thing as birthright-is the words that you hear from young                                    adults. Even in our travels around Israel, when you mention the word                                    'birthright,' people's eyes light up. To me, it's an astonishing success.                                    It's much more successful than anything that any of us ever dreamed                                    of."   So, what is it about birthright israel that makes it so special? According                                    to Bronfman, the answer is Israel. "If [our ancestors] struggled                                    so hard and their struggle was so costly in terms of every human quality                                    that we know, well then this place has got to be very special, and I                                    think there's that feeling that this place is very special. So, when                                    people come here, they probably feel that," he says.  Not having grown up in a particularly religiously observant household-as                                    a child, Bronfman and his brother were the first Jews to attend Trinity                                    College School in Port Hope, Ontario, an experience he describes as                                    "the three most difficult years of my life"-did not make him                                    unreceptive to the spirit of Israel when he came on his first trip to                                    the country in 1958. Quite the contrary.   Bronfman had come with his best friend and his wife, the three of                                    whom met with then-Deputy Assistant Minister of Defense Shimon Peres,                                    along with a handful of other budding Israeli political leaders. "I                                    came to Israel out of curiosity, more than anything else," he says.                                    "I liked it. There were certain things that I thought were emotionally                                    appealing. There were other things that I thought were intellectually                                    appealing. But most of all, I was very curious as to how the country                                    would develop."   Sensing the tension in the Israeli air, that first trip inspired Bronfman                                    to predict a few of the country's longest-standing obstacles. "An                                    IDF army spokesman took us on a tour of some of the not-so-nice parts                                    of Tel Aviv." He recalls telling the officer that he was lucky                                    for not having had to confront Israel's real problems yet. "He                                    said, 'What do you mean? We have problems all the time,' and I responded,                                    'Yeah, but your real problems are going to be the gaps between the rich                                    and the poor and the rift between the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim.                                    Right now, you are concentrating on physical survival and you will survive.                                    Once that's been established, you will get into the real problems of                                    your society.'"   Bronfman cast down his eyes in disappointment at the accuracy of his                                    forecast. But despite, or perhaps because of the plethora of serious                                    social issues that have developed throughout Israel's history, Bronfman                                    chooses to spend three months of every summer living in Israel with                                    his wife, Andy [Andrea] and dog, Yoffi, in a lovely home built by her                                    parents some thirty years ago. "I feel very much at home in Israel,"                                    says Bronfman, who together with Andy has taken up studying Torah from                                    an historical and sociological perspective, rather than a religious                                    one. States Bronfman, "My teacher says the whole question that                                    Genesis poses is can a dysfunctional family at the end of the day make                                    it? And the answer is yes.   "I have believed for a long time now that the                                    Jewish people have some kind of destiny. I don't think tikkun olam is                                    a joke. The Jewish people who are around are around for a reason. I                                    don't know exactly what that is, but I do know that there is so much                                    talent in the Jewish people," says Bronfman, who pointed to the                                    continuation of Judaism throughout                                    the Spanish Inquisition as an unbelievable instance of Jewish preservation. "It boggles                                    my mind," he says. "I would have been the fastest convert                                    this side of Madrid. But why didn't they?   "That is why Israel is a miracle," he continues, passion                                    flaring in his eyes. "I feel that if you are Jewish and you don't                                    have a real emotional connection with Israel, you're missing something                                    very important to your neshama [soul]. All of these introductions we                                    make-through birthright, for instance-just expands the consolidation                                    of the Jewish people as a people," he maintains.   "That's why I hope that birthright becomes a permanent part of                                    the Jewish journey and of growing up and becoming an adult. Frankly,                                    we have enough faith in the magic of Israel that the decision of participants                                    will be to stay Jewish 80% of the time. And that is pretty cool."  Sources: LifeStyles          Magazine
