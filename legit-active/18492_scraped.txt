TELETOON BREAKS NEW GROUND WITH LATEST ORIGINAL PRODUCTION SLATE
New shows include a live-action series and an online and television-integrated series
TELETOON Canada inc. today announced that five new Canadian original series have been greenlit for production. New projects include comedy series Crash Canyon and Detentionaire, live-action/animation hybrid series Mudpit, a social, web and TV-integrated series called GeoFreakZ, and My Babysitter’s A Vampire, a live-action series based on the MOW of the same name.
In addition to these titles, TELETOON is developing the following new series: Quasitoon Tim (Sardine Productions), Artificial Idol (DHX Media), Gofers (Neptoon Studios), Sherlock Legacy (Bejuba) and the older-skewing Senior Years (Fresh TV Inc.).
TELETOON’s fall 2010 schedule also boasts a large number of original productions including new seasons of popular series Total Drama World Tour and Johnny Test along with new shows Skatoony, My Babysitter’s a Vampire (MOW) and Dating Guy.
TELETOON is a major supporter of the Canadian animation industry and kids television industry and has invested more than $225 million in the creation, development and production of Canadian content since 1997. As part of its commitment to the industry, TELETOON is proud to sponsor the Kids and Animation Program at the 2010 Banff World Television Festival.

Motoring between tourist attractions, scenic vistas and the occasional point of interest, the trip turns to catastrophe when the family vehicle goes off a cliff. As the Wendells stumble out, they realize that not only are they alive, but also that they are not alone as the same fate has befallen several others before them, forming a community known only as Crash Canyon. This comedy series is produced by Breakthrough’s Ira Levy, Peter Williamson and Executive Producer Joan Lambur with Joel Cohen (Co-Executive Producer, The Simpsons).
DETENTIONAIRE

It’s goodbye freedom, goodbye girls and hello worst year of his life. Detentionaire follows Lee in his attempts to uncover the mystery behind the practical joke and clear his name. Detentionaire is created by Daniel Bryan Franklin & Charles Johnston, produced by Tracey Dodokin and executive produced by Doug Murphy.
