France
France (French: [fʁɑ̃s]), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a sovereign state comprising territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European part of France, called metropolitan France, extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. France spans 643,801 square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and has a total population of 66.6 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. The Constitution of France establishes the state as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people.
During the Iron Age, what is now Metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The Gauls were conquered in 51 BC by the Roman Empire, which held Gaul until 486. The Gallo-Romans faced raids and migration from the Germanic Franks, who dominated the region for hundreds of years, eventually creating the medieval Kingdom of France. France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) strengthening French state-building and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy. During the Renaissance, France experienced a vast cultural development and established the beginning of a global colonial empire. The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots).

France Ô
France Ô (pronounced: [fʁɑ̃s o]) is a French public television network featuring programming from the French overseas departments and collectivities in Metropolitan France. It is part of the France Télévisions group. Its overseas counterpart is Outre-Mer 1ère.
It is available through cable, satellite, ADSL and the new digital terrestrial television system.
Formerly known as RFO Sat, the channel was originally broadcasting 9 hours per day only. It was re-branded France Ô in 2004 in order to better show it was part of the France Télévisions group. The "O" stands for Outre-mer (overseas), and the accent shows that the channel was opened to all accents and dialects of the world, but also ensures that the name of the channel is not read as France 0 ("France zéro").
The channel became available in overseas territories in November 2010, replacing the RFO-operated Tempo.

French wine
French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7–8 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France as the Margnat wines were during the post war period.
Two concepts central to higher end French wines are the notion of "terroir", which links the style of the wines to the specific locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made, and the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system. Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France's several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover entire regions, individual villages or even specific vineyards.

Francis the 1st - The King of France (1515-1547) - The Great King
Son of Charles of Angoulême and Louise of Savoy, Francis 1st succeeded his cousin Louis XII in 1515, whose daughter Claude he married.  Widowed later in life, he remarried with Éléonore de Habsbourg, the sister of Charles Quint.
Francis 1st is undoubtedly one of the builders of the modern state in France. He reorganized state finances and reformed the judicial system with the Villers-Cotterêts ordinance (1539).  King Francis 1st also promoted the art of the Renaissance, which flourished in the construction and decoration of royal residences (Blois, Chambord, Fontainebleau), where he commissioned Italian artists (Leonardo da Vinci, Rosso , the Primatice). He also encouraged translations by philosophers and founded the future Collège de France. When he died in 1547, his son Henri II succee...

King Louis XIV of France | The Sun King (Versailles)
"I know who I am. I am Louis XIV, and I am the King of France."
During the second half of the 17th century, King Louis XIV was a very powerful man who built and extended upon his father's old hunting lodge called Versailles. Believing in divine rights and his kingship to be destined by God (like most monarchs during that period *cough* Charles I of England), this made Louis XIV very ambitious and therefore dangerous. Inviting all the nobles of France, he created a mini world, a kingdom within a kingdom. In Versailles, everyone had to abide by his rules and attend certain events in a certain way at a specific time. Feeling almost like a prison I imagine. Versailles is still one of the most beautifully built places on Earth and I will end up going there one day! This TV show was a really gr...

Louis XIV: The World's Longest Reigning Monarch | 1715: The Sun King is Dead | Real Royalty
His reign was the longest in world history. In fact, his contemporaries thought the Sun King to be immortal. But in the summer of 1715, Louis XIV finally met his fate and died at the age of 76 in his architectural masterpiece: the Chateau of Versailles. His painful agony due to a devastating disease – gangrene – lasted 23 days and revealed the incompetence of physicians, furtive court intrigues and jealousies. His death caused a crisis of succession with consequences that would affect the whole of Europe. Louis XIV’s passing brought an end to the Grand Siècle and heralded the birth of the Enlightenment.
Louis XIV faced his death with the same panache he had shown throughout his entire reign. It was a magnificent show, a ‘good death’, performed in public. The final act of an extraordinary ...

George Blagden is outstanding in this role, as is Alexander Vlahos who plays his brother Phillipe. I also thought George was brilliant as Athelstan in Vikings prior to this role.

https://wn.com/Louis_Xiv_The_World's_Longest_Reigning_Monarch_|_1715_The_Sun_King_Is_Dead_|_Real_Royalty
His reign was the longest in world history. In fact, his contemporaries thought the Sun King to be immortal. But in the summer of 1715, Louis XIV finally met his fate and died at the age of 76 in his architectural masterpiece: the Chateau of Versailles. His painful agony due to a devastating disease – gangrene – lasted 23 days and revealed the incompetence of physicians, furtive court intrigues and jealousies. His death caused a crisis of succession with consequences that would affect the whole of Europe. Louis XIV’s passing brought an end to the Grand Siècle and heralded the birth of the Enlightenment.
Louis XIV faced his death with the same panache he had shown throughout his entire reign. It was a magnificent show, a ‘good death’, performed in public. The final act of an extraordinary life that would seal the legend of the greatest king of France.
Filmed in Versailles, Notre-Dame of Paris and at the Basilica of Saint Denis, this film blends historical reconstructions, rare archives, period journals, and the contributions of contemporary experts, to pay homage as never before to the most legendary of France’s kings.
From Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.

Son of Charles of Angoulême and Louise of Savoy, Francis 1st succeeded his cousin Louis XII in 1515, whose daughter Claude he married.  Widowed later in life, he remarried with Éléonore de Habsbourg, the sister of Charles Quint.
Francis 1st is undoubtedly one of the builders of the modern state in France. He reorganized state finances and reformed the judicial system with the Villers-Cotterêts ordinance (1539).  King Francis 1st also promoted the art of the Renaissance, which flourished in the construction and decoration of royal residences (Blois, Chambord, Fontainebleau), where he commissioned Italian artists (Leonardo da Vinci, Rosso , the Primatice). He also encouraged translations by philosophers and founded the future Collège de France. When he died in 1547, his son Henri II succeeded him.

"I know who I am. I am Louis XIV, and I am the King of France."
During the second half of the 17th century, King Louis XIV was a very powerful man who built and extended upon his father's old hunting lodge called Versailles. Believing in divine rights and his kingship to be destined by God (like most monarchs during that period *cough* Charles I of England), this made Louis XIV very ambitious and therefore dangerous. Inviting all the nobles of France, he created a mini world, a kingdom within a kingdom. In Versailles, everyone had to abide by his rules and attend certain events in a certain way at a specific time. Feeling almost like a prison I imagine. Versailles is still one of the most beautifully built places on Earth and I will end up going there one day! This TV show was a really great series and I was gutted it ended the way it did. George Blagden is outstanding in this role, as is Alexander Vlahos who plays his brother Phillipe. I also thought George was brilliant as Athelstan in Vikings prior to this role.

Attempting to cover the history country of France in just one video! Starting with the tribal Frankish kingdoms, the rivalry with the England and the Habsburgs, the various wars France has fought, the reign of the famous Louis XIV, to the iconic French Revolution and the Napoleon, all the way to the World Wars and road to becoming the French Fifth Republic, the country that France is today.
Obviously I had to cut a LOT out, and oversimplify at times. That's a necessity for a video like this, which has been a very daunting!
This could potentially be the beginning of a new series, so I would love for some feedback on this video, and maybe even your suggestion for a future episode!

France
France (French: [fʁɑ̃s]), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a sovereign state comprising territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European part of France, called metropolitan France, extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. France spans 643,801 square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and has a total population of 66.6 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. The Constitution of France establishes the state as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people.
During the Iron Age, what is now Metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The Gauls were conquered in 51 BC by the Roman Empire, which held Gaul until 486. The Gallo-Romans faced raids and migration from the Germanic Franks, who dominated the region for hundreds of years, eventually creating the medieval Kingdom of France. France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) strengthening French state-building and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy. During the Renaissance, France experienced a vast cultural development and established the beginning of a global colonial empire. The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots).
