Governance
CAN is governed by an international Board of Directors elected from the membership at the annual General Assembly. The Board reflects the balance and composition of the network, including geographic and gender balance. Board Members are representatives of CAN as a whole and do not represent their individual regions or organisations.

CAN Charter
The CAN Charter is the document that gives clarity on the way the CAN network is organised and works. CAN is a network of NGOs working on climate change from around the world. These members are autonomous and independent. Many of these members have their own forms of organisation and their own national or regional rules.
In joining the CAN network, members contributed to producing these constitutional rules and guidelines for the network. This document tends to facilitate and enable decision-making, rather than prescribe rules.
Anti-Bullying and Harassment Policy
CAN International is committed to providing an experience safe of bullying or harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, in the spaces in which CAN-International membership convenes and where our staff work.
CAN International has an anti-bullying and anti-harassment policy in place for its staff, volunteers, interns and contractors and is currently developing further steps toward building institutions and structures to address harassment and bullying within those spaces
Bullying and Harassment Reporting and Complaints
CAN is providing a fully independent reporting and complaints platform for members at CAN-I events and for CAN-I workers. If you experience bullying or harassment or have concerns about bullying or harassment, either as the person affected or as a bystander, you are encouraged to disclose these concerns or report a complaint. If you decide to make a disclosure, you will be able to remain in control over how it is handled and how much information you want to disclose.
The service is provided by EthicsPoint (currently in English only), which many of our larger member organizations and other international organizations are using with great success and satisfaction, and which ensures that the reporting and complaints procedure is completely independent of any CAN structures, which, among other benefits ensures that complaints or reports can also be made with confidence if they involve the designated people.*
If a concern is raised or a report made, EthicsPoint will forward the complaint to NonProfitHR, an HR consultancy, who will then appropriately channel the concern or report to the designated people*, including recommendations as appropriate.
*For CAN-International events or CAN-International staff, the designated people are Tasneem Essop, Executive Director, as well as Mariana Paoli and Essia Guezzi, the designated CAN-I board members. For USCAN-related reports, the designees are Keya Chatterjee, Executive Director, and Rachel Potter, board chair, and David Thurnbull, board secretary.
