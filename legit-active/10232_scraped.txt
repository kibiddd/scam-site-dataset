Seen here in this matte silver and summit white colorway is Nike Sportswear’s Sky Force 88 low sneaker, making its return in a new vintage version. This season welcomes the 1984 Nike Sky Force with its chunkier profile and a vintage looking sole. Standard Force branding on the tongue and Nike’s branding on the heel are both part of the otherwise subtle detailing that mark the shoe. Available for pre-order today, head over to Crooked Tongues to purchase the shoe for €70 EUR (approximately $95 USD).
