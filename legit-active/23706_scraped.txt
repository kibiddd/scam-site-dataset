Chicago Bears History
Chicago Bears History 1999-2024
Please visit Chicago Bears History on Internet Archive to browse the old site.  Also check out my new adventures, which will start to contain more content soon.  Chicago Bears History on Facebook, and my YouTube Channel Dey Were DaBears. For a great read on Chicago Bears history from 1920-2004, consider buying my Chicago Bears Book.
Chicago Bears History started as a graduate class project in 1999.  I was glad to share WAY more information on the history of the Chicago Bears than the organization itself did for the first 10 years. But who reads static web pages anymore?  Hope you'll check out my new ventures. Thanks for 25 years. Bear Down.
