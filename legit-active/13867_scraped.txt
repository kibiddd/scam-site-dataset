Share on WhatsApp The North American premiere of Roman Polanski’s latest film, “Carnage,” will open the 49th New York Film Festival September 30th, the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which produces the anticipated annual event, said Friday.
Based on Yasmina Reza’s “God of Carnage,” the 2009 Tony Award-winner for Best Play, “Carnage” follows the events of an evening when two Brooklyn couples are brought together after their children are involved in a playground fight. Produced by Said Ben Said, the Sony Pictures Classics release stars Academy Award winners Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz and Academy Award nominee John C. Reilly.
“From ‘Knife in the Water’ (which screened at the first edition of NYFF in 1963) to ‘Repulsion’ to ‘The Tenant,’ Roman Polanski has shown himself to be an absolute master at making the most restricted spaces come to dramatic life. In ‘Carnage,’ aided by four remarkable performances, he has reached a new pinnacle in his already extraordinary career,” commented Richard Peña, Selection Committee Chair & Program Director, The Film Society of Lincoln Center in a statement.

Added FSLC executive director Rose Kuo: “”We are delighted to kick off the festival with a quintessential New York story featuring superb performances from a quartet of the finest actors working today. The film will certainly provoke the kind of discussions about contemporary issues that guarantee a memorable night.”
The 17-day New York Film Festival spotlights some of the most anticipated world cinema of the year. The selection committee, chaired by Peña also includes: Melissa Anderson, Freelance Critic; Scott Foundas, Associate Program Director, The Film Society of Lincoln Center; Dennis Lim, Editor, Moving Image Source & Freelance Critic; and Todd McCarthy, Chief Film Critic, The Hollywood Reporter.
The 49th NYFF takes place September 30 – October 16.
General Public tickets will be available September 12th. There will be an advance ticketing opportunity for Film Society of Lincoln Center Patrons and Members prior to that date.
The Film Society of Lincoln Center will release NYFF’s full slate later this summer.
