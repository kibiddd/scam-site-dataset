All Shall Perish – Awaken The Dreamers                                lyrics
They're coming
Begin to light we must ignite the creed to fight begin our night
They're coming
Wake up the dreamers we demand the need of rights
In the dead of night a hero sets his sights to warn of destruction
A call of arms begins the motion.
There is no good bye no second glances
For in the midst
We, We see a glimpse
Of mass oppression coming to take our lives
They can't take our fight
We're living free of monarchy
Brothers take hands
It's our time to give this nation it's only chance.
Not one step back
A true man will take a stand.
Liberty rings
Echoing through the streets the beginning of everything.
Take pride for this is the picture we must live by or die, or die
They're coming
Begin to light we must ignite we creed to fight begin our night
They're coming
Wake up the dreamers we demand the need of rights
How can we sleep at night?
Knowing that were hidden by our lack of emotion
Just stoic disposition what robotic guise.
Simply take time to remember our forefathers plight.
How could we make light of such a momentous fight?
Could we ever make ourselves right?
Don't stand for another moment wasted.
