An edgy, unpredictable comedian with a flair for deranged characters and weird observational humor, Zach Galifianakis poked and prodded audiences with his unique combination of cuddle and menace in films, television and on stage. A college dropout who abandoned academia to focus on comedy, Galifianakis built a reputation as a sharp improvisational comic capable of squeezing painful laughter out of the most awkward situations. Though his knack for off-kilter characters landed him roles in a myriad of forgettable television series, he became known for small, but memorable roles in quirky indie films like "Being John Malkovich" (1999) and "What Happens in Vegas" (2008). His bizarre cameos in cult hits like "Reno 911" (Comedy Central, 2003-09) and "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job" (2007-2010), as well as his mock talk show, "Between Two Ferns With Zach Galifianakis" on the Funny or Die website, earned him a loyal fanbase among college-age hipsters and stoners. But with his starring turn in the unexpected summer smash, "The Hangover" (2009), the wild and wooly comedian finally entered the mainstream. He went on to appear in other high-profile comedies like "Due Date" (2010), "Dinner for Schmucks" (2010) and the hugely successful sequel "The Hangover Part II" (2011), all of which quickly made him one of Hollywood's resident go-to comedy stars. Branching out, Galifianakis also appeared in more somber fare like the Best Picture winner "Birdman" (2014) and Tom Stoppard-penned historical drama "Tulip Fever" (2016).
