STRATEGIES FOR NON-FICTION TEXT
★ Decide
the PURPOSE of reading a particular text.
- research, writing
a report, textbook assignment, personal interest, etc.
Knowing the PURPOSE
will help you decide what information and ideas are the most important
to remember and learn.
★ Think
about what you already KNOW and
feel.
This will get your
brain activated and ready to learn about a particular topic. It will
allow your brain to connect new information to information that you
already have stored in your brain.
★ PREVIEW the text.
- Pictures, graphs,
bold font, heading, captions, etc.
This will also help activate your
brain and get it ready for learning. The previewing will allow
your brain to prepare for specific types of information that you
are about to read.
★ Break
the text into small chunks, slow down, re-read.
There are many facts
and ideas that are presented in non-fiction text. Trying to learn
from such text can be difficult or overwhelming at times. These strategies
will help minimize the overload of information you are taking in
at one time and will dramatically increase your understanding and
comprehension.
★ Other Strategies you can use to understand, organize and remember what you read:
Picture it
Make connections
Keep notes
Make predictions
Ask questions
Don't accept nonsense
