Benefit DVD for Henri Pachard Scheduled

LOS ANGELES — Industry members are rallying to produce a benefit DVD for Henri Pachard. The legendary adult director has been battling mouth and throat cancer for the last several years, and it was recently reported that he had suffered  a recurrence .
When news spread of Pachard’s (whose real name is Ron Sullivan) situation, he and his wife Deloras were contacted by several industry members that had worked with Pachard over the years, including performer Amber Lynn.
Lynn and veteran performer Bill Margold have banded together with the idea to put together a benefit DVD for Pachard, and on Saturday posted a video clip on YouTube, appealing to other industry members to join in the efforts.
The DVD is tentatively titled, “We Are the World of XXX.” So far, a two-day production has been scheduled for June 10-11 and, according to Lynn, several performers and crewmembers have signed on to be part of the shoot.
Performers that have volunteered include Ron Jeremy, Manuel Ferrara, Stephanie Swift, Jeremy Steele, Emerald, Dave Cummings, Blake Palmer, Debi Diamond, Brandon Iron, Mr. Marcus, Herschel Savage and Cara Lott, as well as Georgina Spelvin, Paul Thomas and Margold in non-sex roles.
Directors and crewmembers that have volunteered their services include Roy Karch, Jeff Mullen, Michael Manning, Axel Braun and Red Ezra, among others. Jane Waters will be director of photography.
“The idea is that we do it together and I’ve just never had so much cooperation from everybody. I’ve had an outpouring of people coming to the table, but we need some more big name talent,” Lynn told XBIZ.
“How many times, when you find out that a friend has fallen ill or fallen on hard times, and you look and say, ‘Oh my God, if I would have known, I would have done more,’” Lynn said.
“Well, we have an opportunity here to come together and do something for this man while he’s still alive, to make what’s happening in his life a lot easier on him,” she said. “Not necessarily by giving money, because this is a difficult time for a lot of people. But what we can do is show up for a day and volunteer.”
According to Lynn, who is organizing the production, she will direct under the guidance of Pachard and his wife Deloras will also be involved in shooting camera for the project.
Lynn wanted to express her gratitude to all industry members that had volunteered, but also wanted to put out a call to anyone in the industry that has had a relationship with Pachard or been affected by his contributions to adult films.
The director of such classics as “Babylon Pink,” several installments of the Swedish Erotica series, as well as hundreds of other titles, Pachard began his career in the ‘70s and worked with many classic stars of the ‘80s and ‘90s.
Lynn told XBIZ that she would like to invite director/performers John Leslie, Joey Silvera and Jamie Gillis take part in the project, and that Pachard has also mentioned Randy Spears, Tom Byron and Ginger Lynn.
But because it is a volunteer effort, Lynn said, above all, she would like to see the news spread so that those who would like to participate can have a chance to make their appearance.
Margold told XBIZ he will perform a non-sex role. His character sits in a bathroom and listens to the stories told to him by various characters. The bathroom scenes are homage to Pachard, who used them often in his movies.
Lynn says they are still hoping for two big name starlets to play the roles of God and the Devil. They are also in the process of finding production assistants to help with lighting and sound.
On June 11, a party scene will be shot that will include an orgy sequence, involving only active talent. However, non-sex performers are encouraged to attend to be part of the scene. On that day, BTS cameras will record those that would like to have their reminiscences of their experiences with Pachard taped for the DVD’s bonus features.
A location house has been donated by adult investment firm AdultVest, though is still unconfirmed. Lynn also reported that distribution is being negotiated with a major distributor and is close to being finalized.
In addition to her efforts with the DVD project, Lynn will also appear at the Erotica LA consumer show, scheduled for June 6-8 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. She will autograph posters at the Protecting Adult Welfare (P.A.W.) booth with proceeds going to a fund for Pachard.
Interested parties that would like more information can contact Lynn at amberlynn@clubgirl.net.
Those that would like to make a monetary contribution can make checks out to Margold’s nonprofit organization P.A.W. with “Henri Pachard Fund” written in the memo. The mailing address for P.A.W. is 17400 Marilla St., Northridge, Calif., 91325. For more information about P.A.W., call (818) 501-6139.
