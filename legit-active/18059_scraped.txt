Fliiby
August 8th, 2018
Hi everybody â€“
After 11 years of operating Fliiby and more than 200 millions visitors globally weâ€™re shutting down the service today.
What happened?
Many things led to this decision. 11 yearsâ€¦. Fliiby lived, Fliiby died. It was an OK service, one of first-mover's in the file sharing industry, that tried to organize worlds first file library by directly supporting the content creators. Some people liked it, some didnâ€™t, but that doesnâ€™t matter anymore. The world evolved and so have we. We had ups and downs, we were a passionate bunch, we had fun and we were very, very luckyâ€”until we werenâ€™t so lucky anymore, but we didnâ€™t quit. We focused on new things and thatâ€™s now where we want to dedicate all our efforts.
This is why this story ends today, with no regrets and much learnings.
Thank you to all of you who worked with us! Our users, employees, investors, friends and family.
Till next venture...
â€“ The Fliiby team
