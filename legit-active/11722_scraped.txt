(5:00 p.m.: Updated with comment from Spisak's lawyer.)
Gov. John Kasich has denied Frank Spisak's request to avoid execution, meaning the Nazi sympathizer who shot and killed three people on Cleveland State's campus in 1982 will assuredly be put to death next Thursday.
Spisak, 59, had asked Kasich, a Republican, to spare his life. Spisak and his lawyers pleaded for clemency because Spisak is severely mentally ill with a bipolar disorder.
Kasich did not elaborate on his decision in the news release announcing the denial.
Spisak's execution next week will be the first under Kasich's watch. The Ohio Parole Board last month unanimously recommended Kasich deny Spisak's clemency request. Spisak has exhausted all his legal appeals.
Spisak’s victims were Tim Sheehan, a CSU employee; the Rev. Horace Rickerson; and 17-year-old CSU student Brian Warford.
Spisak said he committed the killings because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler and was in a war of survival "of the Aryan people," according to court records.
Aside from his Nazi devotion - Spisak wore a Hitler-style mustache and gave a Nazi salute during his trial - Spisak also was sexually confused. He sometimes cross-dressed and called himself Frances Anne Spisak.
Rickerson and Warford were black, and prosecutors said Sheehan was a potential witness in Rickerson’s killing.
Spisak admitted to the killings in an interview with the Parole Board on Jan. 4, but he said he was mentally ill at the time.
Spisak told the board that the murders he committed are no different from those carried out by killers who avoided the death penalty, according to the Parole Board’s report.
Spisak also said he no longer follows Nazi beliefs and is a more tolerant person. However, he called himself a student of Hitler and the Nazis and told the board he was reading Hitler’s biography. Spisak also compared his execution to "death camps."
Spisaks lawyer's said they are deeply disappointed by Kasichs decision.
"The failure of leadership to move the State of Ohio past the point where it is acceptable to execute the severely mentally ill is another opportunity lost," Alan Rossman, Spisaks federal public defender, said in a statement. "Maybe someday we will have a better alternative to dealing with mentally ill defendants than killing them."If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
