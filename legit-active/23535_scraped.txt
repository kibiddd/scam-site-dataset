She was born in Meadows of Dan, Va., on May 23, 1925, the daughter of Elder Samuel Edwin and Dorothy Jessup Terry.  She was preceded in death by her husband of 52 years, Roger Oliver Slusher Jr.; and by three of her brothers, Marvin, Reuben and Wesley Terry.  Survivors include four children and their spouses, Roger and Leslie Slusher, of Narvon, Pa., Alice Slusher, Terry and Katie Slusher, George Slusher and Ann-Margaret Shortt, all of Floyd, Va.; five grandchildren also survive, Dr. Corinne Medina and husband, Dr. Pablo Medina, Carl Slusher, Ashley Slusher and fiance, Tony Kendrick, Reuben Slusher and Daisy Slusher. Evelyn is also survived by five younger siblings and spouses, sisters, Frances Terry Cock, Owen and Lois Terry Dalton; and brothers, Sam and Julia Terry, Hubert and Vera Terry, David and Audrey Terry. She is also survived by sisters-in-law, Nan Terry, Eloise Terry, Odetta Terry, Neva Simmons, Ruth Ann Slusher and Judy McDanel.  The last surviving member of Conner's Grove Primitive Baptist Church, Evelyn was baptized along with R.O. on January 22, 1967. Faith was central to her life and she served the church as long as her health allowed.  Music was an important part of her life. She enjoyed singing and playing guitar as a member of the Over the Hill Gang. Evelyn's teaching experiences ranged from two room school to high school. Evelyn came to the farm on Rush Fork as a bride in 1954. She loved hiking the hills, searching for quartz crystals and cleaning out springheads. She built most of the rock structures in Slusher Park and relished the hours spent maintaining her vegetable and flower gardens, berry patches and lawn.  Family was all important to Evelyn. As the eldest daughter in a family of nine children, she helped raise her youngest siblings and remained very close to all of them. She treasured each of her grandchildren. One of her greatest joys was hosting the extended Terry family for camp out and reunion weekends in Slusher Park and watching three more generations playing together there.  The family will always be grateful to Karyn Rainey for filling Evelyn's final six years with love and laughter. Many thanks also to Ada Belcher, Nanette West, Mandy Cromer, Loretta Callahan, Brenda Atkins and Christy Roop, for the care and comfort they gave to her.  Funeral Service will be held at 3 p.m. on Friday, November 25, 2011, at Maberry Funeral Home with Elder Tim McGrady officiating. Interment to follow at Jacksonville Cemetery. The family will receive friends from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. on Friday, November 25, 2011, at the funeral home.
