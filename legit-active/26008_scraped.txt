I won't go into great detail because I hate to speak ill of others but due to another surgeon forgetting to close a major artery & her unwillingness to admit her mistake, Dr. Cassidy was paged & found that I'd lost 60% of my blood supply, my blood pressure was 40/40. Dr. Cassidy could have watched me die with no guilt because he didn't cause the issue. Dr. Cassidy was honest with me & promised he'd do his best. I'm still here. Dr. Cassidy is an honorable man.
