Is Stevie Blackthorne going to college?  How is Daryl doing?
Thank you for another very good book by a GREAT author.

Manibog   (Sunday, 2 Mar 2003 06:03)I have read every Ann Rule book. Once I start reading, I can't stop!  I am just finishing "Every Breath You Take". Another great one! She is definitely the 'queen of true crime.' I find it totally amazing that Ms. Rule can write so much, so well, AND do all the touring and speaking that she does. She is TRULY amazing! I wish had such talent & energy.>>By Annie Bruce   (Monday, 21 Apr 2003 22:41)I just read "Every Breathe You Take" in one day! I was captivated, and I couldn't put it down. I was wondering though, if you have the address to Jamie Bellush's website for Shelia, I have done a search engine, and I can't find it! Love your books, hate that you are able to write them, but they intrigue and give you insight to the type of people that are really out there!>>By Faith Ownby   (Monday, 12 May 2003 15:45)I just finished "Every Breath You Take" and couldn't put it down.My heart just ached at the thought of the quads being there the whole time this happened and Stevie finding her.I have two toddlers of my own so I can only imagine how Jamie felt.What an avoidable tragedy.My thoughts are with the family.>>By Mel   (Thursday, 22 May 2003 13:57)Love her.>>By Yunica Lund   (Friday, 23 May 2003 23:05)Maureen Blackthorne was indicted in a $500,000 tax fraudcase in March 2003 http://www.msnbc.com/local/kmol/d-608c095b-129b-4b01-87c3-ab7ad01fa0fb.asp>>By Jackie   (Friday, 30 May 2003 18:36)I just finished "Every Breathe You Take"....I could not put it down!  Does anyone know what is going on with these families now? Anne Rule "RULES"!>>By Terry Kelly   (Tuesday, 24 Jun 2003 02:30)where do you find the answers to the questions?>>By debi   (Saturday, 28 Jun 2003 19:05)I just finished reading "Every Breath You Take" and was extremely relieved when a Guilty veridict was returne don both counts as to Allen Blackthorne.  Also appreciated the "Afterword" section in the back, giving us an update on the girls attending college, Jamie getting re-married, and most importantly to me, the fact that the two sisters (Stevie and Daryl) are sharing together as sisters.  Hopefully, they can have the type of relationship tht Kerry and Sheila had.  Sheila's spirit is SO alive....Ann, you DID do good by her!!>>By Lynn Zotz   (Saturday, 28 Jun 2003 20:46)I cannot put this book down! I have always been an huge fan of Ann Rule.

WOW! For updated information on some of the people in the book I went to Ann Rules website at www.annrules.com/news3.htm>>By Lorna   (Thursday, 17 Jul 2003 19:00)Fantastic book, could not put it down.>>By Julie.uk   (Sunday, 20 Jul 2003 16:20)I have just finished my first Ann Rule book.  It was Every Breath You Take.  Having lived in San Antonio for some five years around the time period that Sheila would have lived there, made the book all the more interesting.  I was wondering if any of the news orgnizations was considering a follow up on Jamie and the children?  My heart broke as I read about Sheila's life and the life her children would ulitmately live.  This book was excellent in its descriptions and coverage on everything from their childhood to the bitter end.  Thank you to Ann Rule for putting such a fascinating story out to the public.>>By Melody Overton   (Tuesday, 22 Jul 2003 05:43)Hi,I emailed Ann Rule to find out about Jamie's Website and here is what she said:'' I'm sorry, but Jamie took his website off about two years ago at his lawyer's request. He has remarried--to a woman who is a lawyer. She has as little boy the quads' age.Jamie never talked to me, and badmouthed my book whenever and wherever he could, so I am not particularly impressed with him. He kicked both of Sheila's older daughters out when they were very young, and they have lived with Kerry and Rick Bladorn. Both girls are in college now, and doing pretty well.''>>By Merryl   (Tuesday, 22 Jul 2003 17:33)Jamie's e-mail, according to a website from 1998, is bellush@planet.net.  However, after reading the comment above by Merryl, I'm not sure one would want to get too involved..... I also love Ann Rule and have read all of her books.  She's the greatest writer we've had the pleasure of knowing.>>By Cindie   (Sunday, 27 Jul 2003 16:33)I have the same questions as the others, how are Stevie and Daryl, and the quads?>>By Dianne   (Monday, 28 Jul 2003 16:30)I love everything she's ever written, would love to know answers to questions above.>>By Gayle   (Monday, 28 Jul 2003 18:57)I just finished Ann Rules fantastic book...I asked Ann why Sheila was buried in New Jersey instead of Florida and her response was that Jamies family were from New Jersey and he wanted her to rest there.Jamie has become very rude to Sheilas daughters and family, Sheilas family are not permitted to visit her grave.I leave the rest to you viewers. The Girls are doing very well right now.>>By Mitchw   (Wednesday, 8 Oct 2003 03:20)I am just into the first 100 pages of the book so maybe i spoiled it for myself by logging onto this site-i mean now i know what happened to Allen but i just can't get enough of this story. What a wonderful author Miss Rule is--I don't quite get how to get the answers to the questions asked above--I sure am curious--Reading the book Jamie seems like a wonderful man--what happened-How could he turn his back on the family like that? What a wonderful read---and what a nice site here>>By bark   (Sunday, 19 Oct 2003 22:47)What a compelling read. Isn't it shocking how many lives have been altered/destroyed by this one man's vendetta. Can't wait to read more of Ann's books!>>By Chase   (Tuesday, 21 Oct 2003 20:55)I am not quite finished reading  Every Breath You Take however, I was looking for info on Jamie Bellush and was directed here. I am amazed at what I have read here about him. If this is true I feel so sorry for him. He is missing out on so much. Stevie and Daryl didn't deserve to loose their mother and the one man that could have been the closest thing of a father to them. I hope that the girls are doing well my prayers are with them.>>By momofthreegirls   (Wednesday, 12 Nov 2003 03:39)I'm almost finnished reading Every Breath You Take. I saw the movie first on Lifetime then I went and checked the book out from the library. The book is way better than the movie. I was also wondering how to access the website in memory of Jamie's wife Sheila and also where sheila's family is and how they are doing. How do you get feed back to these questions?>>By Diamonds   (Monday, 26 Jan 2004 00:59)Pages:  1 2
