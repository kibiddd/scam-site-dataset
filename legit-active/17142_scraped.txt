Families for Safe Streets
FSS confronts the epidemic of traffic violence by advocating for lifesaving changes and providing support to people impacted by crashes.Visit FSS
We need congestion pricing!When it goes into effect, congestion pricing will transform New York City overnight.There will be hundreds of thousands fewer cars and trucks driving through our neighborhoods and into the Manhattan tolling zone.This means more space for people to move around car-free, faster commute times for bus and bike riders, and cleaner air for everyone, inside and outside of the tolling zone. Congestion pricing is under attack. Take action today and tell Gov. Hochul: Don’t stall congestion pricing.
