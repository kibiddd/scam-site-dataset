NewsOn6.com TULSA, Oklahoma – The Tulsa Talons Arena Football team is relocating to San Antonio Texas.  The team made the announcement Monday and will be called the San Antonio Talons, keeping the same name as the Tulsa team that started in the AF2 developmental league in 2000.  The Talons will compete in the Alamodome and the inaugural season will begin in March of 2012 and last through August.  Nine home games will be played in the Alamodome and the team will travel for an additional nine games to face teams like Chicago, Jacksonville, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh and San Jose. "San Antonio is a great football town," Mayor Julián Castro said. "We've seen that with the UTSA Roadrunners and I'm confident we'll continue to see that with the AFL's Talons. By adding another attraction to the Alamodome, we are giving San Antonians more reasons to visit downtown, to patronize local restaurants and to boost the overall local economy." "The speed and excitement of this high scoring football league makes it enjoyable for the entire community, from NFL fans to those who just enjoy competitive entertainment," says Jason Lohe who heads the Majority ownership group, and acts as CEO and GM for the Franchise. "We also have made a conscious commitment to make this an affordable league so that it was accessible to the entire community."  The Talons missed the playoffs last season, and paid attendance fell to approximately 5,100 fans per game. In 2010, the Talons made the playoffs, but still only drew an average of nearly 6,600 fans.   Rob Yowell, President of the San Antonio Talons says that San Antonio was the obvious choice when the ownership team began to search for a new home for the franchise. "Not only does this great city desire a pro football presence, they deserve it," says Yowell. "We couldn't be more excited to make that a reality today."
