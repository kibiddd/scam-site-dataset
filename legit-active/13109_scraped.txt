Biography
One of the Ivy League’s most respected offensive lineman ... rarely misses an assignment and keeps the blocking front working as a cohesive unit ... has started 28 of 30 career games at center.
JUNIOR (2010)
Once again started all 10 games over the ball on the
offensive line ... key member of the front five that yielded just seven sacks all
season, the fourth fewest allowed in all of the FCS ... also contributed to the protection that allowed
Kempe to throw for 1,647 yards, the 15th most in a single season in
Dartmouth history ... equally adept at run blocking, helping to pave the
way for Nick Schwieger who became just the fourth Big Green back to
rush for 1,000 yards in a season and finished sixth nationally in
rushing yards per game.
SOPHOMORE (2009)
Most consistent blocker on the offensive front for the Big Green ... started all 10 contests at center and played nearly every down ... anchored a line that allowed two different backs break the school’s single-game rushing record in a three-game span ... huge factor in teammate Nick Schwieger leading the Ivy League in rushing average.
FRESHMAN (2008)
Earned the starting slot at center right out of preseason and started eight of the 10 varsity games ... performance against Colgate in the opener was a big reason for Alex Jenny’s 343-yard passing day.
HIGH SCHOOL
Played at perennial Long Island powerhouse St. Anthony’s with Big Green defensive back J.B. Andreassi ... captained team as a senior ... earned Daily News All-City and Newsday All-Long Island honors ... nominated for U.S. Army All-American Game ... chosen for New York-New Jersey Governors Bowl.
PERSONAL
Majoring in history ... son of Steven and Lucille ... born on August 24, 1989 ... brother Alex was a high school All-American recruited to Stanford by Buddy Teevens ... chose Dartmouth over major college scholarship offers ... father played football at Princeton from 1973-76 ... interested in film and TV studies.
