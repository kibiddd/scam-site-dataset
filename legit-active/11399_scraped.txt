When
You    Get A Little Lonely
Maureen's acclaimed
country  album includes the talent of
many of music's   top  session players  and writers:
Country-rock guitarist
Albert Lee ,  whom CD Review magazine   recently
called  "perhaps the finest country-rock   guitarist in the world,"
has    been a member of Emmylou Harris' legendary   Hot Band and has toured
with      Eric Clapton and the Everly Brothers.
Pianist Larry Knechtel
worked  with  Simon & Garfunkel   on their landmark album
"Bridge     Over  Troubled  Water."
Veteran bass player
Lee Sklar                 has  backed dozens of artists,
most notably Phil Collins  and Jackson Browne.
Steel guitar whiz
Jay Dee Maness                  also appears on the Grammy-nominated
new album by Country legend Rose Maddox.
Other well-known players
include                  Dan Dugmore (guitar and   steel guitar),
Craig Krampf (drums),                 Randy
Howard                     (fiddle), David Hungate   (bass) and
Barry    Beckett                 (B-3 organ).

Edwards            were backing Linda Ronstadt  on many of her  great
albums.

Larson,  Gretchen  Peters, Liz Hengbar,   Pam Tillis and Mike
Reid          are among the best.
