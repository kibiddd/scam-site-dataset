Stefon Diggs
NE
Wide Receiver
#1
Personalize your Rotoworld feed by favoriting players
Patriots signed WR Stefon Diggs, formerly of the Texans, to a three-year, $69 million contract.
ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Diggs’ contract includes $26 million guaranteed. The 31-year-old tore his ACL in Week 8 last season and may not be ready for Week 1. However, the Patriots needed a veteran wide receiver to add to a middling group that saw no wideouts over 700 receiving yards and just DeMario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte over 400 yards last season. Diggs was a Pro-Bowler and 1,000-yard receiver each season from 2020-2023 with the Bills and caught 47 passes for 497 yards and three touchdowns for the Texans in 2024. Still a top target-earner when healthy, Diggs will aid QB Drake Maye’s development while the Pats grow the offense. Fantasy managers can treat Diggs as a stash that will have fantasy WR2 upside as the season goes on.
Russell Wilson
NYG
Quarterback
#3
Giants signed QB Russell Wilson, formerly of the Steelers, to a one-year, $21 million contract.
Wilson has found a suitor in the Giants, signing a one-year deal worth up to $21 million, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The deal also includes $10.5 million guaranteed. The Giants were in the market for a veteran quarterback and now have two after also signing Jameis Winston. The dominos will continue to fall as the Steelers are still without a quarterback, though Aaron Rodgers seems destined for Pittsburgh despite the snail-like speed of his free agency decision. Meanwhile, Wilson is now poised to start for the Giants in 2025 after throwing for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions in 11 games for the Steelers last season. The ceiling for Malik Nabers and the Giants’ pass-catchers is lower with Wilson than Winston and the addition of the two veteran quarterbacks indicates the team will either pick a rookie to sit the entire 2025 season, or wait until the 2026 draft to add a rookie quarterback.
Cam Ward
FA
Quarterback
#7
ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Titans will hold an additional private workout with Miami QB Cam Ward.
“The Titans have become increasingly impressed with Ward and, while they are expected to listen to offers for the No. 1 overall pick, it now would take an even stronger package to acquire the draft’s top selection,” Schefter says. This is quickly barrelling into either consensus No. 1 overall pick territory or one of the great rug pulls of all-time to try to generate more trade interest for the selection. We’d bet on the former given how exuberant the praise from Titans staff has become. If the Titans bring some of their own offensive players to this private workout it will likely be a glaring neon sign that Ward is going No. 1 overall.
Shedeur Sanders
Quarterback
ESPN’s Adam Schefter believes even if the Giants sign Russell Wilson, they may select Shedeur Sanders at No. 3 overall.
The links between the Giants and Sanders have been obvious since the 2024 season was left for dead in November. Schefter points out that he had New York Giants cleats on before the Alamo Bowl. It certainly would appear that the Giants at No. 3 should be an unsurprising outcome for Sanders in this draft. Assuming the Titans select Cam Ward No. 1 overall — which certainly appears to be the consensus right now — the Browns will probably have to take Sanders at 2 if they want him.
Jaleel McLaughlin
DEN
Running Back
#38
The Athletic’s Nick Kosmider believes the Broncos could target a pass-catching running back in the 2025 NFL Draft.
Broncos head coach Sean Payton has long deployed running backs as a key part of his passing offense. That didn’t change in 2024, with a quarter of early-down pass attempts going to Denver backs. That Jaleel McLaughlin and Javonte Williams proved to be among the least efficient pass-catching backs in the NFL last season has left the Broncos with a need to fill this offseason. They parted with Williams, who signed with Dallas. Payton seemed not to trust McLaughlin with the pass-catching role in 2024, and for good reason: McLaughlin ranked 54th out of 57 qualifying running backs in yards per route run. “It all creates major questions about how the Broncos will address a critical part of their offense,” Kosmider said. "[The Broncos] have closely evaluated what experts call one of the deeper running back classes in recent memory. They allotted many of their allowed meetings with prospects at the combine to the position and will continue to monitor the group at pro days around the country this month. They’ll meet with more running backs at their facility during top-30 visits.” Denver holds the 20th pick in the first round of the 2025 draft.
J.J. McCarthy
MIN
Quarterback
#9
J.J. McCarthy said the Vikings have not told him he’ll be the team’s starting quarterback in 2025.
McCarthy told Kay Adams on Monday that Minnesota coaches had not named him the starter after the team said last week it would not pursue Aaron Rodgers “at this time.” Coming off a knee injury that cost him his entire rookie campaign, McCarthy appears to be the favorite for the team’s Week 1 starting job. His recovery and performance in training camp could complicate things, however. NFL Network reported last week that the Vikings had rejected trade calls for McCarthy this offseason. McCarthy would certainly be set up for success in Kevin O’Connell’s quarterback-friendly system: The pass-catching trio of Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, and TJ Hockenson is one of the best in the league.
Leki Fotu
LV
Defensive Tackle
#92
Raiders signed DT Leki Fotu, formerly of the Jets.
Fotu visited with both the Raiders and Bills this offseason before ultimately deciding to join the Raiders. The fifth-year vet was limited to just two games last year due to injuries, but he started nine of the 11 games he appeared in for the Cardinals in 2023, where he recorded 28 tackles and 2.5 sacks. Fotu is a former fourth-round pick who has 22 starts under his belt. He’ll join a defensive line that is hoping to have last year’s hot free agent, Christian Wilkins, back and healthy following an injury-plagued 2024 season.
Tony Jefferson
LAC
Safety
#23
Chargers re-signed S Tony Jefferson to a one-year contract.
Jefferson un-retired in 2024 and joined the Chargers on a one-year deal. He ended up opening the year on the practice squad but was later signed to the active roster. He would go on to appear in eight regular season games while making four starts and racked up 27 tackles and one TFL in limited action. The team’s decision to bring him back doesn’t mean he’ll be a lock to make the 53-man roster. Jefferson will likely still have to compete for a spot in training camp.
Travis Hunter
FA
Defensive Back
Patriots GM Eliot Wolf said the team will take the “best player available” in next month’s draft.
It’s not the first time Wolf has suggested this, but speaking in front of season ticket holders over the weekend, the Patriots GM doubled down on a line he said earlier this offseason at the scouting combine. According to Wolf, the team “filled a lot of needs already in free agency,” which he hopes will allow them to take the BPA in next month’s draft. The Patriots hold the No. 4 overall pick in the draft, which could give them a chance to land Colorado WR/CB Travis Hunter, who could fill multiple needs wherever he ends up. If they were drafting for need, they’d likely settle on a left tackle at No. 4 overall.
Tetairoa McMillan
FA
Wide Receiver
The Athletic’s Matt Schneidman predicts the Packers “break the 22-year streak and take a wide receiver in the first round” of this year’s draft.
As Schneidman points out, Packers GM Brian Gutekunst was the only GM to appear at a private workout for Arizona’s Tetairoa McMillan. McMillan is currently ranked as the No. 7 prospect on Dane Brugler’s top 100 and could become the first wide receiver drafted in the first round by the Packers since they took Javon Walker in 2002. McMillan may not fall to the Packers, who currently hold the No. 23 overall pick in the draft, necessitating a trade up. But in a draft that could feature three or four first-round picks at the position, Green Bay should have options if they want to upgrade at receiver.
