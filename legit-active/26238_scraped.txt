Prodege has been a valuable asset in helping to prove BuzzFeed’s effectiveness. The quick turnaround of results within the Data Viz platform has allowed us to better service our advertising partners in delivering valuable campaign insights. The self-serve platform gives us the flexibility to format and export in a way that meets our specific needs. Prodege has even gone the extra mile and customized the PowerPoint slides to use our unique color scheme and layout.
The peeq platform empowers my Audience Insights team with agility that is vital to deeply understand a rapidly changing consumer landscape. The seamless system allows us to tease out nuanced behaviors, triggers, and need states for each of our clients and categories, and cuts analytics time down to a fraction of what it once was.
