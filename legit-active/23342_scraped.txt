Read:  Our Disclaimer
This website contains ideas and materials for those with at least half a brain. That means being able to read, appreciate language, subscribe to the "sticks and stones" philosophy, and have functioning genitalia — or a note from your mother to that effect.
If you qualify, enter. If you are an imbecile, a eunuch, an inveterate churchgoer, or possessed by a morbid fear of words — run, don't walk away from us now. Hit the goodbye button and have a nice day.
