Telus BlackBerry Tour and Storm Wonâ€™t Play Nice With Upcoming HSPA Network

So letâ€™s say youâ€™re a Telus customer sporting a BlackBerry Storm and Tourâ€¦ Both devices work just swimmingly on the Telus network, and youâ€™re happy. But what happens when Telus launches their new HSPA network? According to a leaked internal document dated in late July:
â€˜Please note that our current line up of HSPA devices wonâ€™t be compatible with the Canadian HSPA network. When the HSPA Network launches, Telus will be providing a new HSPA line up of devices that will work on that Networkâ€™
So what does it all mean? In a nutshell, if youâ€™re a Telus Storm or Tour user, youâ€™ll need to upgrade to a new-and-improved device to take advantage of the new network when it arrivesâ€¦ Itâ€™s that, or stick with what youâ€™ve got and enjoy slower speeds. Enjoy slower speeds? That sounds odd. ðŸ™‚
