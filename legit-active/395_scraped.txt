INTERSTATE
29
Interstate 29 runs
from downtown Kansas City, Missouri, at Interstate 70 to the
Canada border near Pembina, North Dakota. It skirts the western
edges of Missouri and Iowa, then runs along the eastern edges of
North Dakota and South Dakota. Interstate 29's exit numbering
begins after the highway leaves its duplex with Interstate 35,
however, the interstate is signed from Interstate 70, five miles
to the south of the split with Interstate 35. There is an
"Interstate 29 Ends" sign just north of the Interstate
70 interchange.
