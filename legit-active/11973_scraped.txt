He Looks a bit more fit then when he did Pet Star, but still has a great, shape. I wish he would take off even more on Pet Star, like wear nice shorts or something. He's soo FINE, almost my age! LOL wow, huh? I hope he does the sitcom "10 years SLater" NBC Entertainment and finished that soccerr movie he's staring in this sitcom where he's the high school football coach dealing with some students thinking that he is gay (although I think he would make a great gay, or bi, guy). He's also commentating on a sports show on ESPN2, but looks too conservative there buecase he always has on a nice suite and sports coat. he's got a nice package in there though.cbolterSep 7, 2005PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateJuly 2004 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishFilming locationsBurbank, California, USAProduction companyMindless EntertainmentSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the English language plot outline for Extreme Dodgeball (2004)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
