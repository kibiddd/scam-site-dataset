jones and de gea would not join their teammates until the 15th..maybe de gea a few days later, because he was involved in the u-21s until the very end.
ashley young should start.

I've heard A. Young's been looking sharp in training. I'm sure he'll be eager to make a big impression.

It'll be great to have so many players taking part in pre season games with a full summers rest. No world cups or long term injuries (touchwood) to worry about. Especially looking forward to seeing Evra, Anderson, and Rooney getting a full pre season and hitting the ground running right away. Will be exciting also to see all of our new signings, but then that will be cancelled out a bit by the players that have left us. Will be so strange not having Scholes taking the piss in these matches

Sneijder to make a surprise appearance 5 minutes before time. Gets destroyed by a two footed tackle, out for the season...
On second thought... Let's wait a bit before his introduction..

Thinking about friendlies reminded me of the fact that Wes and O'Shea haven't had the chance to say goodbye.  They're two long standing servants of the club - will they get testimonials?

Amidst squeaky bums.
Lindegaard, Amos, Johnstone
Rafael, Fabio, Ferdinand, Vidic, J Evans, Evra
Nani, Giggs, Young, Obertan, Carrick, Anderson, Park
Rooney, Berbatov, Owen, Macheda, Diouf
Lindegaard, Rafael, Ferdinand, J Evans, Fabio, Nani, Carrick, Giggs, Young, Rooney, Berbatov.
And then we'll probably see Evra, Obertan, Anderson, Owen and Macheda at some point. This is all a stab in the dark though of course.

I imagine every player will play, except for the 3rd keeper.

Well, VDS gets one from Ajax, so I guess we would do the same when they retire.

I'm not saying I'd play him there in the league, but he can surely fill in there if need be, especially against MLS sides.
