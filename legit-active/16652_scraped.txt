VAF   EORHE
Jan  (?brnelis  Van  Eoorn  was  the  founder  of
tiais  Van  Horne  family  in  America.  The  tirae  of
his  arrival  is  not  known,  "but  he  was  in  ITev/  Amster-
dam (ITew  York)  as  early  as  1645.  He  came  from  the
Cit3''  of  Koorn,  Holland.  He  was  a  man  of  means  said
of  superior  education,  ranking  high  in  the  astina,-
tion  of  his  church  and  with  his  fellows;  we  find
him  o\7nincj  several  pa.rcels  of  real  estate  and  his
signature,  Oct.  4,  1647  Jan  Cornellessen  Van  Hoorn
is  attached  to  a  Power  of  AtGorne;/,  on  file  among
the  old  Dutch  records,  l^ew  York,  giving  authority
to  Jan  Jansen,  cheesemonger  of  ITew  Amsterdam,  auth-
orising said  Jansen  to  receive  and  receipt  for  the
income  due  said  Jan  Cornellessen  Van  ?Ioorn  at  Arri-
sterdam,  Holland.  His  name  signed  "by  him  writ-
ten and  spelled  in  1654  as  above,  is  still  in  a
state  of  good  preservation.
Jan  Cornells  prospered,  hi  a  children  pros-
pered and  were  honored  "by  their  fellow  citizens  ,and
prosperity  and  honor  came  to  their  descendants,
reaching,  its  zenith  a'oout  the  days  of  the  Revolu-
tion.
It  is  problematical  if  Jan  Cornelius  Van
Hoorn  was  of  the  old  Van  Hoorn  family  of  Holland  or
whether  he  viras  simply  Jan  Cornelius  Van  .Eoorn  ,';7hich
translated  means  £ohxi.,  the  son  of  Cornelius^  from
Hoor2i.  ITearly  all  the  immigrants  ••ifh.o  cajne  to  Hew
ITetherland,  had  no  other  name  than  of  such  forms  as
the  following:-  Jan  Cornells,  which  means  John, the
son  of  Cornelius  --  Jan  Cornellissen ,  which  means
John,  the  son  of  Cornelius  who  was  the  son  of  Cor-
nelius; another  illustration  is  Peter  Peters , which
means  Peter,  the  son  of  Peter  --  Peter  Peterssen,
which  means  Peter,  the  son  of  Peter,  who  was  the
son  of  Peter.  This  method  of  distinguishing  the
children  of  the  family  amongst  the  common  people  in
Holland,  had  gone  on  for  centuries,  and  it  was  only
when  one  of  the   common  people  rose  above   his  sur-
VAN   H  0  R  l-I  E
roundings  and  performed   some  particular   service
that  he  toolc  a  surname.
On  the  23rd  of  June ,  1645  ,  he  was  granted
two  lots  of  land  and  on  same  day  he  sold  a  house
and  lot  south  of  Marketf ield  Street ,  50  feet  wide
by  4  1/2  rods  long,  being  part  of  the  premises  pat-
ented to  said  Jan  Cornellissen  Van  Hoorn.
Jan  Cornelissen  sells  and  gives  deed  of  a
lot  on  the  Island  of  Kanliattan ,  with  a  bill  of  Sur-
vey, to  Albert  Pietersen,  Trucipeter  ,  Peb.  22,  1649.
On  Farch  5th,  1653,  Jan  Cornellissen  Van
Honrn  sold  a  lot  on  east  side  of  Port  Arnsterdam  one
and  one  half  rods  ajid  lour  and  one  half  inches  ,  by
nine  rods  and  nine  feet  in  length  near  Marketf ield
Street.  The  fort  stood  on  the  Hudson  River  front-
ing tile  Battery,  hence  tMs  lot  to  the  east  of  it.
April  20,1561,  Jan  Cornelisa  bought  of  Abra-
ham Pietersen  at  rev;  Ansterdam,  a  water  mill  on
fresh  water.
In  a  remonstrance  of  the  People  of  the  ITew
iNFether lands  to  the  Director  General  and  Council, no.f
in  the  Royal  Archives  at  the  Hague,  dated  September
?,  1664,  in  which  we  find  the  name  of  Jan  Cornelia
Van  Hoorn.
He  ^.fas  oriQ  of  the  remonstrants  ags.inst  de-
fending the  ciuy  -rhen  attacked  by  the  English  in
1664,  and  signs  the  petition  to  the  Director  Gen-
eral and  Council,  asking  that  the  City  may  be  sur-
rendered to  the  English  September  5,  1654.
In  October  of  that  year,  he  took  the  oath  of
allegiance  to  the  King  of  England.  He  became  a
member  of  the  First  Dutch  Church  of  New  York  City
October  3th.
On  April  fourteenth,  1657,  Jan  Gornellisssn
Van  Hoorn  was  entered  upon  the  rolls  of  the  i nimbi -
tants  oil  ITew  Amsterdam  aa  a  small  burgher;  he  must
pay  25  guilders  and  have  been  a  resident  tlirae
years  and  six  weeks  before  the  date  of  the  city
charter .
Jan  Cornelissen  Van  Horn  was   the   thii'd
V  A  IT   H  0  R  IT  E
teacher  of  the  Public  School  of  the  Dutch  Church,
'E.  y.  after  its  organization,  beginning  his  duties
some  time  in  1648,  and  continuing  up  to  November
1650,  about  which  time  he  resigned.
His  occupation  as  teacher  was  in  a  sense  an
ecclesiastical  position  recognized  by  church  and
state .
He  married  Hilleronda  Joris,  it  appears  that
he  died  before  June  16th,  1669,  as  on  this  day  his
widow  married  Evert  Pstersen,  the  widov?er  of  Griet-
je  Arents.
The  follov/inc  Court  Records  are  of  interest.
Tuesday,  }?ov»  4,  1659.  In  the  City  Hall

Van  Hoorn,  deft.  Pltf.  deraanda  of  Deft.  a  Muff
brought  to  riim  by  his  wif e  ,to  have  it  made  smaller,
which  he  spoiled;  requests  paj-n.ent  or  that  the
muff  be  returned.  Deft,  says,  his  wife  left  the
muff  to  be  made  smaller  and  narrower ,  that  he  did
not  cut  it  of f J  to  wit,  in  the  length,  but  took  it
in.  Plf-  replies  saj'-ing ,  tliat  his  v/ife  said  to
him  --  Jan  Cornelissen,  we  vfish  you  to  make  the
muff  smaller  nor  larger,  but  leave  it  as  it  is.
Deft.  denies  it.  The  Court  refer  the  matter  in
question  to  Jacob  Strj'-cker  and  Isaacq  Kip  to  exam-
ine, whether  the  muff  be  spoiled,  if  not  spoiled  to
estiiiiate  it:  to  reconcile  parties  if  possible ;  och-

Richard  Walton  of  Staten  Island,  kinsmen  Jacoh
and  William  ?/alton,  William  Walton,  son  of
Thomas  Walton,  god-son  Jacob  Walton,  son  of

er William  Walton  to  be  guardian  of  her  daugh-
ter Elisabeth  and  in  case. of  his  death  my  nep-
hew William  Walton,  Jr.,  son  of  said  brother.
The  children  named  in  following  order.
lo  Violetta,  wife  of  Edward  Kicks.
2.  Mary,  v/ife  of  Cortlandt  (Stephen).
3.  Elizabeth,  i'-oungest  daughter  and  un-
married in  1740  o
4.  William,  not  of  age  at  date  of  will.
These  children  were  all  mentioned  in  her
husband's  will.  This  unquestionable  record
from  the  probate  Courts  establishes  clearly
the  family  history  of  Ricketts  for  three  gen-
erations, and  utterly  disproves  the  assump-
tion that  V/illiam  Rickett's  (II)  wife  was  the
daughter  of  William  and  Maria  De  Lancey  Vxal-
ton.
Who  then  was  Mary  ,  wife ,  1712  ,  of  Will-
iam Ricketts  *>  There  were  Waltons  on  Staten
Island,  and  it  has  been  conjectured  by  Stevens
who  wrote  about  "The  Waltons  of  New  York"  that
Thomas  of  Staten  Island  was  father  of  V/illiajn
the  founder  of  the  Kev;  York  family.  This
Thomas  married  a  Iv.iss  Lav/rence  whose  ma,rria,'7e
license  is  dated  December  16,  1671.  William
who  married  Maryeen  Santvoort  September  7^
1698  ,  might  liave  been  so  far  as  dates  are  con-
cerned their  son.  William's  children  were
Thomas  1699,  Maria  1701,  Jacob  1703,  Will-
iam 1705,  Jacobeus  1709,  James  1711 ^  Abraham
1714.

was  not  the  Maria  above  ia  clear  for  she
would  hare  been  but  eleyen  years  old  in  1712.
But  her  will  mentions  her  nephews  Abraham  and
Matthew  V/alton  ,and  her  kinsmen  Jacob  and  Will-
iam Walton,  her  god-son  Jacob,  son  of  Jacob
V^alton  ,  grandson  Philip  Cortlandt  ,  her  brother
¥/illiaci  Walton,  her  nephew  William  Walton,  Jr,
But  in  1740  v^hen  itary  (Walton)  Ricketts  made
her  Yvill  J  the  only  Williaia  who  was  a  son  of  a
William,  "vas  he  who  married  Cornelia  Eeeicman
in  1731.  His  father  was  the  Captain  William
Walton  v7ho  had  the  monopol}''  of  trade  with  the
Spaniards  at  St.  Auguetixie,  Florida,  and  the
West  Indies  and  founded  the  fortunes  of  the
family.  Prom  the  docunents  at  hand  it  appears
that  Mary  (Walton)  Ricketts  was  hia  sister.
The  dates,  the  names  mentioned  in  the  wills,
the  allusion  to  property  on  Staten  Island, seem
to  make  this  clear.
iiary  (Walton)  Ricketts  instead  of  beiiig
the  daughter  of  William  Walton  by  his  wife
Maria  De  Lancey  was  actually  the  sister  of  his
grandfather .

The  storj?-  of  the  ao  called  (AnBatje),  (Ann)  _,
Annecke  Jans  claim,  of  which  Trinity  Church  Cor-.'
poration  of  New  York,  has  been  the  ta:eget  ^  is  as
follows:-
Annecke  Jans  first  appears  in  "Mow  Fotherland
(New  York)  J  as  the  wife  of  P.oeiof  Jansen;  7/ho  her
parents  were,,  or  where  she  cajne  from,,  is  not  die
closed  to  us  in  ans'  records  ,  except  that  her  mother
WB.a  a  Eiidwife.  They  first  lived  at  Rensselaerwick,
where  he  'forked  as  a  famer  ,  for  180  Guilder?;  per
year.  In  1636  he  moved  to  ITew  Amsterdam  (Nev;  "i  ork
City)  and  died  within  a  year,  leavinj  a  -widow  and
five  young  children.
His  widoWj  Annecke  Jana  ,  married  second,  Re/«
Evardus  Eogardus  about  March,  1638.  He  './ac;  Domine
of  the  IXitch  Church,  Hew  Amsterdam,  (iTev/  York
City).  She  died  in  1663,  at  Eeverw^yck  (Albany.
?T,  Y.).  To  her  children  and  grand  cMlaren  she
willed  January  29,.  1663,  all  of  her  property,  to
be  divided  equally  among  tliem,  on  condition  t}^t
the   four      named   should  receive  1,000   Guilders      from
the  proceeds  of  the  farm  which  she  owried  on  the
North      (Hudson)      River,     fenhattan      Islands  This
farm,  called  the  "Dominies  Bowery,"  contained
sixty -two  acres,  and  was  granted  origin?,  liy  to
Roelof  Jansan,  her  first  husband,  in  1635;  coa-
firmed  to  his  widow  and  heirs  in  1654,  and  again  to
the  latter  in  1667.  On  the  9th  of 'karch ,  1671,
William  3oe;ardus  for  himself  and  brothers,  Jan  and
Jonas,,  and  two  of  Annecke  Jans'  s  cns-irt-la-.'v  (acting
in  right  of  their  wives  and  by  an  assigiiment  of
Peter  Bogardus)  conveyed  this  property?-  to  C"ol«

whom  it  is  inferred  t>ie  title  passed  to"  the  Duke

part  of  wZoat  was  swccessiYely  called  '"The  Dulce's
Parm,"  "The  Kini::'s  Farm.."  and  "The  Queen's  Farm."-
In  the  year  1705,  this  last  was  conveyed  by  Letters
Patent  under  the  great  seal  of  the  Province,,  to  the
Corporation  of  Trinity  Church,  Few  York,,  in  whose
possession  it  has  since  for  the  most  part  "been.

Broadway,  only  from  Warren  Street  to  Duane  Street,
One  heir,.  Cornelius  Bogardus,  not  having  "been  a

heirs  have  claimed  a  share  of  this  extensive  prop-
erty,, the  prosecution  of  vhich  has  formed  the  sub-'
ject  of  many  cunning  and  some  fanciful  suits,
"brought  by  heirs  against  the  Corporation  of  Trinity
Churchy  each  suit  ending  vdth  decisions  which  pro-
claimed the  honesty  of  tiie  Church  Corporation  in
its  acquirement  and  ovmership  of  this  eixty-two  acre

of  the  Mono  Vice  Chanc  Sanford  in  re  Bogardus  et
al.  vs.  Trinity  Church,.  Hew  York,  1847,,  8  Vol.  ppo
40).  ITo  one,  as  an  heir  of  Annecke  Jans,  had  a
particle  of  ov/nership  in  this  sixty-two  acres  for
many  years  before  it  came  into  the  possession  of
the  Corporation  of  Trinity  Church,  and  no  one,  as
an.  heir,,  or  attorney  for  heirs,,  lias  ever  been  able
to  distur"b  the  title.  It  is  not  in  evidence  that
any  of  the  Van  Horn  or  Van  Home  families  ^  ever  had
a  cent's  worth  of  interest  in  the  property  of  Ann~
ecke  Jans,  as   her   direct   rieirs  ,  at   any   time.
The     foregoing     story   of  the     possession  of
Annecke  Jans  is  proved  by  the  Court  records  from
evidences  f^iven  at  the  various  trials  of  tlie  suits
mentioned.  It  utterly  refutes  much  that  has  been
printed  in  connection  with  Annecke  Jans'    property."
The      story      of     the      so    called      "Lord     Waldron
Claim"   runs  as    follows:-

In  the  year  1633,  King  T^filliam  the  fourtli^  of
Holland,  kno^m  in  History'-  as  William  the  Silent,
PrincP  of  'JTPVge  ,  ga.v'i  a  grant  of  S7  .800  acres  of"
land  in  ITev^  York  Province,  known  as  Harlem  Plat  Bo
Thia  origiaial  grant  w^b  -.irritten  on  four  large  skina
of  the  finest  TelluiR  or  parchment,  the  writing  was
in  deep  black  and  appeared  as  fresh  and  unfaded  as
as    if  laade    yesterda^yo
The  "be -inning  of  each  paragraph  y^as  one  of  the
elaborate  capitals,  such  as  are  seen  in  the  old
Monkish  Latin  writings o  The  four  sheets  or  skina
were  connected  at  the  top  ty  e^^-eleta  ,  with  a  purple
ri"bbon  pasaiag  throu^^h  them,  bringing  the  er.d^
together  J  which  were  sealed  with  wax,  bearing  the
impress  of  the  great  seal  of  the  King  of  Holland.
The  whole  document  was  rolled  on  a  stick  of  dark
wood  and  dsposited   in  a  box  of     stamped  Spanish
leather.
Tlxis  grant  vm,s  giver  to  Lord  Waldron  and  four
others,  which  number  was  increased  in  3686,  to
twenty-three,  the  additional  persons  consisting  of
sons,  daughters  and  sons-in-law.  The  entire  px'op~
erty  was  willed  to  the  fifth  generation  of  the
second  grantees  and  the  sixth  generation  of  the
first  grantees.  The  generations  are  now  extinct
in  the  Van  Harne  family.  Brery  inch  of  this  land
has  lawfully  passed  fro.Ti  one  owner  to  another  ^
tlierefore,  ths  present  owners  hold  titles  which
cannot   be    successfully  assailed.
Of  the  IP'olford  Webber  "Claims,"  so  called,  the
propertj'-  originally  comprising  them  passed  from  the
heirs  beyond  all  hopes  of  recoYerVj  so  .me  seventy-
five  years  ago.  This  last  estate,  which  wag  in
Holland,  \ma  ciade  the  subject  of  inquiry  by  the
then,   Secretary   of  State   at   Washington.  The      re-
sult of  his  investigation  showed  that  the  authori-
ties of  Holland  jiad  advertised  for  claimants  to
this  estate,  declaring  that  after  a  certain  number
of  years  J     all  unclaimed  estates   should  revert        to

the  Government  of  Holland.  At  the  time  this  in-
quiry was  made  these  years  had  long;  since  elapsed,
and  the  property  ha,d  passed  into  the  posseasion  of
the  Government  and  was  be^^ond  the  reach  of  any
clairaant  „  This  claim  gre-v  out  of  the  fact  that
Wolford  V/ebber  of  Holland  married  Annaka  Coch^
daughter  of  Hendrick  and  ITeisgen  Sel&yns  Coch,
the;.'  had  but  one  son  named
Wolford  Anient  V/ebber  b.  came  to
America  1609.  This  Wolford  Ament  ^yebber  married
Gertrude  Hassing  by  whom  he  had  two  daughters ^
Kelegona  and  Rachel.  Helegona  ma,rried  Philip  Min"
thorn  in  the  year  1696.
Wolford  Anent  Webber  died  in  1715,  leaving  a
Will  bequeathing  his  property  to  his  d^ui^hter
Helegona,  and  to  his  other  daughter  Rachel,  who
married  Jolm  Vem  Horn.  Minthorn  v/as  maae  Executor
but  owing  to  the  dan;3er  of  sea  voya«;ee  in  those
days,  feared  to  cross  the  ocean,  but  Bogardus,
Annake  Jane'  second  husband,  undertook  to  act  for
hiia,  and  sailed  for  Holland,  August  10,  1647  on  the
ship  "Princess."  She  \7as  navigated  bj'  mi^j-take  in-
to the  Eritish  Channel,  struck  upon  a  reck  and  was
wrecked  upon  the  coast  of  Wales;  Eighty -one  per-
sons, including  Bogardus  were  drowned,  so  the  mat-
ter was  dropped.
The  canter  of  activity  in  regard  to  the  Van
Horn  "Clairis"  now  seems  to  be  in  Pennsylvania;  the
point  of  attack  being  a  large  tract  of  land  said  to
have  been  owned  at  one  time  by  Abraham  Van  Horns*
It  is  to  be  regretted  that  an^^  modern  Van  Horn  does
not  give  his  ancestor  credit  for  the  hard  headed-
ness  he  was  known  to  possess.  The  Van  Horn's  and
Van  Home's  of  Hev/  York  City,  in  early  days  were
noted  for  their  wealth  e-nd  good  business  sense,  and
it  is  absurd  to  assume  tliat  the  heirs  of  Abrtun  Van
Home  did  not  know  of  his  possessions.  The  real
estate  of  Abraham  Van  Home ,  passed  from  him  by
legal  title,  in  the  regular  way.
