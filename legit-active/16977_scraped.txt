What is the Mouth-Body ConnectionÂ® ?
The Mouth-Body ConnectionÂ® refers to the link between oral health and overall health, and the role that the harmful bacteria and inflammation in our mouths play in chronic, systemic disease. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s time we talked about more than your teeth. Our office prioritizes your overall health as it relates to your oral health. When we care for your smile weâ€™re also looking out for your entire self.
