When it explodes, it does so in devastating fashion, only to close over again and re-engage once more with its underlying tensions. Its sexually explicit scenes, more than 90 minutes into the movie, come as an abrupt, intense contrast to the restraint and oblique pressures that have gone before. Yet there is nothing gratuitous about them: they are essential to the film. It's a movie about desire and brutality and how closely they can co-exist. It's about deception, and what it can reveal as well as what it can conceal. And it's about the nature of performance and what it, too, can hide and at the same time lay bare. Its setting is a politically turbulent location on the cusp of change, but the politics in this film are inextricably bound up with the personal. It is based on a story by Eileen Chang, about Chia Chi, a young woman in World War II Shanghai who is caught up in a dangerous game. Chang, a popular writer of the 1940s, who spent the last half of her life in America, drew on some of her own experiences in occupied Shanghai, where her first husband was a collaborator with the Japanese forces. Lust, Caution was written late in her life; she began it in 1950, but did not finish it until 1979. Chia Chi (chameleon-like newcomer Tang Wei) is an actress, as Chang describes her in the story, "playing her part, in a drama too secret to make her famous". She has been given the task, by her student comrades, of seducing Mr Yee, a leading collaborator who is in charge of security. In the story, he's a squat man in his 50s: Lee has cast the stellar Tony Leung Chiu Wai, an actor who can convey an extraordinary range of emotions with the barest flicker of an eyebrow. It's a subtle, minimalist portrait of a man whose motives remain shadowy, whose power depends on a combination of overt activity and torture. Chia Chi is a solitary young woman without ties. An unexpressed crush on a student activist leads her to join his theatre group. She demonstrates a talent on stage: it takes her by surprise as much as anyone else. And then she's given a far more demanding role: she must turn herself into a brittle, elegant and knowing young woman who can move in the circles that Mr Yee and his wife (Joan Chen) frequent. If she can seduce him, she can make him an assassination target for the naive young activists, who are Nationalists, rather than Communists, although the film does not make much of this. AdvertisementDifferent kinds of performance, from everyday hypocrisies to rousing propaganda theatre to political intrigue to Hitchcock roles, are threaded through the film. Chia Chi goes to the movies several times: the cinema is a place of identification and escape where she sees Hollywood films, and also a place of darkness where conspirators meet. There is a compelling scene, towards the end of the film, in which Chia Chi sings a song for Mr Yee during an assignation in a Japanese tavern in the city. It comes from a 1935 movie called Street Angel: it was sung by Zhou Xuan, a popular, brittle performer whose life ended with a tragic breakdown. It's a complex moment in which Chia Chi loses herself in a performance of cultural, national and sexual identity. Her role-playing puts her in extreme danger. She is also discovering something about herself, even as she is risking her life. The film is full of ambiguities about knowledge and awareness, and whether people choose to act on what they recognise. When choices are made, ambiguities remain, uncertainties about motive, emotion, knowledge, intention. Lust, Caution is an unsettling, powerful and profoundly haunting film.SaveLog in, register or subscribe to save articles for later.License this articleMost Viewed in CultureLoadingFrom our partnersLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentAdvertisementThe AgeTwitterFacebookInstagramRSSOur SitesThe AgeThe Sydney Morning HeraldBrisbane TimesWAtodayThe Australian Financial ReviewDomainDriveClassifiedsTributesCelebrationsPlace your adCommercial Real EstateThe AgeContact & supportAdvertise with usNewslettersAccessibility guideSitemapPhoto salesPurchase front pagesContent licensingWork with usTerms of usePrivacy policyPress CouncilCharter of Editorial IndependenceAI Editorial GuidelinesProducts & ServicesSubscription packagesMy accountSubscriber FAQsDelivery statusToday’s PaperGood Food GuideDaily PuzzlesCopyright © 2025Subscribe
