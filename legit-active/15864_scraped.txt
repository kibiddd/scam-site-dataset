McGill University is on land which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst Indigenous peoples, including the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabeg nations. We acknowledge and thank the diverse Indigenous peoples whose footsteps have marked this territory on which peoples of the world now gather.
For more information about traditional territory and tips on how to make a land acknowledgement, visit our Land Acknowledgement webpage.
