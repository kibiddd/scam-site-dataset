YOU are dearly missed and we celebrate you and keep your loving, humorous spirit alive through our memories and how you touched our hearts.  May you rest in peace and may your family have peace too.

God Bless you and we keep you in our prayer's.  Smiles and Love, LoriChristina DemersFebruary 26, 2009Happy belated birthday Lenny!!  I think of you often....Love, TinaLoriFebruary 19, 2009Dear Kathleen and Carl....so so so sorry for your loss again and again....remember that the guest book is here for you and for or a year so people can share memories of your darling, one-in-a-million, son...too often, after one's passing...everyone is there for the initial memorial and service.. and then they are gone....the family needs friends and memories more and more as the year passes, (in my opinion anyway) the shock starts to  wear off and sadness and grief set in...YOUR gift of Len to this world was indescribable and no other human will ever compare to your Lenny..he brought humor, wisdom, hope, peace and, yes, even a bit of "quirk-e-ness" to those whom knew him..only in great ways and with tons of fondness and admiration.  He was hilarious...God Bless you and the rest of your family...KNOW Len lives through each of you...especially his MOM, Kathleen, whom he adored ever, ever soooo much! God Bless and Hope to talk with you soon.  Happy Birthday Len, 2/21!! Tink! to you! I know you are dancing in heaven!Rhonda (Berndt) KoppFebruary 16, 2009I have just learned of Len's passing today.  Len and I were friends in college.  We kept in contact for several years after, then, as much too often happens, we lost touch.  I enjoyed his sense of humor, his intelligence.  We exchanged music and I still have a cassette tape he made for me many years ago, he titled "Real Music", because he always gave me grief for the music I listened to.  To the family, I am so sorry of your loss.LoriFebruary 6, 2009Happy February Len!  It is your birthday month (Tink! To You!)...we all loved celebration's, especially w/you...too fun and always an interesting, humorous twist in conversation and perspective...YOU were one of a kind!...and then some. :-)It is Steve Bailey's birthday  today and he, Deb and I talk of you often...we will toast Steve and know you are there in spirit and w/blessing's...He too misses you and struggles that he cannot just call you and talk...send him a special bday message if you can... know how very much you are missed by us all, and mostly your family!!!! You live through all of the hearts you touched... Thank you for making us better people just in knowing YOU and Thanks for being born! Happy Birthday Month to you!...LoriLoriJanuary 15, 2009Dear Len!  Happy New Year!   You are missing sub-zero record-making-history temp's here in MN..at least there is not this crazy cold weather (nor tears, or pain ) where you are.  We miss you and I hope you know and can hear all that are thinking of you, talking to you, sharing stories of you and just plain MISSING YOU! Why did you have to leave so early?? Darn it..Keep singing with the angels and know you are loved and really, really missed. I am so happy to have heard your voice on your cell phone in the past month....it brought me comfort, a few of us called and listened to you!    Love to your family, and send them extra Blessing's, they are struggling with missing you, of course! Much Love and Many Memories of your Smile, humor and friendship!December 25, 2008Lenny (you will always be Lenny to us),Our memories from all our childhood vacations will never be forgotten.  Tina tunafish, Rennie-Wennie....we don't know why you had such a talent for tormenting, but you succeeded.  Looking at all your pictures it seems that it should not have ended so soon. You are in our thoughts and prayers constantly.  Merry Christmas,Love your cousins from Illinois,Tina-Tunafish & Rennie-Wennie(Tina & Renee)Christopher NaltyDecember 18, 2008I am sorry to hear of your loss of Lenny. We will keep you in our prayers.JackieDecember 10, 2008I just heard of this sad news last night and am so deeply sorry for your loss.  I last saw Len a few months ago and we had such a fun time just talking about anything and everything.  He was definitely one of the kindest men I've met.  I think back to that conversation and the thoughts he shared on life.    Without a doubt, his words said more and have a deeper meaning than I ever thought they would.  I will miss him and will never forget that evening.  With all my thoughts and prayers,Betty ThissenDecember 9, 2008Dear Kathleen and Carl - I was shocked to hear of Len's passing!  I so enjoyed exchanging jokes and laughs with him as we worked finances. Words can't come close to filling the hole this has left in your heart and life, but take comfort in knowing that while he was here such a short time - he touched a lot of lives and made a difference and a better life for us.LoriDecember 8, 2008Len, you are missed and present on many minds!  May you rest in peace and in your infinite wisdom shine some light on us here as to what life is supposed to be. Miss you.  Happy Peaceful and Joyful December to you and the angels.david and Kathy keelingDecember 8, 2008Kathleen and Carl ... you have our deepest condolences.  Carl, you were Len's dad and such an important person in his life.  And, Kathleen, what a mom!  So sorry that we have been out of town during these difficult times.John and Jane CzasnowskiDecember 8, 2008We didn't have the opportunity to know Lenny as an adult but have followed his many accomplishments through Kathy and Carl. We do have memories of him as a child through our visits to Minnesota and his visits to Massachusetts.  I remember looking out the window at the White Bear Lake house and seeing his sister feeding him sand "cakes" in the sandbox, watching him with the other children on the dock by the lake finger painting with chocolate syrup, and chasing each other with the hose in our yard.  Who can forget the trip to Cape Cod -- all nine of us squeezed into a van like the clowns at the circus.  There were giggles at the sights in Provincetown and attempts to eat lobsters like the natives in Plymouth.  It is a shock that his life was taken at such an early age.  Kathy and Carl-- we wish we could be with you to help you through this time.  You are in our thoughts and prayers.Jane DelanskiDecember 7, 2008The only memories I have of Minnesota are ones with the Demers children in them.  From watermelon seed spitting contests to my first swim in the Mississippi River--all are memories I hold close to my heart.   Kathy, thank you for your gift of friendship over these past few years.  You are family no matter how "distant" and are always in my prayers. Deepest condolences...Jennifer LambDecember 5, 2008Lenny was a very special man. He had a heart as big as a mountain and a soul as deep as the seas. He had a tremendous impact on everyone who was lucky enough to know him. It saddens to know we will never hear his laughter again. My heart is with all who loved him and I send my deepest sympathy!gary goldsteinDecember 5, 2008Len, you are one of the bravest, funniest, most charismatic and truest friends anyone could be lucky enough to have. You touched our lives in a way few have ever been able to. You gave me hope and inspiration at a time i most needed it. I will miss you but you will truly be in my thoughts every day. Len you made me smile and that is how i will always remember youlove garyChristopher DeMarreDecember 4, 2008Kathleen-I wish I could be there to give you a big hug right now, just as you did for me in my time of need. You raised a wonderful man who will be missed greatly.Michelle deBritoDecember 3, 2008To Len's family, I was deeply saddened to hear of Len's passing. You are in our thoughts and prayers.   Sincerely, Michelle Mickle deBritoGina & Troy BoogrenDecember 3, 2008To all of Len's Family-May the love of friends and family carry you through your grief.  We are praying for you during this difficult time.Bev RohdaDecember 2, 2008My deepest sympathy to the Demers family.  I was shocked to learn of Lenny's death.  The memories of the time he spent in my home with Ron and the time Ron spent at your home are things that are not forgotten.  The time the boys spent together playing hockey and going to tournements will never be forgotten.  My thoughts and prayers are with you in your time of grief.Lori KmetzDecember 2, 2008Dear Len, We are to celebrate your life this morning, not that we didn't everyday!  We celebrated you with each thought of you, conversation, email or text with you or mostly when we were hugged by you!  My love, peace, and prayer's to your family and may you be an angel to guide them through this difficult time today, tomorrow, and in the years to come.  You are an immense loss my friend.  We miss YOU! You will live through all who knew you and all the lives you touched. I am a better person just in knowing you Len!  Thank you for being here the time you were! Until we meet again in the Lord's arms. Peace and of course, Tink!December 2, 2008Cathy & John MuggeeDecember 2, 2008Dear Len's family,Len was a good neighbor.  We'll miss seeing him around. Our thoughts are prayers are with you in this difficult time.Len and Pat NaltyDecember 2, 2008To the Demers family, We are deeply saddened by "Lennys" death. Oh, the good memories we have of all the hockey games and the away trips too.  We will keep all of you in our prayers and ask God that he give you strength during this most difficult time.Lori KmetzDecember 2, 2008Dear Len, We are to celebrate your life this morning, not that we didn't everyday!  We celebrated you with each thought of you, conversation, email or text with you or mostly when we were hugged by you!  My love, peace, and prayer's to your family and may you be an angel to guide them through this difficult time today, tomorrow, and in the years to come.  You are an immense loss my friend.  We miss YOU! You will live through all who knew you and all the lives you touched. I am a better person just in knowing you Len!  Thank you for being here the time you were! Until we meet again in the Lord's arms. Peace and of course, Tink!Ethan EinwohnerDecember 2, 2008It is with great sadness that we learned of Len's passing. Although I only had a short relationship with Len I was immediately impressed by his financial thinking, strong grip of the world-wide financial markets and commitment to growing Mercer. It is a shame that we were not able to grow our partnership with Len. We extend our deep condolences to Anthony, Andy, the rest of the Mercer team and Len's family.  Ethan Einwohner, Portfolio Manager, Recurrent Capital Bridge FundSusan RoachDecember 2, 2008Kathy, I am so sorry to hear about your son Len.  No bond is as great as that between a parent and child.  My deepest condolences are with you and your family as you grieve.  My god bless you.Loretta LodinDecember 1, 2008My thoughts and prayers are with the Demers family at this very sad time.  I didn't know Len well but the characteristics that made Len so well-loved were very evident from the moment I met him.  May he rest in peace.Jim HockDecember 1, 2008My sincere condolences to Len's family.  I will certainly miss the meaninful conversations  I shared with Len about life and business.  I was one of the few people who was aware of Len's condition.  He never once asked for any sympathy or complained to me about the pain he was enduring.  The dignity and courage he displayed  are  attributes to be admired.  I will miss you my friend.Jim HockNicole TavernierDecember 1, 2008Deepest condolences to the Demers family. Its difficult to believe that Len is no longer with us as just a week ago we walked out of the NY office together and laughed about upcoming Thanksgiving plans. He was a good person  and boss who brought out the best in everyone.Brad BrandtDecember 1, 2008My deepest condolences to the Demers. I got to know Len working on his home and he was one of those guys that after being with him for just a few minutes it seemed like you had known him all your life. He will be greatly missed. Len,may God Bless you and watch over you always.Jon NaltyDecember 1, 2008My condolences to the Demers family. I was just informed a few minutes ago by my mother about Len's passing, and am shocked to say the least!  It's another wake up call to the fact that none of us knows the day or hour of our meeting with the Lord. Len (or Lenny as known by his early childhood friends) will be remembered for his athleticism (a  great youth hockey player), intelligence, and kindness...and will be greatly missed.  Ephesians 2:8,9Janis QuinlanDecember 1, 2008To the Demers,I was Len's swim coach at Johnson, and as recent as a week ago, I mentioned his name to someone as a person that affected my life.  As a team leader, great student, and kind and considerate person, I knew Len would make his mark in this world.  I am so sorry for your loss, and will pray for him.  God now has a gentle and sweet soul.  Bless you Lenny!!Laurie GoldsteinDecember 1, 2008Len, words are failing me now.  You were always just a phone call away, and I wonder how many times we'll go to dial that phone and then remember you're no longer there to answer it?  I hope you know how much we love you.  You and Gary shared so much.  You will be very missed.My thoughts and condolences are with your family.Love and hugs,LaurieDuane and Mary Jo ChambersDecember 1, 2008Dear Kathleen and Carl,We are so sorry to hear of your son's passing.  Please know that we are praying for God's peace, strength and comfort for you and your family at this time.Diane HankesDecember 1, 2008Kathy,You have my deepest sympathy on the death of your son.  Please know that you and your family are in my prayers.  May your good and happy memories of Len carry you through this sad time.December 1, 2008Kathy:We are so sorry not to be with you to help in any way we can. You know how much we loved and will miss Len. As you know, he was one of our favorites. Love, Tony and JeanJoseph SalinoDecember 1, 2008I only knew Len for a short amount of time, and the impression that he left upon me, was that he was a soft spoken, intelligent young man who was very sensitive and caring to those he shared his life with! My Thoughts & Prayers are with his FamilyLen will truly be missed! Cheers LenMark Johnson & familyDecember 1, 2008What a sad day, to lose such a nice man so young in life.

We have fond memories of Len playing with our son in their early years and of catching up with Len's activities and accomplishments as time passed. Our hearts go out to all of you in his family. Please know that we are holding you in our thoughts and in our hearts.Steve (Deb) BaileyDecember 1, 2008Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire family.Know that we'll forever cherish all the memorable times we shared with Len.  And, although we are saddened, that there will not be more.  We give praise to God for blessing us with the time that we did have with him.

My warmest thoughts and prayers are with your family and friends in this time of grievance!Ann WeisethNovember 30, 2008Len, you were a beautiful soul...insightful, hysterically funny, intriguing, wise and childlike all the same. Ever-evolving, and a man of the moment; we will try to even still learn from the blessings of what you were. You had a glow of a smile! We miss you already.Kathy CrifasiNovember 30, 2008As a neighbor, our family is deeply saddened  by the loss of Len.  We haven't seen him much lately, but he used to drop in for breakfast or dinner with a constant smile as my daughter remembers.   Always positive and thoughtful.  We have Len and his family in our constant thoughts and prayers.Sean LindseyNovember 30, 2008My deepest condolences are with you as you grieve. I will keep Len and his parents in my prays. I was at a loss for words that a star that shined so bright could be taken so earlyKeith & Pat LittleNovember 30, 2008Life's many struggles are finally over for our friend, neighbor and financial counselor.

Len was always someone I've looked up to and admired... he will be greatly missed.Ron IsonNovember 30, 2008Leonard was my mentor and great friend.
