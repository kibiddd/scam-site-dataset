Lyrics to Warbots
Warbots Video:
The lawyers tell me that there are no prohibitions
Against robots making life or death decisions
Mr. Johnson, the weapons inventor
From Tennessee
Sits standin' in his laboratory
Recently
(Unknown)
If anyone out there is lookin' out for me
In a tiny tea-house
At the top of the mountain
He is creating
A truly devastating
Instrument of his deep and dark will
Many prototype
About 4 feet high
With a gun for a right arm
And a Cyclopes eye
Ready aim fire
Ready aim fire
Ready aim fire
At a Pepsi can
Perfect to the basic tasks of huntin' and killin' a man
Ready aim fired
At a Pepsi can
Perfect to the basic tasks of huntin' and killin' a man
Ready aim fire
I turn to run
That's when he hit me in the head with his gun
I fell down
I got up
And I ran into a garbage bin
Then I got up
And I ran again
(Unknown)
If anyone out there is lookin' out for me
A poisonous mist
Will come pourin' out of a fountain
Bringing on a heart-attack
(Unknown)
This is evil done knowingly
This is evil done knowingly
This is evil done knowingly
