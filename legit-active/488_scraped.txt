The mine has changed owners and the new ouners are continuing the operation as before.  You will need a PayPal account to make payment with as this is the only form of payment they accept.  Bring heavy gloves, big hammers, chisels and hand pick to get the gems out of the rock.  You can get more information from Desert USA on the www but I am not allowed to put it here in a review on Trip Advisor.This is an interesting place to go and try to find some gem stones and the area is quite interesting gust to go see where some of these gems come from.Read moreWritten October 16, 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Those of my group who paid the fee were disappointed by the results.  However, there is good chalcedony and crystals on the hills below the mine.Read moreWritten November 23, 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

If so what are the contact informationRead moreWritten November 7, 2018Jayson B1The original Opal Hill Claim was taken somewhat dubiously from previous owner Nancy Hill by Christopher Rose. It is allegedly closed to the public.
This is the first time I am announcing this to the public, Nancy Hill and myself (Jayson Barniske) staked a new claim directly to the north of the original Opal Hill Claim. The new claim is known as the Mother Opal Claim. It is open to the public for a day fee of $25. For more i information contact me through email at jbarniske@yahoo
I am at the new mine pretty much every weekend and can't wait to show all where the best fire agate can be found.Read moreWritten October 3, 2019AnswerDebi ALivingston, Montanahi....we are spending a few weeks in Lake Havasu and would like to come to your mine.  Are you open and what are your costs?   We are flying in and wonder if you have equipment that might be needed to rent?  Do we need a 4 Wheel drive car?  Any questions you may answer would be great.
