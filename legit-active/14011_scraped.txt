My dad was born in Kansas City‚Äîon the Show Me side. And y'all have got one heck of a run going with Gary Pinkel.But Mizzou in the SEC‚Äîchild, please!TOP NEWSFormer Top CFB Recruits Running Out of Chances Ahead of 2025 SeasonBleacher Report1dAsante Samuel Calls Out Deion Sanders for 'Foolishness' in Video Teaching CB TechniqueBleacher Report3dDeion Sanders, Colorado File Paperwork for Joint CFB Spring Practices with SyracuseBleacher Report3dYes, it's actually going to happen. No, it's not official yet. The SEC (likely)¬†wants to keep the plan a secret¬†to¬†prevent¬†the sports traditionalists' and media from¬†shutting down the deal. But it will be on Thursday, according to Yahoo! Sports writer Graham Watson. Tell this to all your non-football friends and come Thursday, you will become a prophet.But maybe that foresight will come with some storm clouds of angst. One needs only to look at the facts for concern. While Rivals.com has currently ranked Missouri's 2012 recruiting class as¬†25th best in the nation, there is still some anxiety when it comes to the Tigers' depth.ESPN and Rivals have both not¬†considered Pinkel's commitments, which merit Mizzou as a national title contender. Just look at their evaluation¬†of the¬†caliber of players Columbia has gained since their run for it all in '07.Missouri's Final Recruiting Ranks (2008-2012)YearESPN*Rivals*2008Not ranked25th2009Not ranked40th2010Not ranked21st2011Not ranked48th201219th (so far)25th (so far)*Note: ESPN only ranked the Top 25 classes in recruiting for the 2008 recruiting class. Rivals ranks team recruiting from 1st to 50th. By either method, the Tigers' gridiron men are not considered elite when it comes to the pigskin. Perhaps that is unfair, given the troupe's 42-15 overall record since the start of '07. In August, Bleacher Report's own Amy Daughters reported in "College Football's Top 50 Head Coaches" that Gary Pinkel was the 32nd best active coach. Maybe it's unfair to consider Missouri a "mediocre" program.But then there is the football pinnacle conference, the SEC, and there are two fiercer Tigers in that West Division alone (the division that Missouri will presumably join). From 2008 to 2011, every SEC West team finished in the Top 50 nationally (only Mississippi State is below 50th right now for the 2012 class). In 2009, each of the six teams drew in Top 25 recruiting classes.¬†Most importantly,¬†SEC West teams have won three of the past four national title games. It won't be a cake walk.Taking the average of Rivals recruiting rankings since 2008, the average SEC West team would rank 19th in recruiting. Over that same span of time, Mizzou fell at 32nd. That's splendid, but not enough to keep up the flagship years Columbia natives have grown accustom to seeing.Overall, it's obvious that the SEC desires Missouri for access to the St. Louis and Kansas City television markets. But even with the approval of football's kings, Athletic Director Mike Alden needs to take a long look in the mirror before destroying the improvements recent football teams have made.Should Missouri trust their gut reaction and bolt to the best conference in football? Or should the Athletic Department humbly acknowledge that Missouri is still in the growing pains of becoming a top-notch team and pull themselves out of the hysteria? Heck, it's not the end of the world if they say no.After all, there's always the Big East.28:49 Men's Sweet 16 Predictions üîÆTOP NEWSTop Recruits Running Out of Chances ‚åõÔ∏èBleacher Report1dAsante Samuel Calls Out DeionBleacher Report3dColorado and Syracuse Request Joint Practice ü§ùBleacher Report3dPre-Sweet 16 NBA Mock Draft üîÆBleacher Report1dNew Win-Loss Projections üîÆBleacher Report1dTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢2d2025 NFL Free Agents Who Signed With the Wrong TeamBreaking down early free agency's worst movesBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dWWE Raw on Netflix Results: Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights From ScotlandBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMen's NCAA Tournament 2025: Upset Meter for Every Sweet 16 GameRating each underdog's chances of advancing to the regional finals üì≤Bleacher Report‚Ä¢1d2025 NBA Offseason Trade Board: Ranking the Top 10 Realistic TargetsBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dSweet 16 Bracket: Updated Schedule and Upset Picks for Men's NCAA TournamentTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢2d2025 NFL Free Agents Who Signed With the Wrong TeamBreaking down early free agency's worst movesBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dWWE Raw on Netflix Results: Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights From ScotlandBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMen's NCAA Tournament 2025: Upset Meter for Every Sweet 16 GameRating each underdog's chances of advancing to the regional finals üì≤Bleacher Report‚Ä¢1d2025 NBA Offseason Trade Board: Ranking the Top 10 Realistic TargetsBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dSweet 16 Bracket: Updated Schedule and Upset Picks for Men's NCAA TournamentBleacher ReportAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersSitemapCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyCookie PreferencesTerms Of UseB/R Sports on MAXB/R Creators ProgramCopyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
