“We do not know how we would have kept our affordable senior living properties safe and up-to-date had it not been for the new underwriting allowances Lument made us aware of. They moved quickly and kept everything on track, and I was highly impressed with their dedication to, respect for, and knowledge of our organization.”
ROBERT CRUTCHFIELD
President & CEO  | Christian City Retirement Homes, Inc.
“Affordable housing transactions have a lot of moving parts, and the team at Lument is the best we have run across when it comes to knowledge and creativity. We can go to them with an idea about a transaction, and they’ll come back with three or four different approaches, each of which might provide benefits we hadn’t considered.”
LEN BRANNEN
President  | Shelter Resources, Inc
“When it comes down to it, we demand the same qualities from a financial partner that we expect from our own team. That’s what Lument delivers. Quite simply, their execution is the best we have dealt with. They are knowledgeable, fast on the uptake, and responsive.”
TOM CAROLL
Managing Partner  | Watermark Partners Real Estate
“My father acquired this asset almost 30 years ago with a great group of partners who are still part of this deal today. We truly appreciate the team effort from all involved and the professionalism from Marc Suarez and his team for providing us financing for another 30 years. Our biggest asset is our tenants who have made Li’l Abner the core fabric of the Sweetwater community.”
RAUL F. RODRIGUEZ
CEO/President  | Consolidated Real Estate Investments
“With this deal and others like it, we hope to demonstrate to transitional housing owners in other cities that they can turn to Freddie Mac for financing that meets their needs.”
