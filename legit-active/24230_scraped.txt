Failed to make Minnesota roster out of training camp in September 2000 and
spent all but one game of 2000-01 season in minor leagues. Playing in that
game on Jan. 12, 2001, enabled Daigneault to tie the NHL record for having
played on the most total franchises (10 teams).Daigneault's Big Suspension: The NHL suspended
Daigneault for 10 games and fined him $1,000 during the 1996-97 season for
slashing referee Don Koharski with 5:32 remaining in Anaheim's Feb. 23,
1997, game vs. Vancouver. Daigneault received an unsportsmanlike conduct
game misconduct for the incident, prompting an automatic 10-game suspension
under NHL rules protecting league officials from any form of abuse. The NHL
announced Daigneault's suspension on Feb. 24, 1997, which was only three
days after he had been arrived in Anaheim as part of a trade with
Pittsburgh. A review of the videotape showed that Daigneault had collided
with Koharski and likely slashed him as a natural reaction -- assuming he
was a Vancouver player. The league ruled, however, that the nature of the
contact -- even if unintentional -- merited the 10-game suspension. Had the
league determined that the slash was deliberate and Daigneault had been
trying to hurt Koharski, he would have been given a 20-game suspension under
NHL rules. As a result of the suspension, Daigneault did not return to
Anaheim's lineup until the Mighty Ducks' March 21, 1998, game at Colorado.
