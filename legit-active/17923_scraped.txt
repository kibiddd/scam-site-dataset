Apartments Information
Kessler Homes Since 1936
Our legacy began in 1924, when 9 year old Paul Kessler stepped into some big shoes and began
selling newspapers on the morning and evening trains.  At 12 he drove a Model A Ford truck,
delivering groceries for The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (A&P).
At 15, he learned his trade in the construction industry, and formed his own building company six years later.
Before passing the reigns to his son, Paul Kessler built over 1,000 single family homes,
hundreds of apartments, commercial buildings, and numerous additions to Celina, St. Marys,
and Lima, Ohio.
