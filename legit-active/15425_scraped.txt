I am offering a service to provide jump clones for a set fee of 5Million iskies.This allows you to install as many jump clones as your skill allows you in eitherMinistry of Internal Order orArdishpur FamilyBoth of these are amarr corporations. To apply for this service please apply to my corporation (name is on my ticker at side of this post)Baviasi V - Moon 1 - Ministry of Internal Order Logistic Support - This is location of my HQ its only 4 jumps from Amarr. It also has a medical bay in, so apply, get accepted then install Jump Clone.Once you sent in your application please send the 5 million iskies fee to Quazal Atreides once fee received i will accept your application into the corporation you are then free for 24 hours to get as many jump clones in the above corporation as your skills allow.The only restriction I place is that you must leave the corporation before the following DownTime after your application is accepted. If your application is sent in during my sleep time i will accept it as soon after Downtime as I am in game to allow you the maximum possible time to install your clones.You can feel secure in sending your isk over, if you are unsure feel free to look at my corporation creation post which has testiment from my customers of my honesty and integrity.http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=936549&page=2#31If you require any further information please convo me in game or if im offline send a mail and will get back to you as soon as i am ingame.ThanksQuazal Atreides[/url]
