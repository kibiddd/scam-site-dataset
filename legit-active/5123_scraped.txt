Caryl Lincoln1903 - 1983
WAMPAS was a yearly event sponsored by The Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers to highlight promising young Hollywood starlets. Caryl Lincoln was a 1929 WAMPAS Baby Star. She was born November 16, 1903 in Oakland, California.
Her brief Hollywood career consisted of about three dozen films from 1927 through the mid 1930s, and her earliest appearances were at Fox and Paramount's Christie Comedies. She did silent and sound B westerns with Tom Mix, Rex Bell, Bob Steele, Bob Custer, Buzz Barton, Tim McCoy, and Tom Tyler.   And she was the pal to leading lady Cecilia Parker in the twelve chapter serial THE LOST SPECIAL (Universal, 1932).
There was an early marriage circa 1928 to George Barr Brown. He held various publicity jobs for Pathe, Warners, and in 1932, was head of publicity at Columbia Pictures. Trade publications had news of their breakup - from the August 22, 1933 Variety: "Caryl Lincoln, 1929 Wampas star, awarded a divorce from George Brown Barr [sic], former film publiciity director, in L. A. Superior court." (Note: his correct name was George Barr Brown.)
In 1936, Caryl tied the knot with Barbara Stanwyck's brother and actor, Byron Malcolm 'Bert' Stevens. From the October 21, 1936 Variety: "Caryl Lincoln, actress, to Byron Malcolm Stephens [sic] ... in Kingston, Ariz. Groom is brother of Barbara Stanwyck. Second try for bride."
After her marriage to Bert, she semi-retired from films and son Brian Stanwyck Stevens was born in 1937.  In her later years, Caryl did occasional minor roles / bit parts in some movies and television shows.
Hubby Bert was a busy guy and his Hollywood career ran from the mid 1930s - mid 1960s ... and he has about 500 movie and television appearances at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
Bert Stevens died in 1964.
Caryl Lincoln Stevens passed away February 20, 1983 at the Motion Picture and TV Hospital, Woodland Hills, California.
