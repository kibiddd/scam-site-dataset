While there is currently no marketing plan in place, Kraft should target consumers aged 25-54, use a penetration pricing strategy, offer 6 or more flavors, and prioritize trade shows and print advertising. Direct-to-store delivery would be the best distribution channel as it provides control and lowers costs compared to using intermediaries. If the coffee pods fail due to manufacturing issues, Kraft needs to recall the product, identify the causes of failure, increase testing, and invest in advertising to regain customer trust.

Scattered radiation, which is secondary radiation deflected from its original path after interacting with a patient or other objects, poses a potential hazard to healthcare professionals, patients and general public.
Protection for Healthcare Workers and General Public: Scattered radiation surveys pinpoint areas where scattered radiation levels are highest. This helps in identifying workspaces or equipment where additional shielding or protective measures may be needed.
Since prolonged exposure to scattered radiation increases the risk of conditions like cancer and cataracts, surveys help to ensure that exposure stays within safe limits, adhering to regulatory standards and minimizing long-term health risks. Survey helps to protect Workers and General Public.
Radiation Survey data for safety improvements: The data collected in these surveys allows the X-ray department to make informed decisions about room layout, equipment placement, and workflow adjustments to further reduce exposure.
Surveys help identify where lead aprons, thyroid shields, and lead glasses are most effective, and when extra protective barriers or shields might be necessary for staff safety.
Radiation Survey for image quality: Clear, high-contrast images are essential for accurate diagnoses. When scattered radiation is minimized, the images are of higher diagnostic quality, helping radiologists detect abnormalities and make precise evaluations.
