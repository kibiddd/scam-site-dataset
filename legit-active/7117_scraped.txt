inclement weather policy
As we move deeper into winter, it's a good time to discuss St. Andrew's Inclement Weather Policy. The church staff generally follows the lead of the Iowa City Community School District in terms of snow- and ice-related cancellations. If the schools are cancelled for anything other than below-zero wind chills, it's a good bet that the Church Office will be closed as well. If all afterschool activities remain cancelled, St. Andrew's kid-related activities are probably cancelled as well. Cancellations will be posted to the St. Andrew website and Facebook page, and a push alert will be sent through the St. Andrew App. For mid-week adult activities, please contact the leader of your group or event or St. Andrew's communication director, Jeff Charis-Carlson (319-333-0205).On Sunday mornings, decisions about whether to cancel the worship service will be made by 6 a.m. at the latest -- with a congregational email going out as well as all the other communication options listed above. All worship services will be available via livestream on St. Andrew's YouTube channel.Let us know if you have any questions about the above policy, and please stay safe as the cold winds blow. As the Psalmist says, ours is a God of Winter as well as of Summer (Psalm 74:17).
