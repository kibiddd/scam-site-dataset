Clint BlackA country music traditionalist from Texas, Clint Patrick Black was one of the first artists to kick-start the mass-market popularity of country in the '90s. Black is also one of the first artists who got equally inspired by rock-oriented pop, '60s rock & roll as well as country artists like Merle Haggard, Bob Wills, and George Jones. Black was born in Long Branch, New Jersey on February 4, 1962 and grew up in Katy, Texas, took a passionate interest in music at age 13 teaching himself to play the harmonica and then guitar and bass.  He dropped out of high school to play in his brother's band and played the local club circuit around Houston, Texas as he also ventured into songwriting. Black gained popularity as an American neo traditional country music singer, songwriter, producer and occasional actor.Black and Hayden Nicholas began playing and writing songs together, soon signing with Bill Ham at RCA Records. To date Black has sold several million albums worldwide. Clint's first single, A Better Man, landed him a #1 country hit, as did the next three singles off his debut album, Killin' Time; the album itself was also #1 in album sales. He swept the Country Music Association's awards in 1989, winning in six different categories. Black's second album, Put Yourself In My Shoes, did not meet with as much critical acclaim as his debut, but nonetheless included several hit singles. He began touring with Alabama and soon married actress Lisa Hartman. A royalty-lawsuit with Bill Ham was ongoing while Black recorded his third album, The Hard Way, which received mixed reviews but became as successful as the previous two. The Hard Way received positive reviews and became an immediate hit, peaking at number two on the country charts and crossing over into the pop Top Ten. The first single from the album, We Tell Ourselves, reached number one that summer. Black began a lengthy world tour in June of 1992 to support The Hard Way.His next albums were popular within the country music scene, although his neo-traditional approach to music became less popular over time. Despite being one of the most popular acts of the 1990s, he landed only on Top 5 hits in the 2000s. After parting ways with longtime record label RCA, Clint started his own record label, Equity Music Group, in late 2003. He released two mainstream records on his own label, along with a Christmas album.Alongside his musical career, Clint also tried his hand in acting. He appeared in TV shows. He also had roles in movies. Black was a contestant on Duets in 2006 along with Randy Travis, Patti Labelle, Smokey Robinson, and several others. For his contribution to the recording industry, Black has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Black and his wife, Lisa Hartman, had a daughter, Lily Pearl, and live in Nashville, Tennessee. Clint also has a daughter, Chelsea Bain, from a previous relationship. His brothers Kevin Black and Brian Black are also singers.Although it was a success, The Hard Way wasn't as popular as Black's first two records, selling no more than a million copies. Released in 1993, No Time to Kill, his fourth album, continued the stagnation in his record sales, even though its sales were more than respectable -- the album went platinum. During the fall of 1994, Black released his fifth album, One Emotion, followed a year later by the seasonal effort Looking for Christmas. Nothin' But the Taillights appeared after a two-year hiatus, and in 1999 Black celebrated a decade of recording with D'Lectrified. Several hits collections followed into the new millennium. In 2004, Black returned with Spend My Time, his first batch of new material in over six years, closely followed by Drinkin' Songs & Other Logic in 2005. He offered a shiny, marketable version of traditional country and in the process paved the way for a new generation of country artists, particularly Garth Brooks. After Brooks broke through into the pop mainstream, Black's career began to fade away, but he remained one of the most popular and acclaimed vocalists of the '90s.In 2003, he announced his staunch support of both George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. He even recorded a song in support of both the troops and the war.
