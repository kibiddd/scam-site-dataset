Monumenta and the Wyandot Nation of Kansas are thrilled to announce the selected artist collective to create the monument Trespassers Beware! Fort Conley and Wyandot Women Warriors:
Omakyehstih Collective we are gathered together
The Omakyehstih Collective presented their concept to Wyandot Nation of Kansas leaders, and members of Wyandot/Wyandotte bands. The expansive, engaging multimedia concept was approved and celebrated across community groups and project partners.
The Omakyehstih Collective is Bettizane “Bz” Smith Me(n)didehti, Justine Kanzawah Smith and Rane Wilson, representing three generations of enrolled members of the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma. Together they bring unique specializations and creative practices to telling the Conley story through a monumental public art project.
