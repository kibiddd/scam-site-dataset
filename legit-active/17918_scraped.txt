Just throwing this out there...two things I want to just kindly remind everyone of.
Please tip your door dash driver! We really appreciate it! If you don't want to tip a rude driver than don't but people like me that are a 5 star driver deserve  a tip.  Door dash pays nothing honestly so we depend on our tips to survive! And it's weird to me that people don't because that's how I was raised.  Always tip your delivery driver.
Second thing... I've had two people interested in me coming by to give an estimate. One I did and as I was done he tells me he already has someone.  Lol so wasting my time is okay apparently! And the other person told me she needed me next week and would text me every day just to keep in touch I guess? Then tells me out of no where " guess what? I found someone to clean for me!" And I just got into a car accident and just every thing was going wrong.  It just feels like so unreal all of the bad luck. My point is don't lead someone on.  I really needed the jobs and it was a slap in the face when they both said they have some one else . What was the point of telling me that?South of Six (SOS)Neighbor
