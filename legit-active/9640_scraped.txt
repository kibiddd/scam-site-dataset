“Martinique is ideally located at the beach end of Macrossan, the shopping/cafe street of Port Douglas. You are just a few minutes’ walk to the beach, and in the other direction you have your choice of restaurants, bars and shops. My room was spacious, colorful and had everything needed for cooking should you wish to. I never turned on the AC due to very pleasant cross breeze. Lovely, quiet balcony for morning coffee! The owner couldn’t be more helpful with tour arrangements — don’t do it yourself, ask Ken. I would definitely stay here again.”
“The Managers have made us very welcome. Always available to offer advice and help. The property is beautifully presented and the room was spotless. We found the location to be perfect. Relatively quiet but easy access to the centre of town.”
“ Convenient and Friendly ”
“Stayed here for six nights to celebrate my wife’s “significant” birthday. Everything was great, the location, the room & most significantly the owners who made us so welcome. Their advice on excursions & drives to go on were right on the money. We will be back to Port Douglas and will definitely stay here.”
