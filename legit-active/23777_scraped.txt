1695. Confession of Tristram Teshe.
Being examined by Mr. Wm. Berker, mayor of York, (fn. 5) by virtue of
the King's commission, on a charge of embezzling certain goods of John
Pollerde, he declares that in the 18th year of the King, when Mr. Thos.
Mayson was mayor, the said John Pollerde being informed against by a
servant, as Teshe supposes, was put to much trouble by Mr. Geo. Gaille, then
master of the King's mint at York, and Master William Holgill, general
surveyor to Thos. late Cardinal and Archbishop, to give sureties of 200l.
that he should in his own person make answer to the said lord Cardinal and
his Council before a certain day. Teshe was one of his sureties, John
Appylyard was another; but Appylyard refused to be bound unless Pollerde
obtained other sureties to save him harmless, and Teshe allowed himself to
be bound in another obligation of 60l. to Appilyerde. For his security
again, Pollerde delivered to Teshe, "a paunte and pledge" in money and
plate to the value of 86l. On the expiry of the obligations, as nothing was
laid against Pollerde, they were cancelled by Master William Holgill, and
delivered up to Teshe, who thereupon returned to Pollerde the said "paunte"
and pledge. Denies having received goods of Pollerde otherwise, or having
embezzled any. Never knew that Pollerde or his goods were attached.
Signed, "Per me Tristamum  Teshe," with a flourish between the Christian

Nic. Barbe of St. Malo's, master of a balinger called the Mychell; Hayman
Gollard, owner. This ship was taken on suspicion and robbed by these men
following. Five Scots and 9 Bretons were in her. Balingers called the Vallantyn
of Kenton, Simon Jeylles master, the Trynyte Prowys of Keynton,
Phil. Selby, Master, and one of Plymouth, Thos. Eayr master; with other
balingers of the same quarter. "We found this Byrton ship at sea laden
with wool, cloth, and salt hides, and came from Whytthorn in Scotland; and
also we found her with these English men in her; and the Burtons
(Bretons) were put in the English balingers :Richard Brysard of Paynton,
being master of the Burton ship; John Kylford of Tormound," and eight
other Englishmen named, from "Centon," Plymouth, Dawlish, &c., "being
mariners to lead the Byrton ship."
Depositions of Brian Myners, John Barbe, and Pierre Hattyva, of St. Malo's,
and of Thos. Moysor, who say the ship was laden at Bordeaux and Nantes,
sailed at St. Malo's in the middle of May, and discharged their cargo at Whytthorn.
They hailed a great ship off the Lysard, bound for Brassell. The

have wool on board.

to pray daily for me as I shall for you. I was with my said sister and yours

gladness. She was then in health of body, thank God. I intend to be with
her again this day three weeks, and so to be monthly, so long as God shall
please. I promise you, I think every day a year till the month days; "and
that day of her presence (alack for pity) is no day, ne worthy to be called an

"My lover, my sister, my earthly comfort." Mr. White, my special friend
and yours, was suddenly attacked with his disease last night, and sent for me
about midnight. I continued with him all night. His disease is very strange.
It took him in the fingers' end of his left hand in his sleep; "wherewith he
waked, and was forthwith deadly sick at the heart by the space of a quarter
of an hour, like as he should have swooned. He had it before Christmas,
and then it did hold him by the space of an hour, more grievous than
now. He cannot think what it should be, whether it be a natural (?) as a
beginning of the palsey or of the gout, or else a plague of God. Therefore
he desireth you, for the love of God, to make meekly petition to God for the
knowledge hereof." He was confessed this night, and this morning received
the sacrament. He has sent you now other 4 nobles. I pray you to
write exhorting him to joy in visitations of God. Of the 4 nobles you
sent before, I showed him that you had bestowed 20s. in charitable deeds
while I was with you, and kept but 6s. 8d. to yourself. He said he meant
you should have had it all if it had been your pleasure, and this also. I hear
you have been with Our Lady of Cortopstrete since I was with you. "I
trust ye have then heard news. If I may not now be partaker of them in
writing, I trust in God to be with you this day three weeks." If you have
any knowledge of my brother's petitions, or my lady of Sion's, or of mine, I
pray you write to me. I dined this day with Mr. Wele and his wife. "Ye
be entirely commended from them." Your sister is well. Mr. Deryng sent
special word to her to be acquainted with me, and I have written to him
this day as to my loving friend because he is yours. "Dr. Cranmer,

He must not think him ungrateful for not having written. Much

(apud nos) that you, unlike your former self, had abandoned learning for

in a way worthy of his abilities.

1702. Calais.
"A resolution and determination taken by the King's Highness and
his Council upon such requests as were made unto his Grace by the deputies,
officers, and soldiers of the town and marches of Calais."
1. Although the King, "upon a notable ground and evident matter greatly
charging the council, officers, and rulers of the said town," has by proclamation
restrained the free access of victuallers out of England to Calais,
allowing none to pass without special licence, yet, in consideration for the
inhabitants, who are not to blame, he has devised with his council how to
enlarge this restraint for the weal of the town, restricting at the same time
the liberty of the heads and rulers; viz., the proclamation is to be revoked,
but the deputy and other officers are to be bound in recognisances not to
allow victuals to be conveyed through Calais to the dominions of other
princes, beyond the value of 5s. at a time; so that if there be a superfluity
of victuals in Calais they shall be returned to England. 2. But as the
garner of the town should be always furnished with 1,000 qrs. of corn,
which, owing to the moistness of the air, cannot be kept without changing,
the deputy and five of the council may license its exportation to prevent loss
(provided not more than 200 qrs. a year be exported), they standing bound
to the King in 100l. not to abuse the liberty. 3. Merchandise of all kinds
from other countries may be freely exported, but in case of any scarcity of
victuals the deputy and council with the mayor and aldermen of the town
shall command under a penalty every inhabitant to supply himself by a
certain day with victuals sufficient for him and his household for such time
as shall be thought advisable. Also the King is content that a provision
may be had to avoid strangers out of the town, except certain necessary
persons to be appointed by the King, and none henceforth to be sworn
English before the mayor by the deputy's warrant without a patent from the
King. 4. The officers of Calais and Guisnes shall compel the inhabitants to
learn and speak English for their common speech, binding fathers and
mothers for their children, and masters for their servants, to teach the language,
and suffer them to speak no other.

1703. Calais.
Remonstrance of the council of Calais touching a book of articles sent
them by the King and his Council in answer to such requests as the council
of Calais made to the King at his last being here :
1. They thank the King for revoking the restraint of victuals made in
England, and restoring to Calais the liberty of conveying provisions thither;
but beg that the deputy and head officers here be not bound by recognizance
to prevent victual brought from England being conveyed to other countries.
This rule could only be enforced by stopping the transit of all commodities;
and if the Picards, who bring cart-loads of flesh and other victuals to market
twice a week, were not allowed to take back beer brewed in Calais, they would
cease to come. Merchants also victual their ships here. Think it should
be sufficient for the King to give plain instructions to the deputy, to be
obeyed under penalty of his displeasure. When there is more than enough
at Calais, it should be sufficient for the deputy to bind himself by promise
not to grant any licence to convey it elsewhere than to England. 2. The
wardens of the garner of Calais demur to the regulation against uttering
any of the corn of the garner into strange parts, as contrary to their
indenture. 3. The council thank the King for the article about free export of
merchandise brought from other countries. Any restraint made by the council
has always been to secure a sufficient supply to every man for his own house.
4. Think the provision for avoiding strangers very good, but difficulties may
arise from marriages between English persons and strangers, and the children
claiming to be English. 5. Approve of the article for compelling the
inhabitants to learn and speak English; but there may be difficulty in bringing
it about. Think the benefices, of which a list, hereto annexed, has been
delivered to them by the commissary, should be given to Englishmen only,
that there should be no preaching except in English, and that the schools
should be kept by them entirely.
ii. "New additions."
They recommend further :1, a reformation of the usage by which the
constable of the Rysbank and other officers, on the arrival of a merchant
ship, claim to fill their bottles or flagons, some of them of an unreasonable
size, with wine out of the cargo; 2, a restraint on the exportation of wood
from England, except to or through Calais; 3, that when free exportation
of corn is allowed from England, it shall go by or to Calais only, by which
the King will have three customs instead of one, and the decay of the town,
which the King and many of the nobles saw when they were here, will be
arrested; 4, a reformation of tolls, which discourage the resort of victuallers
to the town; 5, that currency be given to foreign silver, as there is no white
money here but groats, half groats, and pence; and the victuallers, some of
whom come five or six miles to this market, have this money taken from them
by the searchers on their return; 6, that the wages of the retinue be paid
regularly on the 6th of April and October, and after the old rate, for in this
October payment they have lost a penny in every crown; 7, that orders be
given to customers in England, in pursuance of the King's pleasure, to restore
their former liberty of conveying victuals. Signed : John BernersEdmund

1704. [The Deputy and Council Of Calais to Henry VIII.]
Have received the King's letter, dated Greenwich, 27 Dec., containing
two articles :(1) concerning the sums of money advanced by the King for
making provision against his coming; and (2) that wools, felts, and other
merchandise belonging to the Staple shall not be dispatched hence till they
know his pleasure. As to the first, there appears some difficulty how it may
be observed without detriment to them, who bound themselves to the King,
rather that provisions might be made in time, than for any reasonable cause
why they should be bound. Hope, however, that no fault will be found in
them, though it is to their pain. As to the second, have taken such orders
as will not fail to "quadre" with the King's commandment.
Reply at length to the articles mentioned in the previous paper, and to the
same effect, though using different arguments in some places. In the "new
additions" it is mentioned that last summer there were 200 or 300 sail of
Normans and Bretons at Tynemouth haven for coal. Suggest the withdrawal
of the Deputy's power to grant licence for marriages between English and
strangers.

Reasons of dissent given against the finding of a quest by Richard
Sexton, the foreman, Robt. Garnysh, and John Saxbye, who produce
evidences to show that Geo. Hasell was not born "in this town (Calais) or
in the King's dominions." Old Father Thos. Redyng says precisely, that
he was not born here. Wm. Yong was openly and shamefully disbarred by
the King, and everything whereto his hand or consent was, disallowed.
Orders were given that all books in his hand should be brought in by a
certain day, so that it lieth with my Lord (fn. 11) and the Council to punish the
detainer of this book. Sampson Norton proved that Hasell was born in
Sperleyne, in Flanders, of which his father was bailiff. This is confirmed
by the chief lord of that country, and the mayor of St. Omers. Norton
swore that it was true before the mayor, and so did the chief part of this
inquest. John Henbury deposes that Hasell, "after that he was a stranger
enoysyd by certain old widows here," promised Henbury 20l. for letters of
denization, which Dr. Knyght asserts that Henbury endeavoured to obtain.
The brygenden-maker's wife affirms that he was born at St. Omer's. John
Laurence went to Sperleque, and obtained depositions on March 3, 1531,
from Jas. Colin, Guilbert le Griet, John le Hortre, brewer, and Bertin le
Flemencque, concerning his birth. For these reasons we will not give
credence to this book, "but submit them and their works to your discretions."
His lands are forfeited in either case, since he left them to his wife, a
stranger.

"Articles made and devised on the behalf of our most dread
sovereign lord the King, touching his revenues, to be put in execution for
the profit of his most royal estate, according as it appertaineth unto the
office of his surveyors general, and by them to be certified unto his Highness."
1. What lands and other hereditaments have been purchased or otherwise
come to his Highness since the beginning of his reign.
2. What lands have been parted with by exchange or otherwise.
3. What possessions and revenues remain in the King's hands answerable
before the general surveyors.
4. In what counties the King's castles, lands, &c. are situate, and their
condition.
5. The ruin and waste of the said castles, &c., since the beginning of the
reign.
6. What money has accrued to the King by the sale of lead, timber, stone,
or other stuff.
7. The names of the honors, castles, &c., which have been surveyed by
the general surveyors, and rentals, terriers, or extents made thereof.
8. What honors, &c., have been let on lease by the surveyors, so that the
King now has only the rent, instead of both certainties and casualties as
before.
9. The yearly value of the increase of rent of such honors, &c.
10. What fines have been paid for them. In the West country the fines
and other casualties are very great, as the lands are taken for term of life.
11. What reversions have been granted, and by what authority. It is
thought that honors, manors, and lordships, let wholly with the rents and
other profits, may fall into decay, and exactions be put upon the tenants,
the farmers in such cases being commonly their own judges, and the keeping
of courts and other necessary things disused.
12. To certify the last view of forests, parks, and chaces, with the present
quantity of game, and condition of the fencing.
13. The waters belonging to the King, both common and several, and how
the fishings and sewers are maintained."Nostre Dame de Boulogne."
14. What woods and underwoods have been sold by the surveyors, besides
those sold by the justice of the forests, or the masters of the wood-sales.
15. What arrears are unpaid by receivers, bailiffs, &c.

1715. Debts To The Crown.
Memorandum to know the King's pleasure touching these debts
following :
1. "Concerning the old obligations of king Henry the VII.th's time,
whereof he ... Sir John Heron to have been cancelled, and no mention
of him in his last book ... part of them were for exercising of offices,
and other conditions, as appearance and oth[er] ... otherwise to be
discharged, and those which had any likelihood to be good were put [in suit]
by Sir Henry Wyat, and also by me, and be yet in the King's attorney's hands
in suit ... to many of them, and other insufficient, and divers of them
new boundes be p[romised] and yet the old obligations remaining, showing
in the books a visage of both debts." (Some of these be leviable.) The
countess of Salisbury, which the King commanded to respite when it was
in suit, ijmcccxx. (Good debt.) Averay Rawson, for which Sir Ant. Poyntz
was bound, 1,550l. (Young Poyntz offers 200 mks. at days, and the prior of
Kilmaynam is bound for 150l., not yet due. The rest is little worth.)
Edw. late duke of Buckingham owed great sums, for part of which other
lords and gentlemen were bound, and for part lands were recovered, whereof
part are in the King's hand, and the rest given away. (500 mks. was a
debt due to the duke of Norfolk, parcel of his marriage money, a[nd was] consigned
over to the King, and for that [my] lord of Sussex and the lord
Berners are bound; and 1,000l. was in king Henry VII.'s time, and for that
Sir Thos. Wodhouse, his chancellor, was bound; and for 1,650l. lands were
recovered.) John Keme, Geo. Medley, Ric. Reynoldes, Robt. Palmar, and
Fras. Baldewyn are somewhat behind of 5,000 mks. due 1528, and shall owe
5,000 mks. more at March 1535. (This debt was 10,000l., for 5,000l.
delivered in naughty obligations, and 5,000l. in money, and the King hath
been paid almost 10,000 mks., with respite that is given. The rest is good,
save for Kyme's part, who hath Medley's part and his own.) Sir Thos.
Brian, for money lent for marriage of his daughter, 5,000 mks. (I think
lands were recovered, and Sir Fras. Brian hath sold them.) Lord Berners,
100l. Sir Griffith Rice, 506l. 13s. 4d. (The rest Sir Piers Egecombe hath
paid.) Lord Darcy, which the King commanded to be respited when it was
in suit, 662l. 14s. 6d. (This may be put in suit again at the King's pleasure.
Sir Thos. Cornewale, by statute and other obligations, 286l. 13s. 4d. His
lands be aliable hereunto.) Lewes Harpisfelde, 7,080l. (For much of this
new obligations be taken of Champneys and other, the rest is desperate;
and of this sum much is double obligations for one debt.) The earl of
Derby, deceased, a bill of his debt is given to my lord Norwich. (Good
debt.) The old lord Dudley, 292l. 5s. 8d. (Good debt.) Barnarde Salviati,
812l. (Not totally desperate.) The French queen and the duke of
Suffolk. I made a book to Mr. Cromwell of their debt. Anthony Guydot,
1,682l. 15s. 7d. (His days are not come, and it may be made good.) Peter
Bushome, 180l. Christopher de Peirre of Nawar, 200l. (These have
nothing in England.) Peter Corse, 1,930l. 14s. 7d. (Desperate.) John
Campouche, 288l. 15s. 8d. A poor man. John Baptist Morovelli,
493l. 19s. 1d. (Little of this is good.) Philip Friscobalde, 558l. 6s. (He

Mayor and Fellowship of the Staple gave Mr. Cromwell a bill of their debt.

hope of it. I had him in the Tower.) John Baptista Saceti and William

Grymalde, 37l. 7s. 2d. (Nothing.) William late archbishop of Canterbury,
165l. (He showeth discharge for all, save 5l. A warrant must be had for
delivery of the obligations, receiving 5l.) In the cofferer's hands, delivered to
him by Brian Tuke, for a prest to remain continually in his hands for the
better payment of the King's household, 8,000l. The earl of Northumberland,

I am willing to accomplish your desires; yet, all things considered,

party and party for perambulation of limits. Specifies his reasons. Gives
an account of the commission issued for hearing the cause, to which the earl
of Oxford and young Compton were parties, and after various delays were
now to have come to a settlement. It seems to me, therefore, "very sore"
to grant a supersedeas. I do not write this from favor to any one, nor
could I be induced to do anything by which the King should be wronged.
But I write this to you both, that we may run by a just line to the King's
honor and profit. I write this, as I perceive by your letters that you suspect
me of partiality, and that the person who came to me for the supersedeas
went away disappointed. Excuses himself upon that head, and informs them
what further steps should be taken. Saturday morning, at Hoxon. Signed :

Thanks him for his comfortable words. Begs he will move the King

him, myself being indebted in his lifetime. To keep myself from prison I
was constrained to make shift with such lands as he left me in fee, of which
I made a bargain with Sir John Dudley for 2,000l., but never had from him
or his assigns more than 1,400l.; for which I am bound to pay Sir John
Dudley, every 12th May, 400l., until the 2,000l. is paid. I am also bound to
him in the forfeiture of all my lands to the sum of 6,000l., according to
certain covenants, to the undoing of me and my family. I am also bound
in certain obligations to Sir John Alen for the manors of Swynford and
Hembley. I therefore beg you to ask the King to take into his hands my
lordship of Segeley, of the yearly value of 180l., and to discharge me anent
Dudley and Alen of the 2,200l.; the King to have this lordship for 20 years
after the decease of my mother, who is 86 years old. For your pains in this
I will give you 10l. a year for life, to buy a tun or two of wine for your
household. I would have gladly come to you, but that Sir John Dudley
lays wait for me in the city of London to keep me afore the days of payment.

1728. Erasmus Forde to Mr. Stedalff.
I write to you as one of the King's Commissioners of Sewers, against
the extreme handling of divers poor men. Mr. Cromwell, one of the King's
council, came to Southwark, and brought with him the King's commission
concerning the statute of sewers, and called before him Mr. Skote, and gave
us our charge, commanding us to act indifferently, both in reference to the
King and the meanest men. We have found the King's weirs unlawful, and
common purprestures to his own stream, and we have done the same to all
others without malice. Such as we have set to examine the weirs have been
arrested, and we could scarcely bail them; and I am informed by the curate
of our church that some are sued in Westminster Hall, as the master of
St. Thomas' Spittal told him, for unlawful fishing in the Thames. Mr. Welles
of Kingston was like to be indicted at Croydon for presenting a "steyre"
that one Dean of Kingston, taker of timber and board for Hampton Court,
has made and encroached on the Thames above all others; and, to fear us, he
says we be false harlots, and will bring the King himself to see it. He came
to my house, called Norbeton Hall, "and like an Hemprour enters into my
ground, bordered about with elms, the chief pleasure of all my house,
unknowledging to his master, the surveyor of Hampton Court," and has
dug up by the roots 35 of my purest and fairest elms. I am a poor man,
"and would rather 'a geve 35 nobles, to have borrowed it of 35 men, and,
if I were rich, rather to have lost 35l." If I am to be handled in this way,
I had liever forsake the country than be thus shamed for doing the King's
work. I am sick of an ague, and not strong enough to sue to Mr. Cromwell.

With contrite heart desiring your favor. I trust to be one of the

you to spare me within Christchurch, till Saturday or Monday next at the
furthest, five or six days' meat and drink at my last cast. I cannot provide
a house to go to till that time, as yet I have not my pension. I desire you
will discharge me of the quit-rent "and the bocher," for which neither I nor
my sureties dare go into the city, or I would have visited you. I trust you
will not see me lie in prison for the debts of the house, for. if so. I must die
there. I pray I may have a discharge
and not be arrested when I have resigned; also that I may have honest
bedding, my chaplain and two servants, considering the room that I have
outwardly kept, not regarding my person and lewdness. "Your poorest bedeman,
statu pessimo, Sir Nic. Hancok."
Pardon my rude ignorance, "for my brain and wit is not stable. God,

1732. Nicholas Hancok to Cromwell.
When I left you at Westminster Bridge I desired you to discharge
me of the debts of the house, as conscience would, especially for the butcher,
the quit-rent, and Miles Cocker, carpenter. It is now grown to 11l., and
attachments are out against me for the payment. I have sold all that I have,
and do now beg and borrow. None will lend, as I have given up my room
and house, and they bade me sue to the doers thereof. The matter may be
easy, if you allow the lease made to John Jonson of the tenement now
occupied by Miles Coker. 14 or 15 have set to their hands, saying the lease
is good. As I said, if you will discharge me of the said three debts, I would
profit triple the same. You bade me put that to light, and I should profit
thereby. I have therefore sent you two obligations and one acquittance of
Milles, sanctuary man of Westminster, until I can see you, though that is
uncertain, and I dare not go abroad. If not, I must go into sanctuary,
which shall be no honor or pleasure to you. When I gave up my house, I
little thought to be thus handled.
If I had been false, the three writings might have done harm. I can say
more than all the other dissimulers, as you shall find.

1733. Nicholas Hancok to Cromwell.
I have sent you three writings concerning the business between
Christchurch and Milles, sanctuary man. I sent also four "a-late." One
was the obligation of Ric. Gray for performing the indenture of Bexley, for
which he owes 6l. 3s. 4d. for the half year's rent due Midsummer last; also
23s. 4d. due at Christmas last, as the sub-prior says. I am willing to declare
anything else you desire. I ask to be discharged of three attachments out
against me, in Essex, Midd., and London, for the 11l. decreed against me in
Chancery, as you would not allow the lease made to John Jonson, granted
under his seal to Miles the carpenter, to stand good. I am not able to pay it.
For that, and the butcher's debt, and the quit-rent, I have sold and spent all
that I have.
I am ready to resign my raiment, bedding, and chamber, or else I must
purchase sanctuary.

carpenter, and that I should have sufficient bedding and raiment. That done, I
will do that which shall be as beneficial to the house as double the debt.
Touching any sale of lease, I have made none, although words were spoken
to me to that effect. I will do nothing to your displeasure.

1735. Nicholas [Hancok], late of Christchurch, to Cromwell.
Has had more comfort from Cromwell of late than for a long time
before; yet all his friends turn from him, and make slanderous reports of
him, saying he reckoned on good profit and quietness in giving up his house.
"And as yet the contrary I find, and so shall continue," unless the King
set him clear by granting him the petitions which Sir John Allen and Mr.
Gybson, serjeant-at-arms, know of. These two have befriended him much
without promise of reward. Will fulfil whatever he promises to do. Desires
to be set on foot again, and be his own man, when he hopes to use himself to
the honor of God and comfort of his mastership. A vicarage called Lyd,
now void, is in the King's gift by the death of the bishop of Canterbury,
which, with the priory of Bylsyngton, will set him up.
P.S.If the King will grant him the priory and vicarage by patent for
life, will act so that Cromwell shall say he has deserved them. Implores
Cromwell's help now, else he is undone.

1736. Robt. Herne to Cromwell.
Complains that a quantity of salmon, herrings, fish, oil, and honey
exported from Ireland to Lichfield is neither lawfully made nor lawfully sold
for lack of a lawyer; and begs Cromwell to write to Mr. Stred and the baily
of Lichfield to suffer the writer, who is a stock-fishmonger of London, to
have the execution of the packing, sorting, and gauging the said goods.

1737. Hugh Hunteley to Sir Will. Kingston.
I delivered your letters to my lord abbot of ... "[wher]ewith
he was verie gladde." I moved him for Derest, saying that I had heard that
he should have letters sent unto him for it, and it was better for him to grant
it to you than be compelled to give it to others. He said it was little worth,
and if he were constrained to grant any of his cells, you should have the best
of them, and there was nothing he would not do to please you in, the foundation
of his house only excepted. [Date lost.]
Bristow is the best cell.

1738. John Laurence to Henry VIII.
I am in the greatest anguish of heart. Our father minister is very
unkind to me, and has put me out of office, and he boasts he will obtain your
authority to put me in prison. My offence is that I wrote to him from the
chapter, desiring him to be so faithful to you, according to the confidence you
had in him, and exhorted him to the same by mouth. He has answered,
"Wilt thou supplant me under the King's feet? I will not obey the King,
but the religion." Since then he never spake merrily to me, and intends to
complain of me to you. If so, I beg he may be examined as to the particulars,
and then his charges will be found to be without foundation. He is greatly
altered since our chapter, and is not the man you took him for. You might
think I spoke from affection if I entered into particulars. Let me be set to
answer him face to face, when I will prove what I say. I have things to
show to you, pertaining to your honor and the wealth of the realm.
Hol., p. 1. Add.
R. O.
1739. John Laurence to [Cromwell].
I hear you have conceived great displeasure against me, for which I
am right sorry. There is, however, no just cause for it. I have always been
anxious to do you service. Whatever I have done has been for the King's
honor and yours, for which I have incurred great odium. I have informed
you I could never be suffered to come to you. If it be your pleasure to
admit me to your presence, you will find me at all times pliant and obedient.
If you will be as good a master to me as you have promised in times past, I
shall be your daily orator.

1740. [Sir George Lawson] to Cromwell.
"Gentle Mr. Cromwell, where ye write to me ye would I should
remember my wife, would to God she would remember her own honesty,
and leaving walking and idleness in London, of herself specially and four
persons which she keepeth there doing nothing but attendant upon her."
Will not drudge and drivel to keep her and four persons idle, not even delving
in the garden. Means to keep himself out of debt so as to serve the King
and make his due accounts once a year. The present time is "marvellous
chargeable" to him, notwithstanding the allowance obtained from the King
by Cromwell's help; and it would be better for his wife to break up her
house, and take either one man or one maid with her, and board in some
honest house. Has written, out of regard to Cromwell, to John Raven, to
give him 5l. for her, for her charges till Michaelmas next. Hope to see him
before then, and arrange for a divorce or separation, which she has long
wished for "in our old days." Wonders she is so crying for money, when
she had so much at divers times out of his counting-house.
Desires that this letter be burnt.
Hol., pp. 2.
R. O.
1741. Sir George Lawson to Cromwell.
In answer to a letter of Cromwell's about his wife. Has always
studied that they should live together without debt, "after the compass of
that thing that God has sent me;" but she has been extravagant, and, notwithstanding
"the great lack of my former living taken from me by Sir Thomas
Clifford," she has not abated her expences. Would rather die than not
fulfil his duty to the King "as his Majesty hath called me unto, of his goodness
and not of my merit." Was nearly brought to extreme poverty last
year, which would have been imputed to himself by Cromwell and others not
knowing the truth. She keeps at London two men and two women, whose
charges he cannot sustain. Offered to pay her charges if she would break
up her household and go to board. As to faults to be found on both sides, is
willing that the truth should be tried. Has written to John Raven to give
Cromwell 40s. or 4 marks for her. On his coming will be ordered as Cromwell
and other friends think best. Begs him to read this schedule to his
wife, and burn it.
Hol., pp. 2. Begins : Master Cromwell.
R. O.
1742. Elizabeth Lady Lawson to Cromwell.
Begs that she may have the 6l. "that your servant Candisshe hath in
his hand," towards her housekeeping "against this blessed time;" or at least
5 marks of it. Is in debt for beer and other things, and knows not of
whom she should be more bold than of her husband. Begs him not to regard
her husband's message by Mr. Gorstwycke, which was a thing surmised only
to excuse himself, and deprive her of pity. Would have waited on him
herself, but is ill at ease, and ashamed lest Cromwell think her guilty in any
such causes, which she is not. Desires to know his pleasure by Peter or Williamson,
and will make her husband such account of the money at his coming
that he shall think it well bestowed.

and above to oversee the same works at"

R. O.
1744. John Lichefeld, late Canon of Christchurch, London,
to [Cromwell].
Complains that he is in the greatest distress because, when they had
thought themselves happy in the peaceful condition of their monastery and
entirely devoted to religion, their whole house was suppressed. Is very
unfortunate, as he is one of the last admitted and dedicated to God; and
now, after his religious training, is an entire outcast, and meets no respect
from men. Has visited various religious houses and congregations, begging
to be received among them, but without any success. Will be entirely lost,
except "tua gravitas" has compassion upon him.

1746. Henry Longe, Sir Anthony Hungerford, and Sir John
Brygys to Cromwell.
We beg your favor for the abbot of Malmesbury for such payments
to the King as he is behindhand for his temporalities. His predecessor left
him little ready money. During the vacancy, part of the plate and much
of the goods of the house were embezzled. It is sore decayed, and he must
maintain it, or his friends would be blamed for his promotion. Considering
these things, the subsidy and other charges, he can make no great payment
at present. Signed.

Send me word by the bearer whether you intend to come to us at

I was afraid of being suspected by our brethren of having presumed too
much, or accelerating their trouble, which they needlessly expect at your
coming. I expect you will alleviate many a heavy scruple. From Shene,

I thank you for your great kindness at our last meeting at Coventry. I
have been suing these four months for a room at Calais which the King gave
me "of a spear, the next that dies of three men, that is, the water bailly,
or Arthur Somerset, or John Prowde, and thus (this) have I gotten by the
help of Mr. Clerk of the Kitchen," who is my kinsman. I have no money
to take me to Calais. You owe me 33s. 4d. for two rings, which I beg you
will send me. If you deny the debt, lend me 40s. You are the first I have
borrowed money of for 10 years. "Written at Southwark this present day,

alderman, with many other suitors, but did not dare speak to you.
As I went into the city I was arrested as surety for Lord Edmund Howard
for 26l., of which I have paid 10l. and have five years' payment for the rest. I
am surety for more, and dare not go abroad in the city. I pledged a damask
gown and a good coat for 5l., which I shall lose if I do not pay the money
tomorrow night. If you would lend me the money, I will leave my gown
in your hands, and pay you before Lady Day next. I have a gelding, which
I will give you for your favor.

Whereas the King gave Mr. Nedam (fn. 21) the clerkship of his works, and
at the request of my friend Mr. Flower his predecessor, Nedam promised I
should have the engrossing of his books concerning the same office; trusting
to his promise, I forsook divers worshipful men's service. I now understand
that, at your request, he has given the said office to another. If you and
Nedam knew my doings you would be content that I should enjoy it, as I

The horse was stolen last February. The thief was Robt. Keyl, now
imprisoned at "Gnugat" (Newgate), who has confessed the robbery before
Alderman Alyn, and that he had sold the horse and trappings to Thos. Sacford
for 7 nobles. On which the Alderman wrote to Sacford, warning him to deliver
up the horse and trappings; and the Ambassador sent a messenger, who
spent, in the seven days he was away, about 3 nobles (et spese in circa sette
giorni che fu fora nobeli appresso tre). The Ambassador then sent Sacford
the 7 nobles, to avoid the trouble of prosecution; but he refused to return the
horse, but wrote to the Alderman, confessing, as will be seen by the copy of
his letter, that he had bought the animal for 7 nobles, and had the trappings,
but that he had sold the former for 15; which gives reason to suspect that he
is an accomplice in the thefts. The Ambassador, therefore, begs you not to
be any longer deceived, as he has shown all possible gentleness, and desires
to have his horse back again, with the trappings, which are of black velvet
and gilt.

should reside unless one of the old canons' houses were void. (6.)
They have pulled down a single canon's house since making their statute.
(7.) The canons refused to admit to residence John Holwill, clerk, for whom
caution was offered by Thos. Sowthorn; as it was contrary to their new statute.

entered residence in his chamber, and continued it in the chaunter's place,

1788. All Hallows, Lombard Street.
Petition of the parishioners of All Hallows, Lumbert Strete, London,
addressed to Cromwell as "one of the King's Council," complaining of a
bull procured from the Court of Rome in A.D. 1453, confirming a constitution
of the bishop of London for offerings upon holidays, amounting to
14d. on every noble; whereas previously the citizens paid only 12d. on every
10s. rent to the curates or parsons of their parish churches. This imposition
the inhabitants of the City paid under compulsion, but those of the suburbs
have successfully resisted it to this day. House property now fetches double
the rent it did when the bull was obtained, and there has been much more
building within the City, especially in the parish of All Hallows, Lombard
Street, "to the sum of 40l. or near thereupon," besides the increase of rents.
"Also the said parsons and curates keep none hospitality, and be not
resident;" and they put the bull in execution with great rigor, "being
therein both judges and parties." This bull was procured without licence of
the King or his progenitors, and the petitioners dare not obey it for fear of
incurring the danger of prmunire. Also the parsons of some churches in
the City, viz., St. Magnus, St. Leonard's Eastcheap, St. Benet Graschurche,
and others, have of late sued their parishioners for tithes on the strength of
the said bull, but, fearing the consequences to themselves of putting it into
execution, have ceased their suits, and agreed to receive 12d. on every 10s.
rent.

Footnotes
1.  A modern endorsement says 25 Hen. VIII.; but as Sir Thomas Audeley is mentioned
as keeper of the Great Seal and not as Lord Chancellor, it certainly cannot be later than
January 1533, whereas the 25th year of the reign began in April 1533.
2.  This name is added in another hand.
3.  These three names are added in Cromwell's hand.
4.  These names are struck out.
5.  He was mayor of York in 1532. See Drake's Eboracum, 364.
6.  Christmas Day did not fall upon a Tuesday in any year between 1526 and 1537, but
the date of this document must lie between 1531 and 1533, when Cromwell was addressed
as one of the King's council. Christmas Day was a Monday in 1531, and a Wednesday
in 1532.
7.  This letter is certainly some years earlier than 1532. Probably it is of the year 1527
or 1528. Gold was instituted to the rectory of St. Mary Aldermary on the 10th Dec. 1526.
8.  The last clause is added in a different hand, and very faint.
9.  The names of Chr. Moreys and the master mason are added by Cromwell in a faint
ink.
10.  This title is written in Cromwell's hand on the fly leaf.
11.  Either lord Berners or lord Lisle, deputy of Calais. If the document be later than
1522 it must be lord Lisle.
12.  These are marked in the margin as paid.
13.  The date of this document is uncertain. It is placed here, at the period when Cromwell
was master of the Jewel-house, and was endeavouring to introduce reforms into the
office, or at least to ascertain the number and extent of the Crown jewels, when documents
of this nature would either be prepared from earlier memoranda, or else be copied
for his use.
14.  "Nostre Dame de Boulogne."
15.  Addressed as "your good lordships."
16.  23 Hen. VIII. c. 7.
17.  Qu. Sawyer?
18.  Edward Sutton lord Dudley, who died in 1530.
19.  The real date was 5 July 24 Hen. VIII. See Grants in July, 1532, No. 16.
20.  He was the last prior of Christchurch, London, and surrendered his house to the
King in 1532.
21.  Jas. Nedeham. See Grants in April 1531, 22 Hen. VIII., No. 20.
22.  According to Dugdale, Thaxted resigned 30 Jan. 1532.
23.  Leopold, marquis of Austria, 1096-1136.
