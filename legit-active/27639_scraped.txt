Interested in realistic driving time from Montreal to Quebec city in early September and recommended route. Would like to incorporate Mont Tremblant but after looking at map it seems out of the way. Any comments will be appreciated

The fast lane is highway 20 on the south shore. You
should make it from Montreal to Quebec City in about
2 1/2 to 3 hours at a speed of 100 km/h. If you prefer a scenic route then I would suggest the 138 on the north shore but you will have to expect one more hour to make it between both cities. It could
take more time if you stop regularly along your way.
A third alternative would be highway 40 also on the north shore. 3 hours would be realistic on this one.
When you've seen highways 20 or 40 you've seen it all. Road 138 is a lot more enjoyable but it will be longer to get to your destination. It is up to you.

Hi Chairman2,
The previous poster has given you excellent advice... By Autoroute Montreal and Quebec City are about 3 Hours apart (longer if you take the Chemin du Roy - Kings Road... most scenic between Quebec City & Trois Rivieres).
To get to Mont Tremblant, take the Northshore Autoroute 40 to Autoroute 640 and then the Laurentian Autoroute 15 North... Mont Tremblant is about 122 Kms (1-1/4 Hours) North of Boisbriand (where the 640 meets the 15)... It really isn't that big of a deal (or out of the way) and the scenery driving to the Laurentians is lovely, not to mention the fact that Mont Tremblant is indeed a very special spot year-round.
If you can swing it timewise, I would say that all 3 spots will give you the maximum enjoyment of a Quebec Holiday in that all 3 are different and representative of what Quebec is all about (History - Geography - Modern Cosmopolitan City - and Amazing Countryside).
Cheers!

Hi Chairman2,
Recommend you familiarize yourself with GOOGLE MAPS it is a Traveller's best friend, and will nicely compliment the info you'll get from TripAdvisor (acts as a handy resource tool for finding things... like landmarks, calculating distances (driving & walking) and is very easy to use). I usually keep GOOGLE MAPS open in another window when I am on TA so that I can easily "see" things that are talked about on TA.
According to GOOGLE MAPS the distance from Montreal North to Mont Tremblant is 131 Kms (Under 2 Hours Drive Time). You get to Tremblant via the Laurentian Autoroute (Hwy 15).
The turnoff from Tremblant to Quebec City is Hwy 640 at Boisbriand (about 108 Kms South of Mont Tremblant... about 1-1/4 Hours Drive Time... so about 30 minutes North of Downtown Montreal). Hwy 640 is also part of the Northshore Autoroute (640 feeding into Autoroute 40 which runs Northeast up to Quebec City).
Hwy 640 will run you 32 Kms (about a 20 Minute Drive) between Autoroute 15 and Autoroute 40.
Autoroute 40 from Charlemange (where the 640 ends) to Quebec City is about 237 Kms (2-1/2 Hours Driving Time). You'll need to add another hour or more for sightseeing if you decide to do the scenic Chemin du Roy - Kings Road between Trois Rivieres and QC.
Remember Drive Times are just that time spent driving, no accounting for Breaks, Sightseeing, Traffic, Construction, or Weather Delays.
Cheers!

Last weekend we took Rt 40 to QC and had to navigate thru 2 road closings. I suggest getting a GPS as ours really saved the day negotiating the back roads getting around the blockage to the next intersection. It got so bad that we stayed on Rt 138 into the city, a very scenic route and clear of traffic.
