:: Youkoso! :: Ohno? Who?? :: Fun Facts :: Projects :: Photos :: Ohnotionary ::Ohno? Who??Name: 大野智 (Ohno Satoshi)Name meaning: guidanceBirthday: November 26, 1980Nicknames: Oh-chan, Ohno, Ridaa, Sammy, Ohji-san, Captain, Panyasan, Satoshi-kun, Umai-sonyunHeight: 166 cm (5’5”) Weight: 49 kgs (108 lbs)Birth place: Mitakashi, Tokyo, JapanBlood type: AProfession:  singer, actor, show hostStar sign: SagittariusTalent Agency: Johnny & AssociatesJ-pop group: Arashi (嵐)Favorite color: blueFavorite food: Italian foodChi-chan’s favorite Ohno line: “BEAUTIFUL~!”Idol CareerOhno Satoshi was born in Mitakashi, Tokyo. On October 16, 1994 he joined Johnny's Jimusho as a member of Johnny's Juniors. In March of 1999 he became a member of the Junior unit that specializes in dancing, Musical Academy (MA). Ohno has also been a member of the Junior units KYOTO Oharamura, TOKYO Hamamatsucho, Yaraemonzu, TOP-J, and Junichi&JJr. On September 15, 1999 he debuted with Sakurai Sho, Aiba Masaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, and Matsumoto Jun as the new group Arashi. Their CD debut was November 3rd of the same year with the single A.RA.SHI. After their debut, Arashi appeared on the program Shounentaimu and were asked to choose a leader. Ohno won a game of Jan Ken Pon (Rock Paper Scissors) and became he leader of the group. He was very hesitant at the time to take the role, as he felt Sakurai Sho would have made a better leader. He still expresses thoughts that he is not a very good leader because he has diffficulty telling people to do things such as to not be late, as he fears he might one day be late himself. Despite his hesitancy, other members often referred to him as Leader. Recently he decided that there were too many people in Johnny's also referred to as Leader, so he has convinced the other members to start calling him Captain instead. When he first joined Arashi, he was the only member no one really knew very well. The other Arashi members had worked together often as Juniors and had been in units together, but Ohno spent much of his time as a Junior working in Kyoto doing plays. Fans also did not seem to know him well. Ohno has said that during their first appearance in Hawaii all of the other members got cheers, but he was received with silence. By the time they performed their first concert however, Ohno had developed a fanbase of his own. Though Ohno has been said to be the least popular member, he is the lead vocalist of the group and is very talented in dance. He has choreographed some of his own solo routines, and for Arashi's 2006 Summer tour he choreographed some of the routines for the whole group. To this day, Ohno continues to appear in stage plays much more often than he does television dramas, usually appearing in a play once a year. Within Arashi, Ohno is closest friends with Ninomiya Kazunari. In 2002, the two first appeared in the Shin Arashi ATARASHI-ARASHI tour as the comedy duo Ohmiya SK. The unit is a combination of their two last names and first name initials. The two sing songs, many written by Ninomiya Kazunari and do comedy routines to fill in costume change times during concerts. When they first appeared they were met with unsure fan reactions, and disapproval from the Jimusho. However, they have since become quite popular, and the Jimusho has told them they have to continue performing because of how expensive their costumes were. They still appear in most Arashi concerts, but the skits have never been filmed for the DVD releases. In 2006, Ohno and Sakurai Sho became the first Arashi members to have their own solo concerts. Ohno's concert, 2006 x Otoshidama/Arashi=3104yen (the 3104 is read "Satoshi") ran from January 29, 2006 to February 26, 2006 and was not released on DVD. Personal InformationOhno attended Toukai Daigaku Fuzoku Bousei Koutou Gakkou, but dropped out mid-term. Many other idols have attended this school, including other Johnny's members Aiba Masaki, Domoto Koichi, Inohara Yoshihiko (drop out), and Machida Shingo (drop out). Ohno's family includes himself, his mother and father, and an older sister. Ohno is said to be very close to his mother, and has mentioned that she even buys his clothes for him. It was his mother who got him to audition for Johnny’s. During the auditions, he saw her outside of a window and waved to her, catching the attention of one of the people running the audition. He was asked to come towards the front and dance, and he believes this may be how he passed the audition. Ohno is also known for his artisic talent. He has shown some of his drawings on television programs, and had a special corner on the program D no Arashi! called "O no Arashi!" in which he was challenged to select two photos at random and attempt to combine them in one drawing. Ohno has also worked with clay sculpture, and recently has expressed an interest in wood carving as well as in building a house.

:: Youkoso! :: Ohno? Who?? :: Fun Facts :: Projects :: Photos :: Ohnotionary ::Fun Facts•He doesn't look it, but he is in fact the oldest member of the group.•He also has quite a talent for art, he confessed once that he was about to quit JE and pursue art, but he decided otherwise.•He claims that he can sense the paranormal....•He's known for giving the other members unusual gifts•It is rumored that he was originally supposed to be in V6...he's not that old, he's around the same age as Shibutani Subaru, Murakami Shingo, Yokoyama Yu, and Imai Tsubasa...•He has an iron stomach....there are various tv shows where he eats the weirdest foods....and he says it's good....except for the 11 year old tea..•  Ohno is the most teased member, as well as being the most talked-about member, in Arashi.•  Ohno has a very active and wandering imagination. Therefore, he seems to look shy and quiet in his TV appearances.•  Ohno's inspiration, mentor and personal manager is his Mother.•  Ohno had originally decided to quit the band right before the band's debut to pursue his passion of becoming an artist. However, he decided, at the last minute, to stay only to see if his music career would pan out.•  Ohno is far-sighted. Like Jun Matsumoto (who is near-sighted), he wears glasses only for reading, and wears contacts for public appearances.•  Also on Aiba’s program that day, someone said that in “All or Nothing” Sho’s rap for “you know what I mean” sounds like “ra-men”, Ohno said that’s exactly what he thought •  “when he walks, his eyes are closed” --Sho •  His fans are usually older, just like his mom, they always say that he’s cute •  When they were recording A.Ra.Shi, he didn’t know that was their debut song •  Their third day in Hawaii, (one week before Arashi debuted), then he realized that they’re debuting •  before Arashi was formed, all he cared about was sleep, now he is more concerned about work •  he’s actually 165cm, though it’s publicly shown as 168cm •  Domoto Tsuyoshi thinks he’s the upcoming pretty boy •  he was once voted Pretty Boy No. 1 in a magazine •  Ohno prefers acting in plays to dramas/movies. •  Acting makes him nervous, but he likes doing concerts. •  Initially, he wasn't interested in being in the entertainment industry at all, or doing dramas. But dancing kept him interested. It was the only thing he wanted to excel in. •  He watches all his concert videos. •  He thinks his voice got higher as the years went by. He feels it's strange, since people's voice tends to get lower as they get older. Now he thinks it's as high as Nino's (which, he says, is REALLY high). •  For breakfast, he always eats bread/toast. His favorite kind of bread is the twisted donut. •  He doesn't really care about clothes. Sometimes his sister and mother gives him clothes/bags even when it's not his birthday. •  Downtown asked him what he was thinking about when performing A.ra.shi for the first time on TV. Ohno replied "mu," (nothingness) •  He once woke up late for work and decided to sleep in. But later recieved a call, and attended the TV program late. •  Ohno went to a bar with Aiba and went straight home after going to the bathroom, leaving Aiba at the bar alone. Aiba paid for the drinks. •  He cooks when he's drunk. •  He works on his paintings at his friend's place. •  He belongs to a group where he works on clay figures. •  The only thing he spends money on, is materials for drawing/painting/art. •  He's not a morning person. •  He still takes the train to go to places. •  He doesn't watch much TV. •  He has relatives in Hokkaido, and met up with them after the Iza, Now concert in Hokkaido. He was excited about eating crabs.•  Chinen Yuuri, a member of Hey! Say! JUMP [also from Johnny's], looks up to him, and says that Ohno is his favorite sempai.
