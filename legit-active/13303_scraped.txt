Provinces and territories of Canada
The provinces and territories of Canada combine to make up the world's second-largest country by area. In 1867, three provinces of British North America—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)—were united to form the new nation. Since then, Canada's external borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.
The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly called the British North America Act, 1867), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the federal government. This means that while a change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment, a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the federal Parliament or government. Moreover, in modern Canadian constitutional theory, the provinces are considered to be co-sovereign divisions, and each province has its own "Crown" represented by the lieutenant governor, whereas the territories are not sovereign, but simply part of the federal realm, and have a commissioner who represents the federal government.

Canada (i/ˈkænədə/; French: [ka.na.da]) is a country in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains;  about four-fifths of the country's population of 35 million people live near the southern border. The majority of Canada has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer.
The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the Atlantic coast, with the first establishment of a region called "Canada" occurring in 1537. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada. In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the British parliament.

Ecclesiastical Province of Canada
The Ecclesiastical Province of Canada was founded in 1860 and is one of four ecclesiastical provinces in the Anglican Church of Canada. Despite its name, the province covers only the former territory of Lower Canada (i.e., southern and eastern Quebec), the Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador (Ontario was split off as a separate province in 1913). There are seven dioceses in the province:
Montreal (Quebec),
Quebec (whose borders are consistent with Lower Canada outside of Montreal),
Fredericton (New Brunswick),
Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island (Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island),
Western Newfoundland (Newfoundland and Labrador),
Central Newfoundland (Newfoundland and Labrador), and
Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador (Newfoundland and Labrador).
Provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada are headed by a Metropolitan, elected from among the province's diocesan bishops. This bishop then becomes Archbishop of his or her diocese and Metropolitan of the Province. The current Metropolitan of the Province of Canada is the Most Rev. Percy D. Coffin, Archbishop of Western Newfoundland.

Learn Canada Provinces And Capitals
There are 10 Canadian provinces, with three territories to the north. The provinces are, in alphabetical order: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.  The difference between a province and a territory has to do with its governance. Basically, the territories have delegated powers under the authority of the Parliament of Canada; they are grouped together and ruled by the federal government. The provinces, on the other hand, exercise constitutional powers in their own right. This imbalance of power is gradually being rectified, with local decision-making powers being granted to ...

Learn Canada Provinces And Capitals
There are 10 Canadian provinces, with three territories to the north. The provinces are, in alphabetical order: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.  The difference between a province and a territory has to do with its governance. Basically, the territories have delegated powers under the authority of the Parliament of Canada; they are grouped together and ruled by the federal government. The provinces, on the other hand, exercise constitutional powers in their own right. This imbalance of power is gradually being rectified, with local decision-making powers being granted to the territories.
Alberta- Alberta is one of Canada's three prairie provinces. It shares the Canadian Rocky Mountain range with its western B.C. neighbor and is therefore famous as a ski and hiking destination. Alberta is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's crude oil industry, Athabasca oil sands, and other northern resource industries.
Saskatchewan- Saskatchewan is the middle prairie province, landlocked between the other two, Alberta and Manitoba. The majority of Saskatchewan's population lives in the southern half of the province, especially in Saskatoon and Regina. The province's major industry is agriculture, followed by mining, oil, and natural gas production.
Manitoba- ©Manitoba is the most easterly prairie province and longitudinal center of Canada. Like Saskatchewan, a majority of the population lives in the southern region. Manitoba's north comprises Canadian Shield rock and arctic tundra and is largely uninhabited.
Ontario - Ontario is Canada's most populous province, by a long shot, comprising 40 percent of the country's total population. It is also home to the federal capital of Ottawa and the unofficial financial capital of Toronto.
Quebec- Quebec is the second most populous Canadian province and known primarily for its French-speaking population, culture, and heritage.
New Brunswick-  New Brunswick is one of Canada's three Maritime provinces, which form a tiny water-bound cluster on the east coast, just below Quebec and bordering the state of Maine in the U.S.
Nova Scotia- Although the second smallest province, Nova Scotia is the second-most densely populated in the country. It is one of the three Maritime provinces and part of what forms Atlantic Canada.
Prince Edward Island-  The last of the three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is actually made up of several islands (232 to be exact, including the main island), the largest having the same name.
Newfoundland and Labrador- The most easterly province in Canada, Newfoundland, and Labrador sits on the Atlantic and is made up of the island of Newfoundland and the mainland Labrador (hence the name).
Yukon- The smallest of the three territories, Yukon (also known as "the Yukon") is the most westerly territory, bordering Alaska. The capital is Whitehorse, which is in the southern part of the territory and Yukon's only city. The portion of the Arctic coast has a tundra climate.
Northwest Territories-  Northwest Territories is the most populous of the three and borders the other two territories in—as you would expect—the northwest part of the country.
Nunavut-  Nunavut is the largest and most northern territory of Canada. It is the newest territory as well, having been separated from Northwest Territories in 1999.  One of the world's most remote locations, it has the second smallest population in Canada.

🇨🇦 How much do you know about places in Canada? Did you know that Canada is divided into 13 provinces and territories? Do you know the names of Canadian provinces and territories along with their capital cities? In today’s English lesson you will learn the names of places in Canada and enjoy gaining knowledge about Canadian geography and culture.
As we travel around the map of Canada, you’ll learn the names of the Canadian provinces and territories. You will also learn how to pronounce the names of their capital cities, and other important places.

What are Canada’s Territories and the names of their capital cities?:
Yukon - Whitehorse
Northwest Territories - Yellowknife
Nunavut - Iqaluit
*Video correction:
My pronunciation of Nunavut in this video has been corrected by many and it seems it should pronounced like 'Noon - a - vut', not 'Nun - a -vut'... despite what I learned in school when it first became a territory 😅.
What are Canada’s Provinces and the names of their capital cities?:
British Columbia (BC) - Victoria
Alberta - Edmonton
Saskatchewan - Regina
Manitoba - Winnipeg
Ontario - Toronto
Quebec - Quebec City

Learn Canada Provinces And Capitals
There are 10 Canadian provinces, with three territories to the north. The provinces are, in alphabetical order: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.  The difference between a province and a territory has to do with its governance. Basically, the territories have delegated powers under the authority of the Parliament of Canada; they are grouped together and ruled by the federal government. The provinces, on the other hand, exercise constitutional powers in their own right. This imbalance of power is gradually being rectified, with local decision-making powers being granted to the territories.
Alberta- Alberta is one of Canada's three prairie provinces. It shares the Canadian Rocky Mountain range with its western B.C. neighbor and is therefore famous as a ski and hiking destination. Alberta is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's crude oil industry, Athabasca oil sands, and other northern resource industries.
Saskatchewan- Saskatchewan is the middle prairie province, landlocked between the other two, Alberta and Manitoba. The majority of Saskatchewan's population lives in the southern half of the province, especially in Saskatoon and Regina. The province's major industry is agriculture, followed by mining, oil, and natural gas production.
Manitoba- ©Manitoba is the most easterly prairie province and longitudinal center of Canada. Like Saskatchewan, a majority of the population lives in the southern region. Manitoba's north comprises Canadian Shield rock and arctic tundra and is largely uninhabited.
Ontario - Ontario is Canada's most populous province, by a long shot, comprising 40 percent of the country's total population. It is also home to the federal capital of Ottawa and the unofficial financial capital of Toronto.
Quebec- Quebec is the second most populous Canadian province and known primarily for its French-speaking population, culture, and heritage.
New Brunswick-  New Brunswick is one of Canada's three Maritime provinces, which form a tiny water-bound cluster on the east coast, just below Quebec and bordering the state of Maine in the U.S.
Nova Scotia- Although the second smallest province, Nova Scotia is the second-most densely populated in the country. It is one of the three Maritime provinces and part of what forms Atlantic Canada.
Prince Edward Island-  The last of the three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is actually made up of several islands (232 to be exact, including the main island), the largest having the same name.
Newfoundland and Labrador- The most easterly province in Canada, Newfoundland, and Labrador sits on the Atlantic and is made up of the island of Newfoundland and the mainland Labrador (hence the name).
Yukon- The smallest of the three territories, Yukon (also known as "the Yukon") is the most westerly territory, bordering Alaska. The capital is Whitehorse, which is in the southern part of the territory and Yukon's only city. The portion of the Arctic coast has a tundra climate.
Northwest Territories-  Northwest Territories is the most populous of the three and borders the other two territories in—as you would expect—the northwest part of the country.
Nunavut-  Nunavut is the largest and most northern territory of Canada. It is the newest territory as well, having been separated from Northwest Territories in 1999.  One of the world's most remote locations, it has the second smallest population in Canada.

Provinces and territories of Canada
The provinces and territories of Canada combine to make up the world's second-largest country by area. In 1867, three provinces of British North America—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)—were united to form the new nation. Since then, Canada's external borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.
The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly called the British North America Act, 1867), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the federal government. This means that while a change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment, a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the federal Parliament or government. Moreover, in modern Canadian constitutional theory, the provinces are considered to be co-sovereign divisions, and each province has its own "Crown" represented by the lieutenant governor, whereas the territories are not sovereign, but simply part of the federal realm, and have a commissioner who represents the federal government.
