Norman Lewis Ovenell, age 87, a lifetime resident and pioneer of the Skagit Valley and Concrete for the past 70 years, passed away Wednesday, February 10, 2010 at  St. Joseph Hospital in Bellingham, WA.,  after a long and courageous battle with lung, heart and kidney disease.
He was born September 20, 1922 in Burlington, Washington to James and Mary (Dannenmiller) Ovenell.  After graduating from Burlington High School, he purchased his own herd of milk cows and crop farmed on the family farm in Burlington, WA.  In the early 1940’s Norm, his cousins & Harold Pierson cleared the P & O Ranch which later became the Double O Ranch in Concrete.
He was married to Eleanor Jungbluth on June 12, 1965 at St. Catherine’s Catholic Church in Concrete.  They raised five daughters who continue his legacy.  Dad is remembered as a devoted husband and father, one in a million!
Norman, a longtime rancher, operated Double O Ranch in Concrete, raised and showed Maine-Anjou Cattle, and taught his daughters a strong work ethic & sense of family.  Along with his wife and daughters they began Ovenell’s Heritage Inn in 1997.    He was one of the first Port Commissioners for Skagit County, was actively involved with conservation practices on his ranch,  Skagit County Cattleman’s Assoc. and was involved as a 4-H leader and as a4H beef superintendant at the Skagit County Fair.  Norman was an active member of St. Catherine’s Catholic Church and was instrumental in the construction of the CCD Center in Concrete.  He played the accordion, banjo and was known for his ability to work with his hands.  Norman also owned an airplane and was known as “Stormin’ Norman” for obvious reasons!
Norman is survived by his wife of 44 years, Eleanor Ovenell of Concrete,  five daughters, Katherine  Ovenell  Roy and her husband Calvin of Emmett, ID, Kristin Ovenell Hansen and her husband Anthony of Concrete, Cynthia Ovenell Kleinhuizen and her husband Jason of Concrete, Karin Ovenell Carter and her husband Terry of Sedro-Woolley, and Helen Ovenell of Concrete.   Six grandchildren, Norman Scott Hansen, Tyler James Hansen, Zachary James Roy, Jacob Norman Roy, Serena Noel Roy, and Matthew Calvin Roy also survive him along with his brother, Lyle Ovenell of Burlington, and numerous cousins.  He was preceded in death by his parents and an infant sister.
Upon reflection on reading his father’s obituary, our family feels this describes Norm better than we can say; he evidenced his father’s characteristics perfectly:
“The passing of Norm was to him the end of much suffering, but to us who knew him well it marked the loss of one of those rare individuals who gain respect and friendship by the old-fashioned and outmoded adherence to the concept of a true gentleman. He spoke ill of no one, softly when he felt wronged. His word was better than a written contract and his first concern was one of consideration of others. When he talked, others listened because the words were plain and full of wisdom.”
A Rosary will be recited on Tuesday, February 16, 2010 at 9:30AM with a Funeral Mass to follow at 10:00AM at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in Sedro-Woolley with Father Martin Bourke as Celebrant.   Memorials are suggested to St. Catherine’s Catholic Church or Skagit County Catholic Church building funds and Aero Skagit Ambulance Service in Concrete.
Special thanks are extended to Dr. MaryAnn Hink, Dr. Kendregan, United General Hospital, St. Joseph Intensive Care unit, Skagit Valley Hospital, Option Care, Lincare and Tracy & Hope Woods.
Arrangements and Services are under the care of Lemley Chapel, Sedro-Woolley.

To the Ovenell family, our heart and prayers are with you all at this most difficult time.

I have many fond memories of Norm and the time I spent at the Ovenell Ranch… such a warm, generous family.  Norm patiently fixed my old, beater car several times (and was always successful!)  I loved taking the Fall road trip up Hwy. 20 with Norm, Eleanor and Helen… such a beautiful, memorable day.  Heaven has gained an angel – Praying for Eleanor and family during this difficult time.

Oh so many memories from years ago.  I remember Norm as a quiet man with a lot of knowledge he shared with others.  I remember the many trips to the ranch to pick out steers for shows as well as breeding stock to raise.  I always enjoyed all of you and am smiling as I sit here remembering the shows and fairs and especially the laughter.  He always seemed to enjoy all his girls.  May God be with all of you at this difficult time and may the memories provide you comfort in the days to come.
