Richard Nixon - Jack Ruby letter
Bet you didn;t know Jack Ruby (Oswald's assassin) worked for Richard Nixon in the 1950's? That's right, when Nixon was on the House Committee on Un-American Activities, it was requested that Ruby (or Rubenstein - his real name) not be called in front of the HUAC because it would blow his cover and that he was working for Nixon.
