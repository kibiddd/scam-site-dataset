Located on Highway 64 spanning the Prairie River, this National Historic Landmark was built in 1904. The bridge is 130 feet long and 54 feet wide. Each arch displays a decorative pattern of alternating, single and double ring stones with tapered keystones about 30 inches in height. It is the only remaining three-arch stone bridge in Wisconsin.
