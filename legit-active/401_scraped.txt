Breathless (The Corrs song)
"Breathless" is a song by Irish pop rock group The Corrs. It was released on 18 July 2000, as the first single taken from their third studio album In Blue (2000). "Breathless" was co-written and produced by famed music producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who produced for Shania Twain, Bryan Adams and Def Leppard, among others.
"Breathless" is a pop and pop rock song, with lyrics about seduction and how when you're falling in love, you're just enticing that person to go one step further. A music video was filmed on the Mojave Desert and was directed by Nigel Dick.
It is considered their signature hit after topping the charts around the world. The song scaled the charts all over the world, including hitting number 1 in Spain and the UK‚Äîtheir only British chart-topper to date. It also went top ten in Australia and No. 34 in the United States in March 2001, giving the Corrs their only US Top 40 hit. The single was the 33rd biggest-selling in the UK in 2000.
In 2001 the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The song was on the soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera "Uga Uga". It was also featured in the opening scene of the film The Wedding Date, starring Debra Messing; and in a Sopranos episode, named "Another Toothpick".

Trailer (promotion)
A trailer (also known as a preview or coming attraction) is an advertisement or a commercial for a feature film that will be exhibited in the future at a cinema. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening. That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the A-movie in a double feature) begins.
Movie trailers have now become popular on DVDs and Blu-rays, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video. The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.
History
The first trailer shown in a U.S. film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical The Pleasure Seekers, opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. Loew adopted the practice, which was reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska Daily Star, describing it as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew‚Äôs picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising". Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.

Trailer music
Trailer music (a subset of production music) is the background music used for film previews, which is not always from the film's soundtrack. The purpose of this music is to complement, support and integrate the sales messaging of the mini-movie that is a film trailer. Because the score for a movie is usually composed after the film is finished (which is much after trailers are released), a trailer will incorporate music from other sources. Sometimes music from other successful films or hit songs is used as a subconscious tie-in method.
The music used in the trailer may be (or may have suggestive derivatives from):
Music from the score of other movies. Many films in this century have tracked their trailers with music from other campaigns, such as Dragonheart, Gladiator, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Edward Scissorhands, Come See the Paradise (27 times), Aliens (24 times), Bram Stoker's Dracula (18 times).
Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric, or familiarity.

Trailer (album)
Trailer is a mini album by the band Ash featuring their first three singles. An expanded edition also includes 4 b-sides. The album was released in October, 1994 through Infectious Records. The band considered it a "trailer" for their future debut album proper, and named it accordingly.
"Uncle Pat" was featured in a Heineken advert, which helped to raise the profile of the band, both in Ireland and Britain.
The name refers to movie trailers, so as a visual pun, the cover of the album shows a toppled truck trailer.
The 'noise' at the end of the track "Get Out", when reversed, slowed down and the pitch altered, is a low quality demo version of the song "Intense Thing".  This track wasn't discovered until June 2006 by 2 fans experimenting around with running different effects through Ash songs.
An early rare version of this album was released with a bonus John Peel Sessions 7" with the tracks:
Silver Surfer - 2:24
Jazz '59 - 2:06
On 6 June 1995 Trailer was released in the United States.

üé§Lyrics:
[Intro]
Go on, go on
Leave me breathless
Come on...
Hey, yeah
[Verse 1]
The daylight's fading slowly
But time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I cannot lie
From you, I cannot hide
And I'm losing the will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)
[Chorus]
So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on
Yeah
[Verse 2]
And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (don't lose it)

Lyrics
Koi jo mila to mujhe
aisa lagta tha jaise
meri saari duniya main
geeton ki rut aur
rangon ki barkha hai
khushbu ki aandhi hai
bahki hui si ab
saari fizaayen hain
mahki hui si ab
saari hawaayen hain
khoyi hui si ab
saari dishaayen hain
badli hui se ab
saari adaayen hain
jaagi ummengein hain,
dhadak raha hai dil
saason main toofaan hain,
hoton pe nagme hain
aakhon main sapne hain,
sapnon main beete hue
saare vo lamhe hain
jab koi aaya tha,
nazron pe chhaya tha
dil main samaya tha,
kaise main bataun tumhe
kaise use paaya tha,
pyaare se chehre pe
bikhri jo julphen to
aisa lagta tha jaise
kohre ke peechhe ek os
main dhula hua phool khila hai
jaise badal main ik
chaand chhupa hai
aur jhaank raha hai
jaise raat ke parde main
ek savera hai roshan roshan
aakhon main sapnon ka saagar
jismain prem sitaron ki chaadar
jaise jhalak rahi hai
lahron lahron baat kare to
jaise moti barse
jaise kahin chandi ki
payal goonjey
jaise kahin sheeshe
ke jaam girey
aur chhann se tootey
jaise koi chhip ke sitaar bajaye
jaise koi chaandni raat main gaye
jaise koi hole se paas bulaye
kaisi meethi baatain thee
vo kaisi mulakaatein thee
vo jab maine jaana tha
nazron se kaise pighalte hain dil
aur aarzoo paati hai kaise manzil
aur kaise utarta hai chaand jameen par
kaise kabhi lagta hai swarg agar hai
to bas hai yahin par
usne banaya mujhe,
aur samjhaya mujhe
hum jo mile hain,
hamain aise hi milna tha
gul jo khile hain,
unhe aise hi khilna tha
janmo ke bandhan,
janmo ke rishtey hain
jab bhi hum janme to
hum yahin milte hain
kaanon main mere jaise,
shahed sa ghulne lage
khwaabon ke dar jaise
aakhon main khulne lage
khwaabon ki duniya bhi
kitni haseen aur
kaisi rangeen thee
khwaabon ki duniya
jo kahne ko thee par
kahin bhi nahi thee
khwaab jo toote mere,
aakh jo khuli meri
hosh jo aaya mujhe
maine dekha maine jaana
vo jo kabhi aaya tha,
nazron pe chhaya tha
dil main samaya tha,
ja bhi chuka hai
aur dil mera ab hai tanha tanha
na to koi armaan hai,
na koi tamanna hai
aur na koi sapna hai
ab jo mere din aur ab
jo meri ratain hain
unmain sirf aansoon hain
unmain seif dard ki
ranj ki batain hain
aur pharyaadein hain
mera ab bhi koi nahi
main hoon aur khoye
hue pyaar ki yaadein hain (3)
ab jo mere din aur
ab jo meri raatein hain
unmein sirf aasun hain
unmein sirf dard ki
ranj ki baatein
aur faryadein hain mera
ab koi nahin main hoon aur
khoye hue pyaar ki yaadein
doob gaya hai dil
gham ke andhare main
meri saari duniya hai
dard ke ghere main
mere saare geet
dhale aahon main
banke deewana ab
yahan wahan firta hoon
thokar khata hoon
un rahaon main
jahan use dekha tha
jahan use chaha tha
jahan main hasa tha
aur badmein roya tha
jahan use paya tha
pake khoya tha
jahan kabhi fulon ke
kaliyo ke saaye the
rangeen rangeen mehki
rut main har ek kadam
pe ras rachaye the
gulshan gulshan din
main ujale the
jag mag jag mag
noor tha raaton main
jhil mil jhil mil
jahan maine khabon
ki dekhi thi manjil
jahan meri kashti ne paya tha sahil
jahan maine payai palkhon ke chhav
jahan meri bahon main nikhalti
kisi ki mari mari bahein
jahan ek chehre se hatti
nahi thi meri nigahein
jahan kal narmi narmi hi thi
pyar hi payaar hi tha hathon haththe
jahan kal gaye the prem tarane
jahan kal dekhe the sapne sunahne
kisi ko sunaye the dil ke fasane
jahan kal khayi thi jeene ki
marne ki kasme todi thi
duniya ki saari rasmein
jahan kal barsa tha prit ka badal
jahan maine thama tha koi aachal
jahan pehli baar mein hua tha pagal
ab uun rahon mein koi nahi
hai ab hai woh rahe viran viran
dil bhi jaise hairan hairan
jaane kaha gaya mera sapno ka mela
aise hoi khayalo mein khoya khoya
ghum raha tha mein kabse akela
chamka sitara jaise koi gagan mein
gunji ghata mere ghar aangan mein
kisi ne pukara mujhe mud ke jo dekha
maine mil gaya khoya hua dil ka
sahara mujhe jise maine chaha tha
jise maine puja tha
lot ke aaya hai thoda sharminda
thoda ghabraya hai
zulf pareshan kapte hout
aur bheegi hui ankhen
dekh raha mujhe gum sum gum sum
uski nazar jaise puch rahi hai
itna toh bata do
kahi khafa toh nahi tum
pyaar jo dakhi phir meri nigahoon
mein agle hi pal tha woh
meri inn bahon mein
bhool gaya mera dil jaise har gham
badal gaya jaise duniya ka mausam
jhome nazare aur jhumi fizaien aur
jhome the mann aur jhumi hawaein
jaise phir gaane lagi saari dishayen
kitni hasi hai kitni suhani
hum dono ki prem kahani...

Breathless | Shankar Mahadevan [Full Version] Lyrics
Lyrics
Koi jo mila to mujhe
aisa lagta tha jaise
meri saari duniya main
geeton ki rut aur
rangon ki barkha hai
khushbu ki aandhi hai
bahki hui si ab
saari fizaayen hain
mahki hui si ab
saari hawaayen hain
khoyi hui si ab
saari dishaayen hain
badli hui se ab
saari adaayen hain
jaagi ummengein hain,
dhadak raha hai dil
saason main toofaan hain,
hoton pe nagme hain
aakhon main sapne hain,
sapnon main beete hue
saare vo lamhe hain
jab koi aaya tha,
nazron pe chhaya tha
dil main samaya tha,
kaise main bataun tumhe
kaise use paaya tha,
pyaare se chehre pe
bikhri jo julphen to
aisa lagta tha jaise
kohre ke peechhe ek os
main dhula hua phool khila hai
jaise badal main ik
chaand chhupa hai
aur jhaank raha hai
jaise raat ke parde main
ek savera hai roshan roshan
aakhon main sapnon ka saagar
jismain prem sitaron ki chaadar
jaise jhalak rahi hai
lahron lahron baat kare to
jaise moti barse
jaise kahin chandi ki

jaise kahin sheeshe
ke jaam girey
aur chhann se tootey
jaise koi chhip ke sitaar bajaye
jaise koi chaandni raat main gaye
jaise koi hole se paas bulaye
kaisi meethi baatain thee
vo kaisi mulakaatein thee
vo jab maine jaana tha

kitni haseen aur

jo kahne ko thee par
kahin bhi nahi thee
khwaab jo toote mere,
aakh jo khuli meri
hosh jo aaya mujhe
maine dekha maine jaana
vo jo kabhi aaya tha,
nazron pe chhaya tha
dil main samaya tha,
ja bhi chuka hai
aur dil mera ab hai tanha tanha
na to koi armaan hai,
na koi tamanna hai
aur na koi sapna hai
ab jo mere din aur ab
jo meri ratain hain
unmain sirf aansoon hain
unmain seif dard ki
ranj ki batain hain
aur pharyaadein hain
mera ab bhi koi nahi
main hoon aur khoye

ab jo mere din aur
ab jo meri raatein hain
unmein sirf aasun hain
unmein sirf dard ki
ranj ki baatein
aur faryadein hain mera
ab koi nahin main hoon aur
khoye hue pyaar ki yaadein
doob gaya hai dil
gham ke andhare main
meri saari duniya hai
dard ke ghere main
mere saare geet
dhale aahon main
banke deewana ab
yahan wahan firta hoon
thokar khata hoon
un rahaon main
jahan use dekha tha
jahan use chaha tha
jahan main hasa tha
aur badmein roya tha
jahan use paya tha
pake khoya tha
jahan kabhi fulon ke
kaliyo ke saaye the
rangeen rangeen mehki
rut main har ek kadam
pe ras rachaye the
gulshan gulshan din
main ujale the
jag mag jag mag
noor tha raaton main
jhil mil jhil mil
jahan maine khabon
ki dekhi thi manjil
jahan meri kashti ne paya tha sahil
jahan maine payai palkhon ke chhav

Can't hide it (can't hide it)

And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow

Although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (don't lose it)

Lyrics
Koi jo mila to mujhe
aisa lagta tha jaise
meri saari duniya main
geeton ki rut aur
rangon ki barkha hai
khushbu ki aandhi hai
bahki hui si ab
saari fizaayen hain
mahki hui si ab
saari hawaayen hain
khoyi hui si ab
saari dishaayen hain
badli hui se ab
saari adaayen hain
jaagi ummengein hain,
dhadak raha hai dil
saason main toofaan hain,
hoton pe nagme hain
aakhon main sapne hain,
sapnon main beete hue
saare vo lamhe hain
jab koi aaya tha,
nazron pe chhaya tha
dil main samaya tha,
kaise main bataun tumhe
kaise use paaya tha,
pyaare se chehre pe
bikhri jo julphen to
aisa lagta tha jaise
kohre ke peechhe ek os
main dhula hua phool khila hai
jaise badal main ik
chaand chhupa hai
aur jhaank raha hai
jaise raat ke parde main
ek savera hai roshan roshan
aakhon main sapnon ka saagar
jismain prem sitaron ki chaadar
jaise jhalak rahi hai
lahron lahron baat kare to
jaise moti barse
jaise kahin chandi ki
payal goonjey
jaise kahin sheeshe
ke jaam girey
aur chhann se tootey
jaise koi chhip ke sitaar bajaye
jaise koi chaandni raat main gaye
jaise koi hole se paas bulaye
kaisi meethi baatain thee
vo kaisi mulakaatein thee
vo jab maine jaana tha
nazron se kaise pighalte hain dil
aur aarzoo paati hai kaise manzil
aur kaise utarta hai chaand jameen par
kaise kabhi lagta hai swarg agar hai
to bas hai yahin par
usne banaya mujhe,
aur samjhaya mujhe
hum jo mile hain,
hamain aise hi milna tha
gul jo khile hain,
unhe aise hi khilna tha
janmo ke bandhan,
janmo ke rishtey hain
jab bhi hum janme to
hum yahin milte hain
kaanon main mere jaise,
shahed sa ghulne lage
khwaabon ke dar jaise
aakhon main khulne lage
khwaabon ki duniya bhi
kitni haseen aur
kaisi rangeen thee
khwaabon ki duniya
jo kahne ko thee par
kahin bhi nahi thee
khwaab jo toote mere,
aakh jo khuli meri
hosh jo aaya mujhe

banke deewana ab
yahan wahan firta hoon
thokar khata hoon
un rahaon main
jahan use dekha tha
jahan use chaha tha
jahan main hasa tha
aur badmein roya tha
jahan use paya tha
pake khoya tha
jahan kabhi fulon ke
kaliyo ke saaye the
rangeen rangeen mehki
rut main har ek kadam
pe ras rachaye the
gulshan gulshan din
main ujale the
jag mag jag mag
noor tha raaton main
jhil mil jhil mil
jahan maine khabon
ki dekhi thi manjil
jahan meri kashti ne paya tha sahil
jahan maine payai palkhon ke chhav
jahan meri bahon main nikhalti
kisi ki mari mari bahein
jahan ek chehre se hatti
nahi thi meri nigahein
jahan kal narmi narmi hi thi
pyar hi payaar hi tha hathon haththe
jahan kal gaye the prem tarane
jahan kal dekhe the sapne sunahne
kisi ko sunaye the dil ke fasane
jahan kal khayi thi jeene ki
marne ki kasme todi thi
duniya ki saari rasmein
jahan kal barsa tha prit ka badal
jahan maine thama tha koi aachal
jahan pehli baar mein hua tha pagal
ab uun rahon mein koi nahi
hai ab hai woh rahe viran viran
dil bhi jaise hairan hairan
jaane kaha gaya mera sapno ka mela
aise hoi khayalo mein khoya khoya
ghum raha tha mein kabse akela
chamka sitara jaise koi gagan mein
gunji ghata mere ghar aangan mein
kisi ne pukara mujhe mud ke jo dekha
maine mil gaya khoya hua dil ka
sahara mujhe jise maine chaha tha
jise maine puja tha
lot ke aaya hai thoda sharminda
thoda ghabraya hai
zulf pareshan kapte hout
aur bheegi hui ankhen
dekh raha mujhe gum sum gum sum
uski nazar jaise puch rahi hai
itna toh bata do
kahi khafa toh nahi tum
pyaar jo dakhi phir meri nigahoon
mein agle hi pal tha woh
meri inn bahon mein
bhool gaya mera dil jaise har gham
badal gaya jaise duniya ka mausam
jhome nazare aur jhumi fizaien aur
jhome the mann aur jhumi hawaein
jaise phir gaane lagi saari dishayen
kitni hasi hai kitni suhani
hum dono ki prem kahani...

The Corrs ‚Äì Breathless
üé§Lyrics:
[Intro]
Go on, go on
Leave me breathless
Come on...
Hey, yeah
[Verse 1]
The daylight's fading slowly
But time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I cannot lie
From you, I cannot hide
And I'm losing the will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)
[Chorus]
So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on
Yeah
[Verse 2]
And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (don't lose it)
Don't leave it (don't leave it)
[Chorus]
So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling (loving feeling)
Make me long for your kiss
Go on (go on), go on (go on)
Yeah, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
And I can't lie
From you I cannot hide
And I've lost my will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)
[Chorus]
So go on (go on), go on (go on)
Come on, leave me breathless
