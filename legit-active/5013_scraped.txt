ORLANDO, Fla., May 23, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Kansas City Power and Light (KCP&L) has selected Siemens Energy, Inc. to implement eMeter EnergyIP®, a meter data management system (MDMS) as part of its SmartGrid demonstration project funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Using proven, solution-delivery capabilities, Siemens will provide configuration, testing and integration services into KCP&L's information technology systems. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate standards-based interoperability between the MDMS and other KCP&L SmartGrid systems.

This standards-based integration will complement the other innovative Siemens' technologies already chosen by KCP&L – Smart-Substation™ and Spectrum Power™ distribution management system (DMS). Siemens was selected to partner on this project because of its standards-based implementation processes and commitment to on-time delivery. eMeter was chosen based on its product strength and proven implementations already in the market.
"We are delighted that KCP&L chose Siemens and eMeter for our best-in-class Smart Grid delivery and look forward to building a premier Smart Grid demonstration project together," said Paul Camuti, Siemens Energy, Inc., president, Smart Grid Applications. "Smart Grid data integration, done properly, is the key to successful implementation, both for the utility and the consumer."
In addition to the integration of eMeter EnergyIP, KCP&L's SmartGrid project includes Siemens' Smart-Substation controller and Spectrum Power DMS. The Smart-Substation controller provides an intelligent substation information technology platform to enable real-time substation and feeder automation, Volt/VAr control and demand management, while Spectrum Power DMS facilitates operations information management and security.
"KCP&L's SmartGrid demonstration project will serve as the foundation to plan and study the feasibility of a broader roll out of the smart grid technologies," said Mike Deggendorf, KCP&L senior vice president of Delivery. "The technology provided by Siemens and eMeter is vital to helping us reach this goal."

In fiscal 2010 (ended September 30), the Energy Sector had revenues of approximately EUR25.5 billion and received new orders totaling more than EUR30.1 billion and posted a profit of more than EUR3.6 billion.
