I wish we were closer and able to be there. At approximately 2:15pm on Tuesday, I was in the store and the Ann Murray song, "Could I have this dance for the rest of my life" came on.  I immediately envisioned Sheila and Joey dancing to that song with big smiles on their faces. When I got home and my dad gave me the news.  I think that song was a sign from them letting us know they both are at peace now.  Sheila was such a wonderful person!  I know she will live on thru all of you.  Love you all!!
