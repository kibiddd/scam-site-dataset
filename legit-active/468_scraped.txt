Lookbooks is great for making sites for the photo/video industry. They have a really powerful backend site that allows me to go in and make adjustments as much as I’d like, which is necessary for a rapidly changing portfolio. The team is also always quick to respond whenever we need tweaks made!– TheGarage.tv
Creative, Flexible, Collaborative, the team at Lookbooks is a dream to work with. From the start of the projects we have worked with them on, they have been eager to hear the challenges and offer custom solutions.– Gallery Stock
After testing several products we found that Lookbooks offered a solution that was far and away better than the others. From calendar management, job booking, creating estimates, keeping track of job wraps and final invoicing, Lookbooks has allowed us to move from using three different software programs to just one.– Streeters
