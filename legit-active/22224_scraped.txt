It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved mother Sandra Mary Stefansson (nee Currie).
Sandra was born in 1938 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island to Anna Robert Currie (nee Logie), and Clive Westaway Currie. She grew up on The Island attending Prince St School and Prince of Wales College.
She loved PEI and often spoke of her childhood friends, the winters, and helping build the family cottage.
She left The Island to attend Dalhousie in Halifax. It was in Halifax that she met Gilbert Stefansson. The two married and raised a family in Kitchener, Ontario. Surviving Sandra are her two sons Robert and Andrew. Pre-deceased was her cherished daughter Wendy.
Sandra has 4 grandchildren, Ariel, Nicholas, Kristopher, and Eric.
In Ontario, Sandra had a lengthy career as School Secretary at Pine Grove and Pioneer Park Public Schools. She was the glue that held the schools together for two generations and was “Mrs. Stefansson” to children of the children she first saw at the schools.
Sandra later returned to Prince Edward Island, lived at the cottage on the ocean that she helped build as a child, and reconnected with old friends. She enjoyed golf at Belvedere Golf Club, art at the Seniors’ College, and bridge with her bridge club.
Sandra was a strong, intelligent, kind, and giving person. She lived a full life her way to the end. She will be greatly missed.

Alberta Jean Schmitz passed away peacefully in the comfort of her family, at the Prince Edward Home, on Friday, February 21, 2025, at the age of 86 years.
Alberta (while “Bert” to some) was born on July 30, 1938, in O’Leary, the eldest and only daughter of Elizabeth (Lidstone) and Edward MacAusland, of Bloomfield, where she was raised. After being educated locally, in Summerside, at Mount Allison University and then nursing school, Alberta started her family with her first husband Henry Scales, with the family living in Freetown, Summerside, and finally, Sherwood.
In Summerside, she returned to nursing training at the Prince County Hospital graduating, in 1968, at the top of her class. Years later, Alberta graduated from the University of New Brunswick with a Bachelor of Nursing, and later taught nursing at the UNB Saint John campus.
Her decision to move to Saudi Arabia to work as a nurse manager in that country’s hospitals also led to Alberta’s second marriage, in 1986, to Jurgen Schmitz of Germany. Together, they enjoyed expat life, travelling, and renovating their home in Virginiatown, in northeastern Ontario. She returned to Prince Edward Island, settling in Stratford, after Jurgen’s death in 2006.
In the 1970s, Alberta served as the Island’s Commissioner for the Girl Guides of Canada, starting as a parent volunteer, in Summerside. She was noted for her handcrafts and being an amazing cook. Many friends and family will remember her beautifully knitted sweaters made with yarn from MacAusland's Woollen Mill, her works of needlepoint, and potent Christmas fruitcakes. She will be remembered for her laughter over many good jokes, storytelling and coffee around the kitchen table.
Alberta is survived by her children Linda Scales, Ottawa; Heather Scales, Ten Mile House; and Philip Scales, Mermaid; granddaughter, Alyssa Gonin, Toronto; and daughter-in-law Karen Scales, Stratford. She is also survived by her brothers Allan MacAusland (Erma Hardy) and Craig (Valerie) MacAusland; sister-in-law Rita MacAusland; and numerous nephews and cousins.
In addition to her parents and husband Jurgen, Alberta was predeceased her son Austin Scales and infant son Richard Henry Scales; brother Frederick (Fred) MacAusland; sister-in-law Lois Ann MacAusland; niece Marla MacAusland Zeiler; and nephew Mark MacAusland.
Alberta’s family greatly appreciates and gives thanks for the excellent nursing, care and support given to their mother at the Garden Home and the Prince Edward Home over the last number of years. She always had a smile for you all.
Resting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel, in Charlottetown. By personal request, there will be no visitation. A private family ceremony will occur at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations in Alberta’s memory may be made directly to the Heart and Stroke Foundation or the Prince Edward Island Humane Society.
