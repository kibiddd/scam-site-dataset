Like past models, the streamlined Aegir smartpen lets you digitize handwritten notes. But this model is sleeker -- about the size of a traditional ballpoint pen -- and powered by new Livescribe+ apps for mobile and desktop. There's also a Microsoft Office plug-in that lets users to print any document with the Livescribe dot pattern. Notes made with an Aegir pen will be synced to the master document when the smartpen is connected to the computer.Christine Fisher05.09.2019Moleskine planner syncs your handwritten schedule with the cloudAs helpful as online calendars can be, it's hard to give up the satisfying feel of jotting down appointments in an old-school planner. Wouldn't it be nice if you could use a pen and paper while still having all the benefits of the internet era? Moleskine sure thinks so. The company is expanding its connected writing sets with the Smart Planner, which syncs your hand-written schedule entries with Google Calendar and services that tie into it, such as Apple's iCloud and Microsoft Outlook. It combines a Neo Smartpen with sensor-laden paper to send your meetings to the appropriate sections of the calendar -- so long as you scribble the time and subject, you can check it later on your phone or PC.Jon Fingas09.05.2017The 11 best tech gifts for workaholicsWe're not saying you want to enable them (OK, maybe we are), but you definitely know someone who works too much. They chip away at their to-do lists on weekends. They are probably even going to slip away at some point during the holidays to check work email. If that's the lifestyle they've chosen, embrace it by picking gifts that can either live at their desk, or come with them while they're trying to get work done on the road. Our list includes everything from a comfy desk chair to a wireless charging desk lamp to our favorite laptop and desktop keyboard. You might not be able to persuade them to change their rigid habits, but at least you can make them more comfortable while they toil away.

Fabricated from pure copper, the ink stylus lets you transcribe your scribblings from paper over to an iOS or Android device. The idea is to marry the tactile sensation of drawing on paper with the flexibility of digital formats. The pen is nearly a work of art in itself, but it comes with a $300 price tag -- double that of rival Livescribe.Steve Dent04.23.2016 Livescribe's latest smartpen is aimed at writing buffsLivescribe had the canny idea of letting you digitize your art by drawing with ink on actual paper, and it's trying to make the drawing experience better with the Livescribe 3 Black Edition. The pen has a grippy matte black finish with a glass-reinforced black clip and a subtle change in balance that was requested by some of the company's customers. We take that to mean that artists or perhaps lovers of calligraphy wanted something more akin to a professional tool.Steve Dent01.06.2016Livescribe launches Moleskine-branded pen-and-notebook bundleLivescribe is selling a new bundle of products comprised of a Moleskine-branded Livescribe 3 smartpen and tool belt, a Moleskine notebook that works with the device, one-year subscription to Evernote Premium and Livescribe+ apps for iOS and Android. The number of times we've mentioned the Italian brand should tell you that this specifically targets its fans. After all, it costs $230: that's equivalent to the price of a Livescribe 3 pro pack, which already includes a regular writing pad, and a separate Moleskine notebook the company released last year.Mariella Moon09.15.2015Livescribe's 8GB Echo Pro smartpen connects to Mac and WindowsLivescribe has refreshed one of its older smartpens from way before it had an option that can automatically sync with iOS and Android devices. The new Echo 8GB Pro edition can save up to 800 hours of recording and connects to a Mac or a Windows computer via old-school USB connection, just like its predecessor. It doesn't differ that much from its older sibling, so it's presumably more powerful, with more advanced components. Similar to other Livescribe pens, Echo Pro digitizes what you write on the company's special dot paper and records audio, such as a professor's lecture (or incessant droning, depending on how you see it) at the same time.Mariella Moon07.29.2015Livescribe 3 smartpen now sends your notes to Android devicesMaking good on its promise back in January, the Livescribe 3 smartpen now works with Android devices. A preview version of the requisite app is now available for download, ready to equip devices running KitKat and newer versions of Google's mobile OS. In addition to the Livescribe+ Preview Edition app, you'll also need to install the Livescribe Link Preview Edition software, with the latter handling Bluetooth pairing duties so you don't have to swipe over to the setting menus every time. If you'll recall, using the high-tech pen with Livescribe's paper notebooks automatically digitizes your scribbles to the companion app on your trusty mobile device. Folks who are eager to employ the peripheral can grab the either the Livescribe 3 or Livescribe 3 Pro Edition at a $25 discount during this so-called preview period ($130 and $175, respectively). Unfortunately, you'll have to be in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand or the United Arab Emirates to take advantage, but a global launch is expected in the coming weeks. We're hoping the final software arrives then, too.Billy Steele04.28.2015 Livescribe 3 smartpen will work with Android devices this springStarting this spring, Android users lusting after the Livescribe smartpen will no longer have to envy their iPhone- and iPad-toting peers. The company has finally developed a Livescribe+ app especially for Android, which will make Livescribe 3 compatible with select devices. Yup, it unfortunately won't work with every Android phone and tablet out there, only those running KitKat or higher with support for Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals. It retains the iOS app's features, so users can transfer handwritten notes recorded by the pens as digital text to their devices and sync audio recordings with those notes. But LiveScribe Director of Product Management Greg Wong says the app "is much more than a port" of the iOS version. "We've approached every aspect of this app," he said, "from the color palette to the user interface, to optimize for the Android platform and customer expectations."Mariella Moon01.05.2015Moleskine now has Livescribe-compatible notebooksIf you've always wanted to take the plunge and get a Livescribe smartpen but shudder at the thought of giving up your beloved Moleskine notebooks, well, have we got great news for you. Yep, you guessed it: Livescribe has partnered with the iconic paper notebook maker to produce special edition Moleskine notebooks filled with the special Livescribe paper required for the smartpen to do its job. If you don't know already, Livescribe smartpens have the ability to record audio so that they're paired with simultaneously written notes. Different pen models offer different features -- the Sky WiFi pen hooks up to Evernote while the Livescribe 3 uses Bluetooth to sync those notes with a corresponding iOS app. No matter which pen you want however, all will work with the limited edition Moleskine book. It's got the look and feel of traditional Moleskine tomes, complete with elastic closure and an expandable inner pocket (which, incidentally, comes with a handy cheat sheet of smartpen controls). If you want to snag one though, you better act soon -- there's a limited supply and each book will cost you $29.95.Nicole Lee08.26.2014Send notes to OneNote with your Livescribe 3 smartpenShortly after the news that OneNote will be free starting today, Livescribe has announced a collaboration which will see its newest smartpen integrate with Microsoft's service. Using the Livescribe+ application, Livescribe 3 owners can now easily send notes, drawings and other stuff to OneNote. Better yet, once your scribbles and doodles show up in OneNote, they can also be synced across multiple devices by way of OneDrive (formerly known as SkyDrive) -- Livescribe states this is all part of its strategy to "make smartpens a ubiquitous and valuable tool." You'll need to have your pen running the latest software, version 1.1.0, for this to work -- and in case you need any assistance with that, take a look at Livescribe's help page here.Edgar Alvarez03.17.2014Livescribe 3 smartpen announced for iOS devicesLivescribe has announced its Livescribe 3 smartpen today. The latest version of the popular print-to-digital pen features an ARM9 processor and a lithium-ion battery that lasts for up to 14 hours. Using a high-speed infrared camera at the top of the pen, it captures everything you write and draw and sends that data via Bluetooth to the companion iOS app. Once recorded by the app, users can:
See your entire page of notes exactly how they were written, via Page View.
Feed view splits your notes into useful snippets that are arranged chronologically -- allowing you to work with the specific pieces of information you need.
Search your handwritten notes to easily find what you need, when you need it.
Flip any snippet to convert handwriting to text. Use the text to create Tasks and Reminders, set up Calendar events, add Contacts and more.
Sort and organize your notes by adding tags directly from paper or from Livescribe+.
Pencasts give your notes more depth by syncing recorded audio to everything you write and draw.
Add photos and text memos to your Feed to provide more context to your handwritten notes.
Send and share PDFs of your notes, memos and photos through Mail, Messages, Evernote, Dropbox and more.
The Livescribe 3 comes in two versions. For US$150, users get the pen, a starter notebook and a ballpoint ink cartridge. For $200, users get the pen, a journal with more pages, two ballpoint ink cartridges, a leather portfolio and one year of Evernote Premium. The Livescribe+ app is a free download.Michael Grothaus10.28.2013 Livescribe 3 smartpen digitizes notes straight to your iPad, starts at $150Livescribe broke new ground last year with the Sky WiFi pen that could transfer handwritten and audio notes straight to the cloud (well, to your Evernote account anyway), so that they'd be accessible anywhere there's an internet connection. Having to jump on WiFi to send and retrieve those notes didn't make it the most convenient thing when out and about however, especially if you rely on your smartphone or tablet as a daily driver.
Enter the Livescribe 3, which offers a solution to that problem. The company's latest smartpen is positioned as a companion specifically designed to work in concert with a compatible mobile device, which in this case only applies to those that run iOS. Once paired via Bluetooth LE, notes written in a Livescribe notebook will automatically appear on the accompanying Livescribe+ app. Indeed, the application and mobile device are so integral to the Livescribe 3, that unlike the Echo or the Sky, the 3 does not have a built-in microphone. Instead, it hands off the audio recording to your iPhone or iPad when you hit the record button either on the paper or the app. As before, it'll sync the results with your scribbled notes -- the app actually highlights the coinciding text as the audio playback occurs. Of course, this means that these so-called "pencasts" are simply not possible if the pen is disconnected from the device. However, notes written while not connected will still sync up later on.Nicole Lee10.28.2013Livescribe 3 smartpen appears in FCC filing, can't wait to digitize your doodlesNow that we've got those naming suits out of the way, it's time to get down to brass tacks. With "brass tacks" involving a new smartpen, in this particular instance. The Livescribe 3 has just made itself known in a public FCC filing today, showcasing a svelte writing utensil whose main purpose in life is to digitize your handwritten notes. It's equipped with Bluetooth in order to pair with your iOS device and the accompanying Livescribe+ app, and once you start doodling in your Livescribe notebook, those very scribbles will appear in the app. There's a micro-USB connector on top for recharging it, and a handy twistable handle that turns the unit on. (Oh, and if you're curious, we're told that "more supported devices" will be added soon.)
For the power users, there are Pencasts -- said to be "interactive documents containing audio that is synchronized to your handwritten notes." As is always the case with FCC reveals, pricing and availability are nowhere to be found; that said, an FCC submission generally signals that it's just about ready for store shelves in the US. We'll watch as you attempt to digitally write about the art of containing your excitement.Darren Murph09.24.2013Livescribe 'helper' adds USB Evernote sync, removes some of the pointWhat? Yes, it's almost as puzzling as it sounds, but Livescribe is demonstrating its pragmatic approach to problem solving. In our review of the WiFi Smartpen, we maligned the sometimes flakey Evernote synchronisation process. Now you can sidestep the convenient (when it worked) wireless sync, and instead plug your WiFi pen into a nearby PC, download some software, and manually upload those hard earned audio snippets and doodles. While this method scribbles out one of the more useful features of a wireless pen, it does mean you'll never lose your notes. Like the important memo about the product rebranding.James Trew02.17.2013Livescribe renames Sky smartpen after losing trademark dispute with BSkyBLivescribe v BSkyB was one of the stranger trademark battles we've seen recently, because the two companies operate in such different spheres -- one makes smartpens, the other runs TV and internet services. Nevertheless, the English High Court has now ruled in favor of BSkyB, forcing Livescribe to recall all stock bearing the offending three-letter word and to re-baptize its "Sky wifi smartpen" simply as the "wifi smartpen". Suddenly, the packaging left over from our review of the device just feels so naughty.Sharif Sakr02.15.2013 Livescribe stops selling Sky smartpen in UK after being sued by BSkyBWell, this isn't great. No sooner did we review the Livescribe Sky WiFi smartpen and then it suddenly ceases to exist -- at least in the British Isles. Livescribe has withdrawn the product from its UK store following an allegation that it is "infringing the trademark rights of British Sky Broadcasting." Other retailers have briskly followed suit, not least because they too have been threatened with legal action. It seems the risk of someone shopping for a premium TV service and then accidentally buying a cloud-connected note-taking device were just too great for the broadcaster to bear.Sharif Sakr12.17.2012Livescribe Sky WiFi Smartpen reviewMore Info      Livescribe unleashes new Echo smartpen     Livescribe outs the Sky WiFi Smartpen     Smartpen leads to airport chaos  For a relatively niche company that has only been around for five years, Livescribe has grown quickly. Its smartpens -- which cleverly digitize handwritten notes and audio -- have already attracted a million users. However, just because these customers prefer to write their notes the old-fashioned way, that doesn't mean they aren't also obsessive about technological progress. In fact, many of them have been waiting on one new feature in particular: a totally wireless workflow, which would allow them to write a note with their smartpens and then -- without any docking or syncing -- see their scribbles appear in the cloud and on their mobile devices. Well, as you've probably guessed by now, that is precisely the gap that the new Sky pen is looking to fill. The first half of its operation is identical to that of its predecessors, the Pulse and Echo: it contains a camera and microphone, which enable the capture of handwritten notes and time-linked audio files. (You can choose between 2GB, 4GB and 8GB of built-in storage.) But what happens next is totally different. You use "buttons" printed inside Livescribe's proprietary stationery, in conjunction with the pen's OLED display, to select a local WiFi network, enter the password and sync your files directly to Evernote. The popular online note-taking platform then handles everything else, automatically filing the text and audio in the cloud using a time stamp, making it available on whatever devices run Evernote's apps or web interface. What's more, it makes the note searchable through optical character recognition (OCR) of your handwriting. If there's a downside to users getting what they've been asking for, it's that they are the ones expected to pay for it. The Sky's base model matches the Echo's $170 launch price, but that older pen came with twice as much internal storage, and can also now be had at a discount. Moreover, the 4GB and 8GB Sky pens rise to $200 and $250, respectively, which means this is only likely to be sensible if you really, really dislike writing or typing on a screen. Even assuming that you're totally stuck in your pen-and-ink ways, could a $170 pen ever be worth it? Read on to find out.Sharif Sakr11.12.2012Livescribe outs Sky WiFi Smartpen for $170, lets you record written notes and audio straight to EvernoteThe Pulse pen couldn't do it. The more recent Echo couldn't manage it either. But sending notes and linked audio wirelessly is what Livescribe's latest digital pen is all about. Branded the Sky WiFi Smartpen, it works with proprietary physical notebooks to preserve your handwritten notes and linked audio files on a minimum of 2GB of onboard storage, and then it sends them directly to your Evernote account via WiFi -- from where you can access them on pretty much any PC, tablet or smartphone. If you're wondering a how the pen selects the right network and enters a password, then it's actually pretty straightforward: Livescribe's new stationery is printed with connection buttons that, in conjunction with the OLED display on the pen itself, guide you through the procedure in a few seconds. The latest notebooks also have buttons for sending your captured thoughts to Google Drive, Dropbox and Facebook, although those services won't be activated until early next year. The basic 2GB Sky pen will arrive in stores on November 1st, priced substantially higher than its predecessor, the Echo (which will be phased out at the end of next year). The new base model will cost $170, with 4GB and 8GB varieties priced at $200 and $250. Arguably, the reliance on wireless cloud storage means that the amount of onboard memory isn't so important any more, but if you do decide to opt for the most expensive model then you'll also get a year's subscription to Evernote Premium, which is worth $45. There's a short explanatory video after the break, and as you'll see from the gallery below we've already got the Sky pen in our clutches, so expect a full review in short order.%Gallery-169459%Sharif Sakr10.29.2012Livescribe axes developer program to focus on the cloudFor the past several years one of the strangest and most interesting platforms with an app store all its own was the Livescribe series of smart-pens. Now, it's just another ditch to be dug in the development graveyard. After three years it will be closing up its SDK shop on July 22nd, and no more submissions too its app market will be accepted. The store will remain open for the time being, but the company won't guarantee compatibility with future models or firmware updates. Instead it will shift focus to cloud services like Livescribe Connect. But, don't get too worried, we're sure the healthy hacker community will keep you knee deep in text adventure ports.Terrence O'Brien07.02.201112NextAboutEngadget MastheadAbout our AdsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS FeedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying GuidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment GuidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Subscribe to our two newsletters:Engadget Deals - A weekly roundup of our favorite tech dealsThe Morning After - A daily dose of the news you needPlease enter a valid email addressPlease select a newsletterSubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms and Privacy Policy.Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
