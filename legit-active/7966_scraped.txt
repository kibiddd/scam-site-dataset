(1) Authority.—
The Secretary of Defense may provide in a military banking contract that the provisions of subsections (a)(13) and (a)(14) shall not apply to costs incurred under the contract by the contractor for payment of mandated foreign national severance pay. The Secretary may include such a provision in a military banking contract only if the Secretary determines, with respect to that contract, that the contractor has taken (or has established plans to take) appropriate actions within the contractor’s control to minimize the amount and number of incidents of the payment of severance pay by the contractor to employees under the contract who are foreign nationals.
(2) Definitions.—In paragraph (1):
(A) Military banking contract.—
The term “military banking contract” means a contract between the Secretary and a financial institution under which the financial institution operates a military banking facility outside the United States for use by members of the armed forces stationed or deployed outside the United States and other authorized personnel.
(B) Mandated foreign national severance pay.—
The term “mandated foreign national severance pay” means severance pay paid by a contractor to a foreign national employee the payment of which by the contractor is required in order to comply with a law that is generally applicable to a significant number of businesses in the country in which the foreign national receiving the payment performed services under the contract.

Editorial Notes
References in Text
Section 4 of the Buy American Act (as added by section 7002(2) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988), referred to in subsec. (d)(3), was section 4 of act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, title III, as added Pub. L. 100–418, title VII, § 7002(2), Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1545. Section 4, which was classified to section 10b–1 of former Title 41, Public Contracts, was omitted from the Code in view of section 7004 of Pub. L. 100–418 which provided that the amendment by Pub. L. 100–418 which enacted section 4 ceased to be effective on Apr. 30, 1996. Section 4 was subsequently repealed by Pub. L. 111–350, § 7(b), Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3855, which Act enacted Title 41, Public Contracts.
