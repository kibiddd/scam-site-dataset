Kings Of Leon – Pony Up                                lyrics
I got a razor sharp mind
That wants to cut you down
A little place in mind
Maybe I could bed you down
Pony up we got a ways to go
Set me up my friend
I'm running low
Oh if you take my hand I'm gonna get you outta here
The crash of bottles breaking and the swinging chandelier
In a rain of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight coming and watched her go
In a rain of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midninght come and watched her go
Yeah I watched her go
I watched her
I watched her go
I watched her go
