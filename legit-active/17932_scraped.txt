Sammy McKim Born in Seattle, Washington
on December 24, 1920
Sammy McKim was a popular young Western star in the late 1930's. He grew up to be an Illustrator at the Disney Studios, and had some adult credits along the way. His four brothers and sisters, David, Lydia, Harry, and Peggy also appeared in many movies in the 30's and 40's.
There is an excellent article on the McKim Clan in the June, 2000 issue of Classic Images magazine. While this article is not yet online, you can buy a back issue from the publisher.
