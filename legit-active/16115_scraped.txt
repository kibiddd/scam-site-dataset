Member commentA member comment:I'm emailing you to tell you about my experience with AFCU. In particular, with regards to Maria. This is my second time dealing with her and she is absolutely WONDERFUL to work with! I can't tell you how great it was working with her. She was always gracious, prompt, courteous and accommodating. I couldn't ask for a better experience! Please be sure to pass along the praise to her. In a world of 'pseudo-customer service' she is someone who believes, truly, in making the client happy. That, for me, is priceless and greatly appreciated and refreshing!
