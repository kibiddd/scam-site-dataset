What to See: From the Paseo del Bosque Trail, you can view ducks geese and other wildlife enjoying the Alameda Wetland. This constructed wetland is intended to replicate the natural wetlands that historically occupied the floodplain of the Rio Grande.
At the northeast corner of the Alameda bridge, distinguished cottonwoods shade the picnic area from the New Mexico sun.
2. Paseo del Norte
Open Space Shining River Parking Area
Parking: Access to the Paseo del Bosque Trail is from Paseo to 2nd Street, turn on El Pueblo Road and then west to Rio Grande. There is a parking area at the southwest corner.

What to See: This multi-use recreational facility provides West-side access to the bosque trail-system.
You can also enjoy the wood carvings at this site. This area was severely affected by the 2003 bosque fires and Open Space turned this tragedy into a unique, informative and artistic expression for the love of the bosque. Local artist and firefighter Joseph Mark Chavez has carved representative pieces from the cottonwood tree stumps left intact. This site also includes an ADA-accessible picnic area and trail.

Walk along the two-mile loop trail which guides visitors under the cottonwood canopy to sandy point bars along the Rio Grande. To the north of the Nature Center, visitors can observe wildlife enjoying the Candelaria Farm Wetland Preserve. The Wetland is part of an ongoing effort to restore lost habitat in the Rio Grande floodplain. The Nature Center is located at the end of Candelaria Rd. west of Rio Grande Blvd.
