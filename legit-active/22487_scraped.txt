Earthenware and
ironstone manufacturer at the  Royal Staffordshire Pottery (and
formerly at the Central Pottery),
in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.
In
1881 the old Central works in Burslem passed into the hands of
Wilkinson & Hulme.
1885
- Hulme retired from the business and Arthur J. Wilkinson continued
on his own.
A.
J. Wilkinson was the brother-in-law of Arthur Shorter who was a partner
in the pottery manufacturing company Shorter
& Boulton.
In
1891 A. J. Wilkinson died in an accident and Arthur Shorter was asked
to manage the A. J. Wilkinson pottery in Burslem - although there was
no longer any association with the Wilkinson family, the name A. J.
Wilkinson was retained.
In
about 1896 the company took over the Royal Staffordshire Pottery,
Burslem and soon left the old Central works.
c.1896
the business was incorporated and marks after this date have 'LTD' in
the name.
A
few years later Shorter bought the firm and in then in 1898 Arthur's
son Colley joined him. His younger son Guy, who became manager at
Shorter's in 1900, joined his father and Colley at Wilkinson's in
1905.
The
two bothers, Colley and Guy Shorter were made directors of Wilkinsons
in 1916.
1916
- at the age of 17  Clarice Cliff (who became the famous "Bizarre Ware"
designer) started work at at Wilkinson - previously she worked for Hollinshead
& Kirkham.
1928
the hand painted Bizarre Ware was launched.
With
the outbreak of World War II in 1939, creative output of the factory
ceased, with much of the workforce being drafted into the Armed
Forces.
Clarice married Colley Shorter in 1940 when his wife died, and she moved to the Shorter family home -
Chetwynd House in Clayton.
Wartime restrictions on decorated pottery were to continue
into the 1950's and the factory was never to produce pottery in the
style or quantity of the pre-war period although the factory continued to produce pottery bearing Clarice's name until 1964.
In 1964 Colley Shorter died. Clarice Cliff-Shorter disposed of the family shares in Wilkinsons and Newport
pottery to the neighbouring
Midwinter Co. who wanted to expand production.

Clarice Cliff
Clarice Cliff was born (1899) into a
working class family in Tunstall. She showed artistic promise at school and
left at age 13 to work as an apprentice enameller at a local factory 3 years
later moving to another firm as an apprentice lithographer, at the same time
she attended evening classes at Tunstall School of Art.
In 1916 at 17 she joined A J Wilkinson's
pottery where her drawing brought her to the attention of the owner, Colley
Shorter and he allowed her to experiment on some old stock. In 1927 he
arranged for her to study sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London.
Later in 1927 she studied in Paris.
After a few months there she returned to
Stoke-on-Trent where Shorter set her up in a decorating studio. By 1929 her
designs went into full production as 'Hand Painted Bizarre by Clarice Cliff'.
By 1931 she was an Art Director of the factory
with a decorating team of around 150.
Clarice Cliff and Shorter eventually
married in 1940 after his first wife died.
Colley Shorter
died in 1964 and Clarice in 1972.
