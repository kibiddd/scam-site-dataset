Bana is playing a more handsome and dashing Henry VIII than we're used to. Portman is playing Anne Boleyn, who is not yet his wife. It is about 1530 and she has spent a couple of years winding up his sexual hunger by denying him access to the one place in England he most wants to visit. She has reeled him in like a fish, but slowly, while she maximises her power. She's a supervixen - like something out of American TV soap. Hampton Court, 90210. Anne has told the panting Henry to divorce his wife of 20 years, Catherine of Aragon; she has told him to send her own sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson), back to the Boleyn estate at Rochford, a cruel blow because Mary loves Henry and has just borne him an illegitimate heir. Anne has urged the king to break with the corruption of Rome and become head of his own church, so he can annul his own marriage. He has done most of this and still she denies him - so he takes her by force. The rape is shown as brutish and painful, with Anne's face in the foreground, crying in anguish. Here is her final lesson in real power. Feminists have long argued that rape is an act of violence, not lust, but the movie suggests he is uncontrollably horny, as well as pissed off. Given this is partly a feminist rethink of the history, that's passing curious, but there is much more in store in this overblown, overwrought and thunderous potboiler. I don't know if the rape occurs in Philippa Gregory's hit novel, but the film departs from her text in a couple of ways, so maybe not. Mind you, plenty of historians were upset about Gregory's "historical" novel when it came out in 2002. Modern historians have largely been sympathetic to Anne Boleyn, portraying her as a powerful and intelligent woman who was betrayed by Henry and his advisers, particularly Thomas Cromwell. He helped convict her and five men on what are mostly thought to be trumped-up charges of treason, adultery and incest. These were used to execute her on May 19, 1536. AdvertisementSome feminist historians are less sympathetic to Anne, and Gregory has drawn heavily on these - although not without controversy. Professor Retha Warnicke, whom Gregory cites as a source, has distanced herself from the author's interpretation of her work, for example. There have been many films about Anne Boleyn, some of which include her sister, Mary. All are speculative, because we know so little about the early lives of both women. It is certain that The Other Boleyn Girl contains facts; distinguishing them from wild suppositions and distortion is trickier, and that's problematic in a film aimed at the young. The film is directed as a pageant. It has dark lowering skies, fabulous costumes, hairy hounds sitting at the feet of scheming lords, and enormous feasts as Henry and his retinue visit the Boleyn's castle. The piles of steaming meat are meant to suggest the vulgarity of the situation. Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and his awful brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey), have invited the king to dangle a daughter in front of him. The men wish to advance the family's fortune by giving him younger daughter Anne as a mistress. She goes along but His Highness (who's not yet His Wideness) prefers Mary. Unfortunately, she is married to the lily-livered William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch). A swift buy-off and Mary is soon in the King's bed, lying back and thinking of ... well, England, I suppose. This enrages her sister, who is sent to France to cool off. The director, Justin Chadwick, has come through the ranks of British TV. He had a hit with Bleak House, but this movie is wrecked by pictorialism and directing cliches. Scenes rush by without time for characterisation; it took me 10 minutes to work out which one was Mary and which one, Anne. People don't walk through doors, they burst through in shafts of golden light, drawn from the colour palette of Hans Holbein (Henry's court painter). It's not that I don't enjoy a good romp through a painted English countryside, or a dramatic entrance in some dark castle, but that's just sizzle, not sausage. Chadwick takes an age to get the bangers frying, because he's dazzled by the toys he's been given - tint that blue, colour that red, more of this and that and don't stint on the ermine. It's comic strip history, perhaps as a result of the American money behind it (which has dictated the casting of two Americans as the sisters). The pictorialism never lets up - half the film is shot through distorting window panes, or with furniture and walls obscuring the characters (we're not seeing the whole picture, geddit?). It's just childish. The movie has a terrific story to tell, even if it's probably piffle. The lead actors give heartfelt performances, especially Portman, but we're never allowed to live inside the drama, with the intimacy it requires. It's a series of glittering tableaux, in which headstrong girls are undone by their ambitions and the evil manipulations of men. Blow the trumpets, bang the drum, lop the heads, and forget that these were real people who once lived.
