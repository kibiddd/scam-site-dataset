A History of Serving Military
For over 85 years, Pioneer provided financial products to U.S. consumers. In 1986, all efforts were shifted to focus on helping underserved military. Pioneer Military Lending (also known as Pioneer Military Loans or Pioneer Services) was the first lender exclusively serving members of the armed forces to offer a completely online application process for personal loans. The company was an early supporter of regulations to protect military members from predatory lending practices and was the first military lender to offer a 15-day guarantee, allowing borrowers to return their loan at no cost, and no questions asked.
Now, through its strategic partnership with Lead Bank, member FDIC, Pioneer Military Credit is excited to be offering access to responsible personal loans and other financial services to military families.
Pioneer has always been committed to giving back to the communities it serves. It has received numerous national and local awards for its corporate social responsibility, military community involvement, and financial education programs.
