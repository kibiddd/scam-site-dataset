With Tender Loving Care
I can't be there to hold your hand,
I can't be there to hug you,
I can't be there to dry a tear,
But there is one thing I can do.
I can sit here in my room at night
And dream of you out there,
And make a blanket just for you
With tender loving care.
When you hold this blanket in your arms
And close your eyes real tight,
You can feel the love I tucked inside
When I made this late one night.
So dry your tears and smile a smile,
You aren't alone, you see.
You have this special blanket--
You have a part of me
