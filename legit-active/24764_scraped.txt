Crucially, they tend to be lies we are only too happy to hear, a skipping record of recyclable blandishments. "I will always love you." "You're beautiful to me." And the fairy tales don't stop at words either. The edifice of pop is built upon a tissue of lies about unquenchable passion, female sexual availability, the compunction to party and the deathless splendour of prancing about in shiny clothes while holding a tune. That's why we like it.Lily Allen is a bit different. While still wedded to many of pop's most potent fibs, her brand of pop has a kind of truth in its sights. Tonight, for her official comeback gig, Allen is wearing vertiginous goth-black heels and mirrorball hotpants; her hair is an inkier-than-natural mane with a blunt, Sixties fringe. It's as though the fresh-faced frock-lover of yore has been dipped in a tar pit; she looks like a cross between a panther and a transvestite. Glamour, pop teaches, is very important.But Allen is quick to put a chink in the illusion. "I'm waiting for you photographers to go away so I can take these shoes off," she announces to the roiling snake pit of cameramen. Sure enough, after their allotted three songs are up, the snappers slope off and a visibly more relaxed Allen kicks off the heels and minces about in her stockinged feet. She's not much of a showgirl, just singing the songs and chatting in between. But what Allen lacks in stagecraft she makes up for in substance.This showcase is in honour of her new album, due out a week tomorrow, hellbent on reminding us that Allen is not just a pampered, all-drinking, all-blogging celebrity brat made good, but an actual singer whose fame is deserved. Happily, her songs still sound as though they were written under the influence of a truth serum. Like her debut Alright, Still, its successor It's Not Me, It's You serves up tuneful twentynothing veracity cooked four ways. There's confession. There's observational verité and shooting from the hip, with a side order of puff-puncturing zeal."I could say that I'll always be there for you/ But that would be a lie and quite a pointless thing to do," runs the opening to I Could Say, a deceptively sweet, electronic break-up song in which obvious melodic imperatives are twinned with clear-eyed analysis.Thanks to modern, top-notch investigative journalism, we can speculate which of Allen's conquests it may be about. Is it Ed Simons, the (much older) Chemical Brother with whom Allen conceived last year, a relationship that ended soon after her miscarriage? Is it Seb Chew, the (older) record company man she dated for two years? Personally, I'm not interested; it's just a good song about getting over a relationship and the world can't ever have enough of those.But it would be tantalising to know who's being skewered in the deranged country rush of Not Fair. Allen wriggles around the stage, playfully cooing a graphic, damning lyric about her sexual dissatisfaction. Like much of her writing, it's hardly Leonard Cohen, but it is arresting. "I'm lying in the wet patch in the middle of the bed/ I'm feeling pretty damn hard done by/ I spent ages giving head," runs the pullquote. Her former man stands accused of carnal selfishness, premature ejaculation and, worst of all, ignorance. He might have been really good to her in other ways, but he, at least, deserves to be outed.Soon after, it's Fuck You, a playground show tune about George W Bush and "anyone else who's a bit of a dick". At one point, Allen apologises to fans for dwelling so lengthily on the new songs, confiding that she finds her old stuff "a bit juvenile". But Fuck You is splendidly puerile. "Fuck you very, very much," smiles Allen, "we hate what you do/And we hate your whole crew/ So please don't stay in touch." After a camp key-change, what sounds like a choir of foul-mouthed chipmunks chips in on backing vocals. She spends the chorus with two middle fingers aloft.It all just keeps tumbling out of her, this compulsive candour. She's happy to confess she stole the tune for Who'd of Known from Take That, who were happy to let her have it. Set to an urgent, discoid canter, Back to the Start is a half-rapped apology to the elder sister Allen slighted for years. Later there's The Fear, Allen's excellent comeback single. She gleefully notes it's outselling Lady Gaga. Gaga is this year's foremost fabulist; she sells the persistent glamour-party-sex-pop lie skilfully. How amusing it would be for Gaga to be dethroned by a flippant, existentialist ditty about the vacuousness of modern female life?Best of all, though, is set-opener, Everyone's At It. Uncannily, the tune foreshadows the drama that has already surrounded it. A pounding piano and operatic "Ah's" resonate before Allen chimes in with her straight talk. About drug-taking, legal and illegal, Everyone's at it is possibly the most level-headed song about drug hypocrisy contemporary pop has to offer. Inevitably, certain sections of society have already twisted the wrong end of the stick, forcing Allen to issue a statement about her attitude to drug-taking in words of one syllable, which we can paraphrase thus: yes, drugs are bad, don't take them. The song is more sophisticated than that, though, and quite an achievement for a (formerly) gak-happy party girl who was a member of the Groucho Club at the age of 17. She's drinking tonight, after a few months off. Performing without lubricant is just too difficult, she confides.Occasionally, you do wonder whether Allen's truth is always worth hearing. Him is a song about God that should have been left behind at whichever liberal-posh sixth-form she went to. The new songs also suffer from having abandoned the west London Anglo-Caribbean vibes that made Alright, Still so easy on the ear. Producer Greg Kurstin has done a deft job of throwing Allen around genres (electronic pop, country, the klezmer madness of Never Gonna Happen) but it is at the expense of her warmth.Allen isn't a bad storyteller herself either, styled as a punkette for her recent NME feature, all arty on OMM's cover and, amusingly, coming over all Bat for Lashes in more recent shots. But that's the fame game; she needs to keep spinning the stories. We all derive great pleasure from what Fleetwood Mac identified long ago as "sweet little lies". But it's absolutely blissful occasionally to hear a pop starlet mouthing just a little truth.Explore more on these topicsLily AllenThe ObserverPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
