When All Minds Thrive: Neurodiversity in the Workplace
Thu 10 Apr 10:45 – 11:30
UTC+1
(Amsterdam time)
Spots available · Masterclass
Every brain is unique, and this is especially evident in the workplace.While one person might be overwhelmed by frequent meetings, another thrives on regular check-ins. Some flourish while working from home, while others draw energy from the buzz of the office. These differences are a tremendous strength—people who think, communicate, and process stimuli differently also bring fresh insights and solutions. A different perspective is always valuable.
However, many divergent thinkers struggle in work environments designed for the “typical” brain. Office spaces, collaboration methods, and workflows often cater to conventional ways of thinking, which can prevent unique talents from fully developing.
In this masterclass, Saskia Schepers, HR expert & author of the bestseller “When all minds thrive”, provides a new perspective as well as strategies for both employees and employers to harness the power of diverse brain types in the workplace.
This masterclass is for:
Employers and HR professionals seeking practical tools to build a more inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly workplace.
Employees who want to understand and leverage different brain types to enhance collaboration and productivity.
Can’t make it? No worries, this session is recorded and will be available in the OpenUp library after the session.

Mindfulness
Non-judging meditation
Multiple dates available                UTC+1
(Amsterdam time)
Mindfulness
Non-judging means that you become a witness to your own experience. Becoming aware of the constant stream of judging and reacting to the inner and outer experiences that you might face.
Meditation is a powerful training that has been widely backed up by science. Some of its benefits are:
Greater concentration and focus
Less distress and more resilience
More capacity to act consciously rather than react out of a habitual pattern
More compassion, acceptance, and patience, for oneself and others
Increased sense of wholeness and well-being
Our meditation group sessions are guided by professional psychologists experienced in mindfulness practice. Previous experience is not required to join.

This is part 2 of our confidence series! If you haven’t yet taken Part 1: confidence and limiting beliefs, we suggest to start there, as this session builds on what you have learned in part 1.
How exactly does self-confidence come about? Why does it sometimes falter? And what can you do to keep it up? In this group session, you’ll dive deeper into what self-confidence is and you’ll get tips and tools to grow your self-confidence.
Insecurity doesn’t happen or change overnight. Self-confidence neither. Allow yourself some time and space to tackle it. This group session with psychologists Eva Rüger & Emma White will help you get there.
