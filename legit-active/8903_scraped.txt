Got so caught up in the FAA business and Gold Cup this week I forgot to make a thread for this week's match!
Minnesota is good, but we've played them equally so far in 2 matches this year, 1-1 draws in both games.
Hopefully last week's 3 goal outburst and dramatic finish against PR has kick started the offense. Glaeser has been great in goal and the defense has looked pretty good recently.
Last game of the home stand, hopefully the boys pull off and leave the crowd thirsty for more when the team comes home at the end of the month.

Another one I'm gonna miss.  Found out last night that I've got another family commitment today.  Hopefully I'll make at least one more game this month, before Lockhart closes....

1st half results are in-and the word of the day is: PUTRID!
Thanks Glaeser, this should be 2-0 Minn. right now.
Strikers being dominated in every phase-is the midfield even out there?
Kicks (er...I mean Stars-kudos on the retros-physically the superior side and it is showing in possession and field position.  Take 0-0 and hope for some timely subs to inject some life in this snoozer.......

Damn Shriver....  1 goal was enough, and it looked good for me when Laing did his red thang......
In all seriousness, great rebound in the second half.  Completely different team in the last frame.  Now well positioned in the playoff chase, take the all-whites to Mt. Royal and get another result.

Only 2,825 announced at the game. Very disappointing. I thought after the PRI win we'd see a better crowd.
The weather leading up to the game probably did not help. Coming from Davie, there was some pretty heavy rain at around 5pm, but only a few sprinkles at the stadium.
Great post on Twitter by the Strikers - "Attendance was 2,825, but many more will claim to have been there." I liked that..... While the Strikers looked horrible in the first half, they looked great in the second. After the two 0-0 ties, it is amazing to see the turnaround. It was a second half that ALL Strikers fans should have seen.
And now a week on the road before another against PRI. Let's hope for a good result at Montreal next week, and hopefully some buzz will develop leading to a strong turnout on 6/25.

I think the thrill is gone.  Maybe I was the jinx.  I stopped attending, they started scoring.  I was real disappointed in the play I observed, even at a D-2 level.  Happy to see the team back, but I thought the lackluster performances really killed the excitement people WANTED to re-experience.
Rainout vs. Tampa really hurt them.
Now you have a lot of concern over NASL, and fears for Lockhart.  Bad press not needed when you're floundering to right your ship.  Absent a real run to the top of the table, and significant response from ownership to establishing an understandable direction forward-you are sadly on your way back to Miami FC-ville.  Robbie needs to do more than have Twitter-meets.  He needs to hit the mainstream media and publically remind the area what the end-game is.
I need to see results added in the next 2 matches to fire up a return for Tampa-and I need to witness a performance that matches expectations.....and I'm obviously not alone in that regard........

The rain probably did not help with the crowd. Especially after what happened at the Tampa game. I know us supporters were missing some of our guys because they went to Tampa for the USA Gold Cup match.
I hope the people who came out to those first four matches(a loss, two ugly draws and that dreadful rain delay/postponement) take notice of the team's improved play of late and come back out. You always have a good time and it's the cheapest ticket in town.
The game tonight was excellent, easily the best all around performance of the season. Clean sheet and a great offensive showing. We could have easily had 5 goals in that second half. The first half obviously was not as good but I felt we outplayed Minnesota(at least from my vantage point in section 115). Great result vs. a pretty good team that is ahead of us in the table. Now we sit only 3 points out of 2nd place.
Hopefully we can keep it up in Montréal next weekend. They are still struggling, and considering how well we've played in these last two matches, I think we can escape Stade Saputo with at least 1 point.

Oh and folks, you simply can't stop showing up because the play may not be up to what you're used to. This is not the old NASL team, this is not MLS. This is D2, American D2, so expectations really should not be that high. That being said it looks as if the team has found it's stride and we should be in for a nice run of positive results.
But if you truly believe in soccer in South Florida, it is your duty to attend Strikers matches whenever you can, rain or shine, good or bad. Come out to support the local team, and get your world class fix on ESPN or FSC. Then someday that world class soccer will have no choice but to come back to us.

All of this is interesting, but, couldn't anyone post that the Strikers won 3-0?

Yes they won 3-0 and have scored 6 goals in the last two games! Things are starting to gel and coach Shore seems to know his players abilities a lot better. As long as the goals keep pouring in, Glaeser will do the rest.
Go Strikers!

Seemingly so.  Hopefully they can continue this run of form when I can attend.  Some good games coming up at Lockhart that I hope to be at.  It would be great to see a win live....
And, dr's post #11 tells it like it is.  Nostalgia is great, but this is 2011 with the Strikers in a North American Div 2 league.  Support this team as best you can, as often as you can.  Do not expect the level of play you see in MLS, let alone the EPL or La Liga.  Love the Strikers for what they are and the fun they can provide you now.  They may not be the greatest (yet), but they are ours.  Considering the history of this sport down here treat them as the precious commodity they are...

This was the third game I took my kids and a friend.  Man we're they excited to see goals poured in the second half.  My 5 year old son was really annoyed with the group of kids behind us blowing plastic horns and cheering for Minnesota.  Love his passion for the Strikers.

Buy your kids some vuvuzulas and passionately honk louder for the Strikers...
I think there are more than a few of us that have a passion for this team.  Just keep spreading the word about them.

Vuvuzuelas are banned in my household.  Imagine the headache I'd get for give a 5 year old and a 3 year old a loud hourn to blow.  He did yell "No Way Jose!" evertime after they said "Lets Go Minnesota!".

LOL.....I see your point about the vuvuzuelas.  I think that they are banned from Al Lang Field in St Pete when FCTB plays there.  Along with drums..
"No way, Jose!" pretty much covers all that a 5 year old can reply to a traveling fan.  In a few more years he may get a bit more forceful, but, for now, that will do nicely...
Now, if they can only keep the love & passion for their team for awhile longer.

I think the passion and love for the game will be there for them when they get older.  It seems to be a genetic thing from what I've seen so far.

Of all the games I had to miss!
Looks like it was tons of fun and who has a picture of Chris giving beer to Yossimar Granado after his goal?
I'll be at all the rest of the games for sure!
I did get to go to the Gold Cup games on Friday at FIU and here is my take on it with pictures. Over 18,000 showed up.

I noticed that Shriver got a lot of well deserved press about subbing in and scoring, but the person that was dominant throughout the whole game was #7 Le Petit.  That's the type of midfield player I've been waiting to see the whole season and he was amazing!  He posessed the ball very well and had excellent touch on his passes.  He was always looking to attack or find runners on the move.

Great game and great night out!  Hopefully the dip in attendance was due to weather and the gold cup matches being played in the area... Can't wait for the next match!

Good show.  The time spent with Tim Robbie was very informative in so, so many ways, including his take on the attendance dip.  Keep up the good work.
