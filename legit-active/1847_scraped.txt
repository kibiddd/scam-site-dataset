Premiere
This film, a raw howl of outrage and pain, is proudly one-sided, allowing a generation of wounded men and women to scream their betrayal.

Slate
Wrenching new documentary about returning veterans, may not single-handedly reverse the trend of ignoring Iraq docs in theatrical release, but it should.

Los Angeles Times
This thoughtful, sensitive film, perhaps the most emotionally wrenching of all the Iraq documentaries, could have been made after any war.

Film Threat
Far from being a mere polemic, The Ground Truth is bolstered immeasurably by Foulkrod’s almost exclusive use of interviews with actual veterans.

Foulkrod's film instead airs some of the hard-won truths learned by American soldiers from experience.

Village Voice
The details are eye-opening (or ear-opening, in the case of marching songs taught to the new Marines about slaughtering Arab schoolchildren), but soon Foulkrod's film backs itself into a Support Our Troops corner.

I wonder how the protagonists of this movie are regarded by the rest of the folks on active duty, and the vets. Who needs yet another tearjerker about some individuals not being able to handle the consequences of war ? Yes, war is terrible, yes, war kills innocents - what else is new ? What is the purpose of making your fellow soldiers look like child killers without a conscience ? I am in no way pro military, and I am against it neither. This is just way too biased. They should have try to make this movie more balanced.
