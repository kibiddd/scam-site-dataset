Descendants of George Henry Gottschalk—Kansas Priests and Nuns in our history Index of Families DEDICATION To all our parents , grandparents, who inspired us with their courage and good example, and above all, who kept our religious heritage in highest esteem, we dedicate this volume, so as an humble return of our love and gratitude. LEGEND OF SIGNS AND SYMBOLS 1) In This book, every name is followed by a date, which always signifies the date of birth. 2) 2) Within each of the 5 main branches, each child will be given its own special serial number, which will also be used to identify the child and sits spouse when they are listed as a family. All married persons can thus be traced back to the family which they were born. 3) 3) 00=this sign indicates “double rings” and is a symbol of marriage. 4) 4) ==this cross, following a name, indicated that they are deceased, and the date following, when available, and tells of the date of death. FOREWARD With the celebration of the Bi-Centennial year of our Country, many documents and date have come alive, to awaken in the minds of our American citizens how rich their heritage over the past two hundred years has been. It makes people more proud of their Country, and spurs them on to learning more about its history. In the same spirit, many family histories have appeared in print in recent years to motivate, to remind the present generation and those yet to come, just who their ancestors were, from where they originated and what kind of people their forefathers really were. It has been a matter of great curiosity for me over a span of years, to wish for a clearer picture of our own Gottschalk relationship. For many years my relives have suggested that somebody should make this research! It is difficult for me to understand how George Henry Gottschalk (188 to 1917), with his education and years of teaching, never thought to set to writing the history of his family, together with the migration of his three brothers and himself over to America. , beginning with the year 1867. The written documents and information and of those years in our relationship were, to say the least very meager. Over the last fifteen years, this feeling of curiosity that possessed me became a determined desire to find an answer. It became clearer to me, that if there was to be a Family Tree Record, I had better take the task in hand now. Being inexperienced in this type of work the beginnings were naturally difficult and disheartening, because I could not find sources of information about whether there were relatives of our Grandparents will living in Germany, and if so, what was their present address. Without this first step, I knew there would be no adequate “Family Story”. At least three or four persons going to Germany had promised me an honest search in the area of Osnabrueck, but it always ended in failure. In May of 1973, I met a man in Victoria, Kansas, named Mr. Heinrich Witteman, whose wife was a nice to Fr. Jordon Hammel, Capuchin. This gentleman was from Mannheim, Germany, working in the Police Department. He listened to my story of frustrations, and then made me a solemann promise to make a thorough search in the Remsede, Germany, area, where our grandparents were born and raised. This was in May. His promise was” You will hear from me,” Nothing happened for eight months, and I thought it would end in the usual failure. Suddenly in January a letter arrived from Germany, telling me that Mr. Witteman had located a living relatiutiveve in that area, named Elizabeth Gottschalk, age 74 years, together with her address. I wasted no time writing alerter to her, explaining my projected Family Tree. Very quickly, Elizabeth Gottschalk’s married daughter, Hedwig Holtmeier, answered my letter, assuring me that her grandparent and pours were truly brothers. The rest of the history is in the first portion of our genealogy, Mrs. Holtmeir very graciously got all possible records from the old parish church, and whose records date back three hundred years. Through her efforts we have all the information from the home of our grandparents that was possible to find. It remained bow only to gather the information of the relatives in Pittsburg, Pa., and the Kansas area, which make up the contents of these books. HE NAME “Gottschalk” HAS A VERY ANCENT AND INTERESTING ORIGIN. Because OF ITS CENTURIES OF USE AND ABUSE. It is not too surprising to find that ITS CORRECT SPELLING MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH. It contains two words: “Gott” and “Schalk.” The word Gott obviously means Gods. The problem arises with the second word “Schalk.” This is the crucial word, in old English writings, this word appeared with precisely the same spelling as in the family name, and it meant simply “servant.” Men, who worked in the service of royalty or people of greater means and wealth, were called “Schalks. This word was taken forever into the early German language with the same meaning of servant. In later years, the meaning of Schalk grew to take the meaning of a mischievous fellow. In very early centuries in Germany, the name Gottschalk appeared as a family name, meaning very simply “God’s servant.” Through the centuries, this name took on many variations in spelling, due to doubt, to the fact that names were carelessly written as they sounded, or the fact that many people simply could not spell their name correctly. The word “Gott” alone, sometimes appears as “Got.” “God,” “Gad,” “Cut,” or “Gat.” The second wor5d, “Schalk” appears in many more variations, for example,” “Schlat,” “Schall,” “Schalck,” or Shalk.” It you join these two words in all their possible variations; you can understand why the family name took on endless variety of spellings. It might be of interest to mention some people in early history bore this name. 1. Gottschalk of Orbits, who lived from 803 to 869, a Benedictine monk and theologian. He defected from the Catholic Church mainly because of his false teachings on the doctrine of Predestination. 2. 2. Gottschalk of Limburg, Germany. He lived from 1010 to 1098. He was a poet. 3. 3. HISOTRY OF THE GOTTSCHAL NAME AND COAT OF ARMS THE REMSEDE AREA Remsede is a small village, which is situated in the northern section of Germany, at the end of the Teutoburg forest, surrounded on both sides at the base of a series of low foot hills. The big city of Osnabrueck is just 13 miles to the north, a city of about 150,000 inhabitants. Remsede was always a rather small rural village, and at the present time there are only about 800 inhabitants. It is a lush farm area which is set back from any heavy highway traffic. Up until a few years ago, Remsede was an independent town, but in recent years they joined three little villages under one mayor. The area is now called Laer-Remsede. The two little towns are about two miles apart. In earlier 1800, the address for Remsede inhabitants was written in this way: Kingdom of Hannover, Principality of Osbabrueck, and town of Remsede. Hence you see that Remsede used to belong to the Kingdom of Hannover, not the town of Hannover. This led some of our relatives to say that our ancestry was from Hannover, Germany, which was not too accurate. The nearest large city, Osbabrueck, is just 13 miles to the north. Most of their business, advanced schooling, and other needs, were taken care of in this large city. On the map of Germany, just look for Osnabrueck, and Remsede is just 13 miles due south. In modern West Germany, the country is divided into States, similar to our division in America. Remsde is in the state known as Lower Saxony. The pictures in this chapter show you: 1) The picture of the little village 2) A composite of four buildings in the town 3) A picture of their very famous, ancient church 4) An aerial view of the home, just outside Remsede, of our earliest known relatives. The white portion of the building was the original home, and a portion in dark, has been added in the course of time. "Today the home is no longer in existence. All members of the first family were born and raised in this home. One of the most unique buildings in Remsede is the little parish church, under the patronage of St. Augustine. In 1935 they celebrated the eleven hundred the year of it counting. What makes it so unique is that is became an official pilgrimage chapel. It is quite authentic, that this altar was built back in the year 734. Many people from as far as Cologne made pilgrimages to this highly indulged chapel. Pictures show its earliest form with the tall, spire, but in recent years a new tower has been built, giving it a different look. The pictures of the village will give you some idea of the lovely, quiet Remsede, in which our early grandparents lived their early lives. Being nestled in this valley-like forest, away from the thoroughfare, it is easy to see that they loved its quiet and peaceful retreat. The Beginning of the Gottschalk Genealogy Since the parish of St. Anthony's at Remsed was a Pilgrimage Chapel over the centuries, all of the church records for both Remsed and Laer, Germany, were kept in the St. Mary's Parish Church records for both Remsede and Laer, Germany, about two and a half miles from Remsede. In these books, which date back three hundred years, the following is written by its pastor: "The oldest entries at Laer, with the family name of "Gottschalk" date back to the year 1794." The very first parents found in that area were: Anton Gottschalk and A. Catherina Leinker There is no record of where they came from, or who their forbearers were. They simply appeared suddenly, with the baptism of their son, Bernhard Heinrich Gottschalk who is the ancestor of all the Gottschalk’s mentioned in this book. Whether or not they had other children is unknown.

Wilhelm Ludwig Gottschalk May 9, 1844 to Jul 22, 1877 HEINRICH CLEMENS AUGUST GOTTSCHALK was the eleventh child born of the union to Bernard and Anna Maria (Hagedown) Gottschalk, of Remsede, Germany. Of the five boys who survived birth and were married, August Gottschalk was the only one to remain in Germany. He inherited the home where the family was born and raised. He most likely had military service in the German army, and when he retired from that, he took up the trade of farmer, village official and father. In the earlier years after the brothers separated, there was some communication between August and those in the United States. Unfortunately it did not continue, so that the only information remaining to us in the United States was the fact that there were relatives in Germany. Fortunately, Father Timothy succeeded in making contact with them, and as a result we have the complete record of the first family in our genealogy.

Petra Brunke Jul 12, 1960 BERNARD HEINRICH GOTTSCHALK was the oldest of the four boys who came to America August 17, 1867. Also it states that he was married in Breese, Illinois, and Nov. 28, 1867. We have a strong suspicion that he came alone, and that the other brothers followed later. Before leaving his home stead, his records tell of his freely enlisting in 1st K.D.R. (A German army regiment) of the Hanover Germany Government. This enlistment lasted from 1855 to 1856. Shortly thereafter, he set sails to America. Not too long after his marriage in Breese, Ill., he came to Pittsburg, Pa., where he finally made his permanent home, and raised a large family of 14 children. Unfortunately, so many of the children died in early age, or infancy. His must have been a distressing life, since only five of the large family became of marriageable age, and did marry. He did visit his brother George Henry in Schoenchen, Kansas once. They also corresponded very much by mail and their letter were very lengthy and of a very spiritual nature.

In the family record, kept in the Family Bible of Bernard Henry Gottschalk, the name Mary Regina Gottschalk does appear, born on the same date as that of Mary Regina Gottschalk. Anna Maria, however, died on October 1, 180, and Mary Regina lived a long married life. The Grandchildren of Mary Regina insist that she belongs to the family of Bernard Henry Gottschalk, but we cannot find her baptismal certificate. We have accepted the word of the grandchildren, and concluded that Anna Maria and Mary Regina Gottschalk were twins. 8. FAMILY OF JACOB CARL BONGARTZ FATHER: Jacob C.
