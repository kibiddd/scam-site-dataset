STEELE
Its
no real surprise that Bobs voice
may
sound familiar to you. You probably have heard it before. Hes a
career broadcaster, whos voiced thousands of radio and television
commercials. He enjoyed creating great commercials so much at work, that
six years ago, he decided to make available to the world his excitement
and passion for a great sounding spot. He built a home studio, and
Bobzilla Radio Creative was born.
