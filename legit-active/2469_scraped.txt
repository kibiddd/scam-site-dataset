Open-ended discussion on teenage drinking.
ShotlistGROUP OF TEEN-AGERS DISCUSS USE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES PRESENT VARIOUS OPINIONS. IN CONCLUSION THEIR POINTS OF VIEW ARE SUMMARIZED & QUESTION IS LEFT OPEN FOR AUDIENCE TO DISCUSS. PRODUCED IN COOPERATION WITH YALE CENTER FOR ALCOHOL STUDIES.
Ken Smith sez: "The gang" sits around at a party and air their thoughts about drinking (after all, this is one of the Discussion Problems In Group Living series).  One talks directly to the camera; otherwise, it's all yackity-yack.  Produced in cooperation with the Yale Center for Alcohol Studies (see Teaching Teen-Agers About Alcohol).

of Gilby's gin. Both cases resulted in the worst hangover you ever had (except in my case, one year later, one 8 oz glass of Mohawk blackberry brandy gave me the dry heaves for two days, not to mention, I was supposed to get my cherry broke by the man of my dreams (the boy next door; his parents were out of town), but No! My mother heard me puking my guts out in the next door neighbors' bathroom, and came and got me. Put the kabash on that! See? One drink ruined my whole life. 65, no man, and still a virgin.That's how you decide whether drinking is for you or not. Annoying film. (And, btw, I only drink top shelf vodka - Skyy, to be specific; no rot gut for me, as I sit here reviewing that unfortunate incident; yeah...you'd drink too)

literally a discussion film, with the majority of the film's ten minutes spent with six or seven twangy Kansas teens sitting in a living room talking and arguing about the pros and cons of alcohol, after they find out some of their friends have been arrested for DUI. Almost everything you could talk about is covered (and one guy compares alcoholism to eating too many pickles). The film is actually fairly well-done, with only the overacting of several of the young cast members seriously detracting from the short's quality. The kid who played the Nixon-ish Johnny in "Cheating" two years earlier appears here as the guy whose father is an alcoholic. The chubby man who is beaten and mugged by a gang of young punks in "What About Juvenile Delinquency?" is the pickle kid's dad here. Shelby Storck, an actor from Kansas City, plays a doctor who chats about alcoholism with the boy from "Cheating". Storck also stars in the Calvin film "Coffee Break" and others. David Agee is the name of the kid who plays Jerry, who doesn't have an opinion on drinking and at the end poses the classic Centron question to the viewer: "What do you think?" According to Centron production records, "What About Drinking?" was produced by Art Wolf, directed by Herk Harvey, and written by Trudy Travis and Art Wolf, with photography by Norm Stuewe and sound and editing by Chuck Lacey and Art Wolf. Dan Palmquist was assistant director. Recommended.

having and finds out that 2 of their classmates were drunk and hit a pedestrian with their car. Instead of reacting with horror, the Kansas kids say, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂGoshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ, in probably one of the worst acting IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve ever seen. This soon spills into a conversation about the demon liquor, some kids, like Sally, insist alcohol is the root of all evil, and then thereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Ted who, in a sudden burst of over-actitis, starts talking a storm about why heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs in favor of teen drinking. Make sure you catch the flashback scene with Jack and his Dad when Dad AWESOMELY says, with tears almost in his eyes, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa drink before dinner in the evening is just about the best thing I know of to settle your nerves and give you an appetite.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ HUH?? WOW. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a quote!! Almost as equal with JackÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs insistence that pickles arenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt bad for you, but if you eat too many, youÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre bound to get sick! Everyone else has an opinion, but I donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt know, I think I want to join that hyperventilave Jack in that pre-dinner pro-pickle cocktail hour..This is a MUST see on this site!!

Bob and Ted's Excessive Adventure

Mostly bad acting, but a fair presentation about alcohol use for it's time, with the kids taking the positions advocated by a parent or religious leader: Ok in moderation, always wrong, unhealthy, neutral . . . unlike the teens I grew up with, no advocate for getting blasted. Rational Jerry recaps their positions, then, inevitably: "What do you think?"
