Career Highlights
Scored his first NHL goal in front of 6,000 fans at Civic Arena, helping
Red Kelly get first win as Penguins head coach on Nov. 1, 1969. Briere's
goal came in the same game in which linemate Dean Prentice scored his 300th
career NHL goal. After the game, Prentice tod reporters he felt Briere had a
bright future in the league and would likely score 300 goals in his own NHL
career. ... Led Pittsburgh with 32 assists as rookie in 1969-70. ... Scored series-clinching
goal at 8:28 of overtime to give Pittsburgh a best-of-7 sweep of Seals on
April 12, 1970, at Oakland. Briere's goal was the first overtime goal in Penguins
history, and it gave the team its first playoff series victory in what was also
its first trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs. ... Won Pittsburgh Rookie of
Year for 1969-70. The award was renamed in his memory the following year.
Retired Sweater Number
Following Briere's tragic death, no Pittsburgh player wore the No.
21 again, as the number was unofficially retired without any sort of
ceremony. The only item commemorating the number was a framed  No. 21
jersey in the Igloo Club at the arena. As the 30th annniversary of Briere's death approached, the
Penguins held a special pregame ceremony before their Jan. 5, 2001, home
game vs. Montreal, to formally raise the No. 21 to the
rafters of Civic Arena. It became the only number hanging in the rafters at
the time, since Mario Lemieux's No. 66 had been taken down nine days earlier
to celebrate Lemieux's NHL comeback.
The
Death of Michel BriereMichel Briere's promising NHL career came to a
sudden and tragic end when a May 15, 1970, auto accident caused
head injuries that put him into a coma for several months until his
death. The crash happened eight miles north of his native Malartic,
Quebec, where he had returned after his rookie season to make plans for
his June 6, 1970, marriage to Michelle Beaudoin, with whom he already had
a son. He purchased a new car with the bonus money he had earned from
the 1970 playoffs. Not long after he bought it, Briere lost control of
it during a late afternoon drive on Highway 117 and crashed into a tree.
Driving fast on Highway 117 was not common, but there was a
bend in the road that caused problems for drivers at high speed.
Briere's car went off the road at that spot. Briere was thrown from the
car, and his head smashed into a nearby rock. Two other men, Renald
Bilodeau, Briere's best friend, and Yvon Fortin, were also in the car
and were also injured. There was even some question as to whether or not
Briere was even driving the car at the time of the accident because both
Bilodeau and Fortin refused to tell police -- perhaps fearing criminal
charges in the case. Although
he was not killed instantly, Briere lapsed into a coma with a fractured
skull. Incredibly, as the ambulance containing Briere rushed to the
hospital, it struck and kiilled an 18-year-old named Reauld Perreault,
who was walking along the highway.
Briere was taken to Val d'Or, Quebec, and flown to Notre Dame Hospital
in Montreal, where he had a four-hour operation to to remove blood clots
from his brain. It was
immediately clear that he would not be playing hockey in 1970-71
although there was initial hope that he might regain consciousness. He
was given a 50-50 chance at such recovery. Briere had a second operation
on May 30, 1970, to remove another blood clot from his brain. He would
have two more such operations. There was a sense of hope in July that
Briere might recover, but by August, doctors at the hospital in Montreal
were publicly saying they did not know if he would ever come out of the
coma. His weight had dropped all the way down to 102 pounds as he was
fed intravenously and showed no signs of improvement. At that time,
doctors said he had only "very elementary reactions" to physiotherapy.
On Oct. 21, 1970, Briere turned 21 years old. By January 1971, there was no improvement in Briere's condition, and,
while praying for his recovery, team officials publicly stated that they
did not expect him ever to play hockey again if he were to come out of
the coma. At that time, the Penguins team visited Briere at the hospital
while they were in Montreal for a game against the Canadiens. Some of
the Pittsburgh players chose not to enter Briere's room, since they
wanted to remember him as they had known him and not see him in a
deteriorated state. Jack Riley, the Penguins Executive Director, and
head coach Red Kelly went int the room with Briere. "I talked to him and
Red talked to him," Riley told reporters Byron Yake. "We held his hand,
and sometimes you got the feeling he knew who you were." By March, his
condition had worsened, and death seemed imminent, although doctors said
he was still clearly fighting for his life. With little hope for his
survival, the decision was made to take Briere out of the hospital and
transfer him to a Montreal convalescent home on March 27, 1971. On April 4, 1971, Pittsburgh fans
honored Briere at Mellon Arena by announcing him as the winner of the
James G. Balmer plaque for contributions to Pittsburgh hockey. On the
afternoon of April
13, 1971, weighing only 60 pounds, Briere passed away. Between May 15,
1970, and his death 11 months later, Briere was never said to be fully
conscious although his eyes remained open, and his fiancee later said he
appeared very sad and cried on a day when she thought he had improved
enough to bring his skates into
the hospital room.•
