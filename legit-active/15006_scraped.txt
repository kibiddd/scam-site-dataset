Poor acting all the way throughout, mediocre action sequences, and to much of an original plot.If you find yourself extremely bored and with absolutely nothing to do then watch this.Too many wrestlers who want to be actors nowadays and this film does nothing for the acting of Rob Van Dam or Dave Bautista.Less than thrilling in it's sequence of movement. The only thing I found interesting in this film was the cars and bikes. I have come to the conclusion with the Rock being the exception to the rule is that wrestlers need not go into acting.torstensonjohnDec 7, 2012PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 23, 2010 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asThị Trấn Tội LỗiFilming locationsRaleigh Studios Baton Rouge, Celtic Media Centre, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA(Studio)Production companyFilms In MotionSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$870,000 (estimated)See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 28 minutesColorColorAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page
