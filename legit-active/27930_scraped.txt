The body of Juan Mendez, 21, was recovered about 200 feet south of the Gregory Street Bridge, a spokesman for the Passaic County Sheriff’s Department said.
Mendez was last seen early April 25, when he left a Passaic home with his niece, Janiay Rievas, and told relatives to “watch the 6 o’clock news tonight.” Her body was recovered from the river that night. The car Mendez was driving was found on the bridge.
Mendez had been living in the same Passaic home as the girl and her mother.
