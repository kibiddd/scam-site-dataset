Chief executive officer
A chief executive officer (CEO in American English) or managing director (MD in British English) describes the position of the most senior corporate officer, executive, or administrator in charge of managing an organization. The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity. Titles also often given to the holder of the CEO position include president and chief executive (CE).
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's legal structure. They can be far-reaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority.
Typically, the CEO/MD has responsibilities as a director, decision maker, leader, manager and executor. The communicator role can involve the press and the rest of the outside world, as well as the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy. As a leader of the company, the CEO/MD advises the board of directors, motivates employees, and drives change within the organization. As a manager, the CEO/MD presides over the organization's day-to-day operations.
The term refers to the person who takes  all the decisions regarding the upliftment of the company, which includes all sectors and fields of the business  like operations, marketing, business Development, finance, Human resources, etc.  The CEO of a company is not necessarily the owner of the company.

Prime Minister of Pakistan
The Prime Minister of Pakistan (Urdu: وَزِیرِ اَعظَم‎ — Wazīr-ē Aʿẓam, Urdu pronunciation: [ʋəˈziːr-ˌeː ˈɑː.zəm]; lit. "Grand Vizier"), is the head of government of Pakistan and designated as the "chief executive of the Republic." The Prime minister leads the executive branch of the government, oversees the economical growth, heads the Council of Common Interests as well as the Cabinet, and is vested with the command authority over the nuclear arsenals.
This position places its holder in leadership of the nation who has control over all matters of internal and foreign policy. The incumbent Prime Minister is Nawaz Sharif– a presiding figure of the conservative Pakistan Muslim League (N). Usually, a leader of the majority party in the parliament, the Prime Minister is directly elected through a popular vote and landslide victory by the people and is a senior member of the National Assembly. The Constitution of Pakistan vests the executive powers to the Prime minister and is responsible for appointing the Cabinet as well as running the executive branch, taking and authorising executive decisions, appointments and recommendations that require executive confirmation of the Prime Minister.

Chief Executive Officer (Afghanistan)
The Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is position within the Government of Afghanistan. The extra-constitutional post was created in September 2014 following the disputes that arose after the 2014 Afghan presidential election when both Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah claimed victory in that election. As part of a national unity agreement, it was agreed that Ashraf Ghani would assume the presidency and a new post of Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan would be created for Abdullah Abdullah.
Roles and responsibilities
The Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan chairs a weekly meeting of a Ministers' Council which can make policy recommendations to the President. The Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan can also recommend ministers for the Cabinet of Afghanistan, a body chaired by the President.
The national unity agreement calls for a meeting of the Loya Jirga within two years to consider the need for the re-creation of a post of Prime Minister within the Afghan Government.

Executive officer
An executive officer (often abbreviated XO) is generally a person responsible for running an organization, although the exact nature of the role varies depending on the organization.
Administrative law
While there is no clear line between executive or principal and inferior officers, principal officers are high-level officials in the executive branch of U.S. government such as department heads of independent agencies. In Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers by stating that the former serve at the pleasure of the president and may be removed at his discretion. The latter may be removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress. The decision by the Court was that the Federal Trade Commission was a quasi-legislative body because of other powers it had, and therefore the president could not fire an FTC member for political reasons. Congress can’t retain removal power over officials with executive function (Bowsher v. Synar). However, statutes can restrict removal if not purely executive (Humphrey’s executor), but can't restrict removal of purely executive officer (Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)). The standard is whether restriction "impedes the president’s ability to perform his constitutional duty" (Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988)).

Chief executive (Irish local government)
In local government in the Republic of Ireland, the chief executive of a city or county is the senior permanent official of its local authority. Whereas the county council and city council are elected officials who formulate policy, the chief executive is an appointed official who manages the implementation of policy. The position was introduced in 1929–42 based on the American council–manager government model, and until 2014 the chief executive was styled the county manager or city manager.  Their salaries range from €132,511 to €189,301 per annum.  The County and City Management Association (formerly the  County and City Managers' Association) is the professional association for chief executives, and it is affiliated to the International City/County Management Association (ICMA).
History
The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 established elected county and town councils with executive authority, with the Local Government Board for Ireland having the power to dissolve councils which did not comply with their statutory obligations. After the Irish Free State was established in 1922, the Local Government Board's functions were taken by the Minister for Local Government. During and immediately after the Irish Civil War, the Minister dissolved several councils, including those of Dublin and Cork cities, and replaced each with an  unelected commissioner. In both cities, there was a body of opinion that the services provided by the councils were delivered more efficiently and fairly under the commissioners than under the previous system, where the executive function had been, in effect, vested in the councils and their committees.

A Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is the highest-ranking official in a company, holding the primary position of authority and responsibility. The CEO plays a pivotal role in corporate governance, serving as the bridge between the company's operations and its Board of Directors. This position isn't bestowed lightly, as it involves several key aspects: Election Process: The CEO is elected through a shareholder vote, receiving the endorsement of the Board of Directors. This election process underscores the importance of selecting the right leader for the company. Diverse Titles: CEOs are often associated with various titles such as Managing Director, Chairman, or President. Regardless of the title, the CEO remains the company's top executive and reports to the Board of Directors. Stakeholder Influence: CEOs who have a significant stake in the company, such as founding CEOs, sometimes hold considerable influence over the Board through the voting system. The role of a CEO carries a great deal of responsibility. With power comes accountability, and CEOs shoulder a substantial burden of ensuring the company's success: Strategic Leadership: The CEO plays a central role in shaping the company's short-term and long-term strategies. This involves setting the direction and goals for the business. Management Oversight: CEOs are tasked with managing other managers responsible for various facets of the organization, including production, marketing, sales, administration, and public relations. Delegating Authority: Effective CEOs know the importance of delegating authority to their teams, empowering them to make decisions and implement strategies. This delegation expedites decision-making and fosters better results. Vision Crafting: A CEO is also responsible for crafting a compelling vision for the organization, one that inspires and guides the company towards its objectives. Human Capital Development: Nurturing a strong human capital within the organization is essential. This means fostering the growth and development of employees, adapting to changing business environments, and ensuring a robust workforce. In conclusion, the role of a CEO is multi-faceted and crucial to a company's prosperity. As the highest authority in the organization, CEOs are not just leaders but visionaries who set the course for the business's future.

Chief executive officer
A chief executive officer (CEO in American English) or managing director (MD in British English) describes the position of the most senior corporate officer, executive, or administrator in charge of managing an organization. The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity. Titles also often given to the holder of the CEO position include president and chief executive (CE).
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's legal structure. They can be far-reaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority.
Typically, the CEO/MD has responsibilities as a director, decision maker, leader, manager and executor. The communicator role can involve the press and the rest of the outside world, as well as the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy. As a leader of the company, the CEO/MD advises the board of directors, motivates employees, and drives change within the organization. As a manager, the CEO/MD presides over the organization's day-to-day operations.
