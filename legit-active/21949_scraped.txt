A little about the
superstar:
Luna Vachon, daughter of Paul "Butcher"
Vachon and niece of Maurice "Mad Dog" Vachon,
and Vivian Vachon, comes from a family
tradition steeped in the guts and glory of
the squared circle.  This tradition, combined
with her "take no prisoners" attitude and her
fearless determination to be herself, have
produced a spectacular talent unlike any
other in the WWF.
She stands as heir to
the legacy of the
Fabulous Moolah, Mae Young, her aunt Vivian
Vachon and all the other women who grappled
in carnival tents and smoky lodge halls in
years past.  Thanks to her self-proclaimed
"mean genes", Luna is the fiercest and most
feared competitor in the world of female
wrestling today.
Luna Vachon provides
credibility to the
WWF Women's Division and we look forward for
her to fight for and win the womens
championship gold in the near future. She has
earned it.
