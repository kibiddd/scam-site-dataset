In this ending, Chrissie gets in the car after escaping from the meat factory and Leatherface is not in the back seat, but then Leatherface saws through the window with the chainsaw and he kills Chrissie.This ending is the same as the theatrical ending, but Leatherface stabs Chrissie with a knife through her chest, instead of ramming the chainsaw through her stomach.Also the same as the theatrical ending, but not with the voice over from John Larroquette, but with subtitles insteadConnectionsFeatured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: The Departed/Open Season/The Guardian/The Last King of Scotland/The Queen/School for Scoundrels/Beerleague (2006)SoundtracksAll Right NowWritten by Paul Rodgers and Andy FraserPerformed by FreeCourtesy of Universal-Island Records Ltd.Under license from Universal Music EnterprisesCopyright 1970 (Renewed) Fairwest Music USA (BMI)o/b/o Blue Mountain Music, Ltd.User reviews439ReviewFeatured reviewWelcome to Texas!I saw this when i was in L.A. screening my own horror short October 2006. It was at the Chinese theater, and i was so delighted that i'm still talking about it. I love the original and the remake, and i feel the same way with this one. It shows how f****d up things can get when you accidentally end up in places you shouldn't be. Ermey is a true horror star, and really shows of here. This is a very gory film, and those of you who can't watch much blood, stay away:) For those of you who can, come on in!!! :) When i watched it i almost felt that it might turn me off of making horror films, but the feeling of course came right back:) Leatherface shows no mercy! Just as us horror freaks like it. The thing that shocked me was that i heard that they cut 17 scenes to get it an R-rating? Then i'm thinking, i can't wait to see what they cut. Hopefully the DVD will show us the goods. This might sound dumb coming from a horror fan of a long time, but i hope they make another one:)EskenNov 22, 2006PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ23How long is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning?Powered by AlexaIs Leatherface mentally challenged?How did Leatherface's evil family become cannibals?Where were Jedediah and Henrietta?DetailsEditRelease dateOctober 6, 2006 (Canada)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asMassacre à la tronçonneuse: Le commencementFilming locationsElgin, Texas, USAProduction companiesNew Line CinemaPlatinum DunesNext EntertainmentSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$16,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$39,517,763Opening weekend US & Canada$19,150,000Oct 8, 2006Gross worldwide$51,764,406See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 31 minutesColorColorSound mixDTSSDDSDolby DigitalAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006) in India?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
