WHY TXODDS?
Consistency
Our odds delivery is the fastest on the market – but speed is no good without accuracy. We take pride and care in our data quality, and offer all of this with unrivalled uptime.
Individuality
In a world where many odds and bookmakers have become increasingly generic, we give you the tools to stand out from the crowd by helping you create a bespoke product suited to your client base.
Efficiency
We have created a set of tools that make it easy for you to categorise and filter your odds data to work smartly for you.
We then offer you round-the-clock support to make sure that everything is working and delivering at all times.
TRUSTED BY:
“Our vision is to connect the sports betting ecosystem to the most compelling and innovative, ultra-low latency sports odds delivery platform”
