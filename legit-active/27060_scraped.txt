Maurice was a kind and gentle soul that was loved and admired by all who knew him.Olga T AntonettiJune 16, 2021Fr. Maurice was the best man I ever knew.Rosemary Carl RiveraAugust 6, 2011I have known Father Ouellet since Iwas about 6 or 7 years old.  We kids from Fowl  River, AL loved him.  He was good with kids.  He made cathechism classes so interesting.  He later visited me in the early 60's when I was a novice and a junior sister.  He was like my "adoptive parent" and visited me at the Daughter of the Holy Spirit Provincial House in Putnam, Ct on parents day while He was director of novices at Mystic, Ct.  He has been my mentor and spiritual director most of my life.  I am grateful to have known such a kind man of God and the other Edmundite priests at St. Margaret's mission church in Fowl River,AL.  I was blessed to attend his memorial in Selma, AL and it did give me some closure.  His words I remember was "to be happy and enjoy life". That is what we owe the world." Condolences and sympathy to his family, the Edmundite priests and friends.Robert WilliamsAugust 4, 2011Hello, I was baptized by Father Ouellet 30 sept 1955...He was a great influence on my life.
