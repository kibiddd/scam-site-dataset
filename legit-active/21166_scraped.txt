The Kristoff Ligero Criollo line was introduced back in 2008.  It is is a medium to full body smoke that will satisfy lots of cigar palates.  This cigar comes in several vitolas:  a Churchill (7 x 50); a Toro (6.5 x 56); a Torpedo (6.13 x 52), and today‚Äôs feature cigar a Robusto (5.5 x 54).  This cigar is a very pleasant, long smoke which does not disappoint.  The Criollo Robusto series contains 70% added Nicaraguan ligero which definitely contributes to the fullness of the cigar.  The Kristoff Ligero also comes in a Brazilian Maduro wrapper.
Appearance : [rating:5/5]
Esthetically, this is a very beautiful cigar; the head has a small pigtail, and it also has a covered shaggy foot which resembles the original Kristoff cigars.
The wrapper is brown with a few veins showing in the wrapper.
The color of the band is identical to that of the cigar, and it has the word ‚ÄúKristoff‚Äù in the center of the band.  It also has the phrase ‚ÄúElite Cuban Taste‚Äù on top of Kristoff with ‚ÄúLigero‚Äù at the bottom.
Construction : [rating:4/5]
The cigar feels firm to the touch; no soft spots were felt.
The pigtail was cut with a Palio cutter, and that exposed enough of a surface to produce a good draw.
During the smoke, the light grey ash showed a few loose spots, and it was also flaky.  A good 1.5 in ash was obtained prior to being tapped off in the ashtray.
The only deficiency in the construction was that the wrapper cracked during the last third of the smoke. The small crack was about 0.5 in.; however, no smoking issues developed as a result of the crack.
The cigar had a very nice and easy draw.  The cigar was pretty smoky and the smoke rose quickly.
The band was removed very easily, and none of it stuck to the cigar.
Flavor : [rating:5/5]
During pre-light, the cigar had a salty and spicy taste to the tongue.  Honey notes were detected on the draw prior to lighting the stick.
The initial taste after lighting it was that of leather.  At about 2 in. into the smoke, hints of wood primarily cedar were detected.
The cigar featured a fairly long finish; definitely, the leather was the predominant taste left in the mouth.
The presence of the added ligero definitely contributed to a very rich taste and the fullness of the smoke.
Value : [rating:5/5]
At about $6.50 per stick, this is a great value from Kristoff.  For the money spent, one gets a cigar of good appearance, fairly good construction, and a great flavor profile.
Overall Rating : [rating:4.5/5]
This cigar offers a great smoking experience.  It is an excellent companion to a good port wine (Ruby or Tawny).  For those looking to get into full body cigars, this is a good one to have in your humidor.  This cigar will not disappoint anyone, as it offers good value for such a good smoke.  Highly recommended!

Mormegil,
I would de-emphasize the star rating and focus on the narratives for each section.  It is there where I would give you a better criticism of the cigar.  The star rating is really subjective.  Thanks for following the reviews.

Ed, after reading your reviews on several cigars that I‚Äôve smoked I can‚Äôt help but think that you‚Äôre way too generous with lesser cigars.  If you smoked a turd, you‚Äôd probably give it three stars.  I understand that you wish to promote cigar sales, but you should be much, much more discerning.  To do otherwise is misleading and tends to help the unwary blow money on a sub-standard cigar.

Thank you for your review. Very informative. I really do enjoy these cigars. It is a cigar that everyone can enjoy from the seasoned pro to the first time smoker. I will continue to stock my humidor with these.

I have one of these in a larger size waiting to be enjoyed in my box.  However I must admit that I find it a bit intimidating.
