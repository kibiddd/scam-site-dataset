Heat wok with oil, swirling to coat sides. Stir-fry onion, ginger, mushrooms, cloud ear fungus, and green onion or chives for 2 minutes. Add remaining vegetables and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add broth, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and pepper. Bring to a boil and stir in cornstarch mixture. Cook until sauce thickens. Return noodles to wok and mix everything together. Drizzle in sesame oil, and top with sprigs of Chinese parsley. Serves 3 to 4. From In the Chinese Kitchen With Shirley Fong-Torres (Pacific View Press, copyright 1993 by Shirley Fong-Torres).
