Critics Consensus
Eagle Eye is a preposterously plotted thriller that borrows heavily from other superior films.

A warning about the threat in our own backyard -- but as often is the case with Hollywood blockbusters, the warning comes across more like fear-mongering than constructive social criticism. Personally, I prefer my cinema sans mongering.

Deep Focus Review
Some may be able to pull the plug on their sense of logic and enjoy the procession of inanity, but when it’s all over, the result isn’t nearly as interesting or as clever as it could be.
Rated: 2/4

Mysterious organization with god level powers controls everything and everyone like we’re all sims characters. So begs the question, why would such an organization need 2 people of zero natural abilities to suddenly do its bidding.

Does life be imitated by this film, "Eagle Eye," imitate life.
That is in and of itself a statement of trope or "tin hat" conspiracy theory, right? In that my inner self has thankfulness, thank you for your consideration of the following,
and in this hopefulness of the good today of days, in the impartiality of "correct" just peacefulness, each of us is entitled to observe.
There is no official, "Olive Stone book or film" *rule* of the enshrine Charters of Freedom, of the "Freedom" of information Act as part of the rule of law.  The "magic bullet theory" has not panned out someone named to have been in the grassy knoll.
This is only food for thought in the metaphorical nature of the film, "Eagle Eye," oh, it seems related to, "Criminal Minds," that aired on CBS. However, legal jurisprudence is a good thing, and store cams, street cams, Google Inc. "Earth" cams, and other live stream cams with facial recognition commonplace, give food for thought of the option to consume these real things in our societies in this historical setting.
The idea of "over the shoulder," in regard to someone volunteers personal life circumstances to someone,
- even someone that someone has known,
- of, had that person, of two in conversation(s), you and the "over the shoulder," type of "tracking" for "fishing,"
- and claims that the person has known you, and then gossips,
- then the person claimed the right to talk about you.
In legal jurisprudence to be compelled to a deposition,
to be deposed, requires at the very least an officer of the court,
*however*,
- the right of refusal is the person, of the standard,
- being held 24hrs to 72hr, of the right of counsel by a lawyer.
In history of how the stars in the skies got their, of the history of symbols used in communication, of "penned," goes back just over 6000 years at the cradles of human civilization,
- and, freedom of the *human nature* is inherent to each human being person, of free to believe in God.
The point has this,
* that I did not put the skies, nor the stars in the universe there,
- and I believe that nonsectarian,
- of that God being Eternal in a state of being,
- of true in personal belief that God put the skies and stars in place.
