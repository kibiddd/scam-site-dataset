That wonderful year 1907. Theodore Roosevelt was in the second half
of his second term as president, the engineers at Smith & Wesson were hard at work creating the .44 Special Triple-Lock and in Winterset,
Iowa, on the 26th of May, Mary Brown Morrison and her pharmacist husband
Clyde Morrison welcomed their first born. Marion Robed Morrison weighed
in at 13 pounds!
Apparently grandfather was not happy with the middle name so when a
younger brother arrived he was given the name of Robert while the first
boy became Marion Michael Morrison. He was destined to become the
largest presence to ever appear on the silver screen using a name
recognized and loved by countless millions of fans-John Wayne.
In 1912, due to health reasons, Clyde Morrison moved to California
to farm and his family followed two years later. In 1916 the farm failed
and the Morrison family moved to Glendale. Young Marion would go to
Glendale Union High School and then on to football fame at USC. Marion
now stood 6'4" and earned extra money while attending college
as a laborer on movie sets. His path soon crossed that of director John
Ford and he began doing bit parts and became friends with men whose
names would become familiar fixtures in his later films--Ward Bond,
Victor McLaglen, and George O'Brien.
[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
By 1929 Marion had become Duke Morrison and he was selected by
director Raoul Walsh to play the lead in the 1930 epic The Big Trail.
Talking pictures were only a few years old at this time and this was to
be a major production. Walsh gave the young actor a new name, John
Wayne, however audiences found the movie too slow and stardom eluded
him. For the next nine years John Wayne would find himself relegated to
fast-moving action-packed "B" Westerns. Then John Ford
re-entered the picture casting Wayne as the Ringo Kid in what would
prove to be one of the great Westerns of all time, Stagecoach.
The Duke's Battery
All through the 1930s John Wayne packed a Colt Single Action in a
typical Hollywood Buscadero holster rig. He was about to become a major
star with a different co-star. The opening scene of Stagecoach finds
John Wayne not with a Colt, but a Winchester--a very special Winchester.
Someone in the prop department came up with a unique idea. Ringo carried
a Winchester Model 1892 with a special large loop lever so it could be
twirled. The barrel was cut back from 20" to 18.5" and when
Wayne cocked his Winchester by twirling it, a star was born. That
special Winchester also became a part of many of John Wayne's
movies such as Hondo and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.
Thirty years after the John Wayne Winchester appeared in Stagecoach
it would help Wayne win his one and only Oscar in True Grit. Who can
ever forget the memorable scene as Rooster Cogburn faces the Ned Pepper
gang? Hopelessly outgunned, Rooster takes his reins in his teeth, his
sixgun in his left hand, twirls the Winchester in his right hand, and
rides to his Oscar. He should have won a second Oscar as the dying
gunfighter John Barnard Books in his last movie in 1976, The Shootist.
Wayne himself was suffering from a re-occurrence of cancer at the time.
He died in 1979.
Custom Grade
Commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the birth of
filmdom's greatest Western Star, Winchester is offering two
versions of the John Wayne Commemorative Rifle. The Custom Grade,
pictured, features gold embellishments with 1,000 examples being offered
at $3,499. The High Grade version will be offered for $1,999 with 4,000
units being manufactured. As somewhat of a connoisseur of grand
leverguns, I must say Winchester has really come up with a most fitting
tribute to John Wayne. This is one great-looking rifle!
High Grade
Manufactured by Miroku in Japan and offered by Browning, the High
Grade Winchester 1892 features an 18.5" blued barrel, very nicely
grained walnut stock and forearm, and a silver nickel nitride receiver.
The barrel bands and large loop lever are also satin nickeled. The rear
sight is of the ladder style and is matched up with a brass post front
sight, and a silver dollar-sized John Wayne medallion is set into the
right side of the buttstock. What really makes this levergun special is
the engraving found on both sides of the receiver.
On the right side we find The Duke holding his rifle with the words
"Courage," "Strength," and "Grit" along
with the initials "JW" surrounded by "John Wayne
Centennial" all on a scroll engraved background. The left side
carries out the theme with two pictures of Wayne on the engraved
background and the inscription "1907 John Wayne American
2007." One of the best indications this whole project was carried
out correctly is the fact it is chambered for the historically accurate
.44-40. Over the past few years, many replica Winchester and Colt
Lightning rifles have been introduced and almost always in the .45 Colt
cartridge which was never found in the originals. Winchester, Miroku,
and Browning have teamed up to do it correctly.
