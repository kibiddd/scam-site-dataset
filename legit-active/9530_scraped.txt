Retired stand-up comedian Ritch Shydner has been out of the business for more than a decade, but a comeback is on the horizon. Filmmaker Jordan Brady presents a telling character study of Shydner as he prepares, practices new material and confronts his fears of being out of touch with his audience. Behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with famous comedians like Tim Allen, Jim Gaffigan, Sarah Silverman and more offer insight into what works and what doesn't.

The first thing that a documentary about stand-up comedy ought to be is funny. Thankfully, I Am Comic succeeds handily on that count.

While offering a glimpse of stage routines, pic consists mostly of lively shop talk.

If you love standup comedy -- I mean, really love it -- then I Am Comic is a flawed must-see.

more like I am sorry...this documentary is weak and instead of focusing on the subject,it goes around trying to be funny and charming,without succeeding.just pretty damn forgettable.

A pretty solid doc about a lifestyle of an American stand up comedian. Often interviews are edited for comedic effect, rather than being more informative. The best part is that the film doubles as a doc about Ritch Shydner, who left "the game" long ago and now is trying to come back. So you get plenty of stuff between the both. A LOT of comedians were interviewed for this. RECOMMENDED.

*just* funny when it should have been hilarious, this is still required viewing for stand-up fans; only if they're new to the genre. Jordan Brady puts too much of himself in the film... A word of advice: of you're explaining something to the audience on camera, TAKE OUT YOUR F***ING HEADPHONES
