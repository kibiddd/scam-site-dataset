T}ie  first  authentic  record  of  the  Van  riorne
fainily  in  America,  is  found  undar  date  of  Tune  £6,,
1534jWhich  states  that  Jaques  Van  Vorne  and  Albert
K.  Bur 5}:,  "both  of  j'l-iQSterdain ,  Holland,  v/ere  a.  com-
mitter of  the  Eoard  of  Trade  on  Resolutions  in  re-
gard to  f oriiulcting'  a  plan  to  colonics  the  'fe\7
j-Tet  her  lands  .  It   seems   they    cane   to      JTew  j"ether-
lands  ('Tew  York)  and  sent  a  report  to  the  T7est
India  Company  of  Amsterdam,  Holland ,  aj'^ainst  the
private    complaints    of   the   Patroons.
^■'an  '■''oorn  of  AEsterdari,  "Tollar.d,  -Vcs  one  of
the  ^ouncil  of  that  cit;-  appointed  on  the  corinit-
tee  to  report  on  ti:e  condition  of  the  colony  on
the  hielaware  River,  Sept. 7, 1657.  As  it  was,  "Kot
the  Council's  intention  to  foster  the  colony  by  sx
cessive  and  endless  expenditure."  The  name  is  de-
rived froM  ?:corn,  a  larr;e,  ploaE£.nt  and  rich  city
on  the  Zuydsr  Zee  ahout  20  niles  froin  Ax-isterda:,!,
and  was  a  seaporo  of  importance  v/ith  10,000  inhab-
itants, t:-_e  ancient  capital  of  "".  Holland,  is  a
picturesque  cixy  with  numerous  quaint  old  build-
ings, the  walls  of  v/liich  s.re  ofren  elaborately
adorned  with  tiles.  Amon^v   t:  e  most      interesting-
are  the  ''"a^er  To"ver,on  the  bank  of  the  Zuyder  Zee;
the  Tom  Hall,  containiny  a  fe-»v  old  pictures;  the
St.    Jans    Inn;         and   tbe  Weigh   House.  The   Groote
Kerk  contains  a  monucicnt  to  Adiairal  Hlorissoon.
In  i;^73  a  naval  an^agej^^ent  took  place  off  Hoorn
betv;een  the  Lutch  and  the  Spaniards,  vvlien  the  ad-
miral in  coi^-iand  of  the  latter  wa.s  taken  prisoner.

coiii::unicate   with    the    road    oy      tiny   bridges.  The
city  wa.s  surrounded  "by  hroad  dykes  for  its  secur-
ity,  laTi^e  pasture  ^-irou.nds  for  its  profit,  and
fine  gardens  and  ".vallcs  for  its  pleasure.  Its
traffic  consisted  mostly  irx  butter  and  cheese  of
which  lar.-re  quantities  v;-ere  taken  into  Spain.  The
name  v/as  •'OT'itten  "'oorn  or  "ooren  and  wa,s  known  as
early  as  the  elevep.th  century.  The  fe.nily  V7as  one
of  the  Hiost  illustrious  in  F^urope,  and  by  inter-
marriage became  widely  connected  with  the  highest
nobility.
It  is  of  record  that  under  an  edict  of  the
States  C-eneral  of  Jlolland,  dated  harch  27,  1614,
five  vessels  sailed  for  Manha.t  tan ;  one  of  these
was  named  the  "fortune"  and  sailed  froK  T-Toorn,  a
port  in  JTorthern  3-Iolland  with  Cornelius  "^acobsen
Mey,  as  navigator;  they  iiiade  a  few  discoveries
and  gave  up  the  work;  ITavi^^ator  '^ey  took  it  up
a":ain  in   lo£0.
-he  freedom  of  the  city  is  the  riQ;ht  of
enjoying  all  the  privilep;es  and  imnunities  be-
longing: to  it,  to  the  exclusion  of  all  who  ara
not    Freemen .  In   eai'ly   days    in   cities,    municipal
corporations  and  borous;^hs,  it  v.-as  obtained  ei  tlier
by  serving  an  apprenticeship,  ^or  a  certain  tiLie,
or  by  the  pa^Taent  of  money  in  such  araounts  as
were  fixed  by  the  corporate  authorities  under
their  charter;  and  it  was  also  conferred  in
tLieir  discretion,  by  a  vote,  as  a  municipal  com-
pliment or  honor.  In  Holland  it  was  termed
"Burij'her  riecht"  or  J3urcer  Right  and  was  of  t  ;o
classes;  Great  Surgher  Right,  and  Snie-ll  Burgher
Right,  according;  to  the  amounts  of  money  paid  and
privileges  granted.  The  areat  Bxxr-jieT  Right  was
also  conferred  ex  officio  upon  the  Magistrates,
the  l^utch  Clergy,  a,nd  the  high  civil  and  military
officers  of  tl-.e  city  or  state.  It  was  a  most
important    r;rivile£;e  and  monopoly,      for      none        but
VAIT        HORI^E
its  possessors  could  practice  trades  or  do  any
mercantile  business  in  the  pla.ce,  possess  the
right  of  suffrage,  or  "be  eligible  to  election  to
public  office,  or  other  civic  honors.  As  such
it  was  established  and  existed  under  '.he  laitch
Government      in     New  Amsterdan,      in  Hew  iletherland.

JOEIS    TA>'Zji]'   VAJT  HOR?rE,
It  is  prol-lematical  if  -Toris  ^pAizen^hy  which
nax.-ie  t?ie  founder  of  this  fa,:nily  was  fii-st  knov:n  in
ITev.'  I'etherlands ,  and  v/ho  later  "becane  knov/n  as
Joris  .Tansen  Van  Mourn,  no^v  Horne,  was  of  the  old
Van  Hoorn  faiaili^  of  Holland,  or  whether  he  was
simply  -"^oris  Janzen  Van  Foorn,  which  means  th^at  he
was  -"^oris,  the  son  of  .Tan,  fro;;:  the  City  of  Voorn,
Tlolland.  Vearly  all  of  the  ininicrants  v;ho  cane  -oo
Ne-.v  "Te -Cher lands  had  nones  of  such  for:;  as  the  fol-
lowing;:
Joris  Janzen  which  means  Joris  ti'.e  son  of
Ty^iT  _„  jf.;.,  Cornelius  -.'hich  means  Joiui  the  son  of
Hornelius  --  Jan  f^ornelissen,  Tfmich  means  John  the
son  of  Cornelius,  who  Wcis  the  son  of  Cornelius;  in
such  manner  were  most  of  the  early  settlers  knovm
to   their    fellows.  This  method  of   dis tini^uishing
t?ie  children  of  the  common  people  in  Holland  had
gone  on  for  centuries,  and  it  was  only  '!fy.en  one  of
t.is  clasE  rose  above  his  surroundings  and  per-
for;ried  &  ^ne  particular  puhlic  service,  that  he
took  a,   s  ur  name  .
Thus  we  find  in  the  old  records  of  l':ew  Veth-
erlands  ,  hex:  State  and  Church,  that  the  distin-
guished ancestor  of  uhiis  Van  Home  fa^r.ily  was
known  as    Joris   Janzfcn.  It    soon   oecame   necessary
to  distin-^-uish  him  from  his  fellows  w}:o  bore
the  sajTie  naiie  but  •.■■sre  of  different  descent  .There-
fore he  havinj-  coiie  fror.  the  City  of  T:oorn  was
known  first  as  Joris  Janzen  Van  Hoorn,  afterwards
dropping  the  Janzen  from  his  name,  was  Knov;n  as
J  o  !•  i  s    Vmi  Home.
He  came  to  Hev/  Netherlands  froi.i  the  City  of
Hoorn,  Holland  in  the  ship  '■''Ero.-mfisl"  la.nding  at
?'ew  Amsterdam    (I'lew  York)    in  June   165G.

THE  VAX   HORN   FAMILY'S   HOPES^MISKD    0P

FLEMtNGTOs,    N.    J.,    Dec,    30.— "While  the
irar.j  cla'.oante  to  tbe  Hyde  poseesBione  in  England
are  still  RjiUatad  with  hopes  and  feam,  »uotli©r  setof
heivs  to  another  and  oldsr  property  have  appeared,
renewing  with  s-^^'^t  vigor  former  altemi)t8  toward
the  securiuK  of  an  Inheritance.  The  Lord  W^ldron
eRtate,  in  which  tbs  well-known  Anneke  Jans  ap-
pears consyicoonsiy,  is  one  about  which  there  has
been  mach  htifiatlou  in  past  years,  and  even  as  late
as  the  time  of  the  Tweed  Ring  it  crept  into
the  Metropolitan  courts.  It  has  been  eenerally  snp-
posed,  however,  that  active  efforts  in  that  direction
liad  been  given  up.  This  is  a  mistate.  The  Van
Horns  in  particular,  numberinK  many  "amilios
Ihrou^'houL  the  country,  are  well  organized,  and  are
preparing  to  finht  for  their  claims.  In  this  portion
of  New-Jersey  there  are  several  members  of  the
family,  and  from  some  of  these  the  foUowlng  par-
ticnlars  were  elicited:
Researches  made  inj  old  trunks  and   among   anti-
quated papers  belangini;   to  the  heirs  of  the  Van
Horns   and    Anneke  Webber,    afterward    Jans,   re-
veal   a    clear    and    lei^al    title    to     a    large    por-
tion   of    the    eronnd    on    which    New-York    City
stands.     The    original    Jansea    owned    the    Trinity
Church  estate,  as  it  is  called,  and  the  original  Vaa
Horns  some  property  in  close  proximity  to  it.     The
Van  Horns  leased  their  tract  for  99  years,  and  then
moved    into   Pennsylvania.     This  was   in  tbe    last
quarter  of  the  last  century.     HaviLg  failed   to  col-
lect their  rents,  they  gradually  lost  sicht  of  their
title,  and  would  now  be  unable   to   contest  the  claim
but  for  the   intermarriaa©   oi   their  family   with  the
Jansos.     The  united    heirs   are  tbo  ones   now  pnrsu-
ini:  the   investigation.     Besides  the   propertiee  men-
tiove^l.  ::.ese  heirs  c'aim  that  thoy  are  entitled  to  an-
other New- York  property,  known  as  the  Lord  \V  aldron
estate     part  of    which    is    also  in    Holland,       This
estate    is   valued    at    $&*2.000,000.      T.he    Trinity

w.'io  came  to  this  country  in  1649.    Wolfert  received
a  erant  of  62  acres  of  land  iroutinc:  on   the   Hudson
River    and    rnnninc   throuch   Chatham-street,    near
Chatham-square-     This  was  cranted  by   Peter  Stay-
veauut.     Bijcoming  dissatitled  with  the  t  lact,  Wolfert
ronveyed    it    to    Uis    anr.t.    Auneko   Wfbber.      She
leased'    it     to     "Gov.      Lovela<'e,      New-York's     first
Englisb  Governor,  by  whom   it   was   released  to  the
then  existinc  authorities  of  Trinity  Church.      Mean-
while, Anneke  mavried  a  man  by  the  name  of   Jans,
bv    whom   she   had   children.     After  his   death   she
niarried   a   Bojardus.  and  she   also  had   children  bv
him.     Their  descendants  are  now  contesting  for  tho
property.
Wolfert   Webber,   having   le't  a  large    estat*  m
Holland,  after  his  arrival  here   married   a   Gerirnde
Hassing.    by    whom   he   had  a    daughter  christened
Heliegoua.     The  daughter   married  .i  certain    Philip
Miothomo  in  1696.     Webber  died  in  171.%    leaviuc
a  will  in  which  he  bequeathed  liis  property  to   Helle-
Kona.  and  made  Minthorne  the  Exeeutor.     Owinc  to
the  danger  of  sea-vovHiiing  m  those  days,   the  >Ini-
thornoj*    did   not    thmk    it    would    pay  to   cross  the
ocean     ana      sekiure    the    lands    tdere.    and    Bogar-
dus    essp.yed    the    trip.       He     was,     however,      lost
on  the  way  in  a  storm,  and  the  matter  was   dropped
for  some  lime.     Minthorne's  children  were  married,
and  the  familyspread  over  the  country,  until,  at  the
present  day,  it  is  very  lar«e.     Recently  lUo    Govern-
ment   of  Holland    advertised    for    the  heirs  of   the
Webber  estate  to  p:ove  their  interests.     This  is  nuw
beins  done,  and  amiMie  the  New-Vork  families  con-
cerned  are   the    Vanfelts.    Hugaamons,     NVoolspys.

Van       Horns      are      most      concerned,       embraces
Harlem    Flats,  takio:!  in    Hell   Gate.   Central   Pnik.
find  an  unoccupied  space  of  27,800  acres.     The  V;in
Horn*  allege  that  this  land  was  conveyed   by  the
Colooial  Governor   of   New-York  to    Lord    Waldrnn
and  four  others  In  1686.     The   number    was    after-
ward  incre.i!.ed    to  2^,  the   Hd'litional    oeisoiis   cuii-
wistins  of  sons,  daughter-',  and  fons-ln-law.     The  en-
tire  property   was   willed  to   the  fifth  generation  of
i  tiu'    second  *  gii*ntees.    and   tlie     sixth    jceiu-iation
\  of    tue    first    Ktantecn.      These     eoncratirns     are
now    extant    In    the    present   Van  Horn    family.
They  <"ilcnlate  that  tao  amouut  of   property,  both  in
Holland  and  this   country,  f.n- winch   they  arestriv-
luz,  is  worth  about  $L'5O,09U.0O0.     Thov  feel  mush
more  confident  of  success  than  do  the  Hyde  heirs.
Thev    say  that    the  New-Jersey  lawyers  consulted

EOMASCE  OP  TPIE  SHORE
Tile  Story  of  the  Old  Houae  of  the  Four  Chimneys
THIS  ¥ORLD  OP  CT-IAHGE
Its  Ancient  G-lory,  Iiallo^Ysd  by  the  Genius  of
Irving,  Sv/allov/ed  up  in  a  Hew  Eirth  --
A  Marvel  of  Ingenuity.
The  "House  of  the  Pour  Chimneys"  is  doomed.
One  laore  landinark  sacrificed  to  our  iconoclastic
utilitarianism.  ITo  longer  will  lovers  of  Irving
make  pilgrimages  to  the  "Shore"  to  see  it.  Its
place  will  Icnow  it  no  more-.  The  hare  announce-
ment will  mahe  old-timers  feel  that  they  are  get-
ting old.  quite  old.  They  helong  to  the  past,
their  joys  are  shouldered  roughly  aside  "by  the
hustling  present.  One  of  the  old-tir.ers,  when  he
heard  the  news,  paid  a  visit  to  the  Shore  on  Sat-
urday to  look  once  more  on  the  old  house  and  such
things  as  h-ad  remained  from  auld  lang  syne.  Old
CommunipaWjOnce  che  loveliest  village  of  the  shore
has  suffered  many  rude  affronts  in  its  time,  since
Oloffe  Van  Kertlandt  summoned  his  lusty  follov/ers
one  sunny  spring  morning  and  left  its  hospitable
shore  to  found  the  citj^  which  has  grown  so  much
larger  than  the  mother  settlement .
Vvhat  man  is  there,  who  was  a  hoy  in  this
city  "before  Ch-arlie  Sisson  wheedled  the  shore  own-
ers and  brought  the  Central  Kailroad  with  its
malodorous  filling,  ivho  has  not  rowed  and  sailed
and  swam  and  fished  in  Communipaw  Cove?  "Who  has
not  enjoyed  visits  to  its  oyster  beds  in  the  dark
of  the  moon  and  hurried  away  with  panting  hearts
when  he   heard  the  click  of  the   rowlocks  as  the
62
V  A  B"        H  0  :R   IT  E
watchers  caiae  for  hacij  aiid  who  has  not  "treaded"
for  clams  on  the  Van  Horn  resdrYation;  or  who  has
not  sailed  up  the  creel:  paat  Mill  Creek  Johnnie's,
to  shoot  on  the  meadow,  when  Pacific  avenue  v/as
not,  and  the  Keeneys  and  Halladayd  and  Culvers  had
not -vexed  the  upland  v/ith  the  streets  and  houses
of  Lafayette?  ■  '
Dear    old  Coinmunel   lirhat   pleasures   it   afford-
ed in   the   lialcyon  days  before   Captain  Bahcock  fit-
ted us    out    in  haggy  red   trousers      and     inarched     us
away  to  the  war.
A  sharp  east  wind  ruffled  the  "bay  on  Sat-
urday, and  a  fleet  of  sirall  hoats  of  every  kind
pointed  up  the  vand,  and  "bowed  and  bohloed  in  jerky
little  curtsies  to  the  incoming  waves,  tagging  at
their  hawsers  and  painters  as  if  they  were  wforvy-
ing  because  tliey  , too  , could  not  cor.e  ashore.  Small
"boys  in  lioiae-inade  skiffs  paddled  and  sculled  in
and  out  among  the  anchored  fleet,  and  scoured  the
shore  for  flotsam  and  jetsam  afc,ainst  a  winter
scarcity    in  tne  v/oodpile.  One   laughing,      noisy
group  on  the  float  watched  a  boy  trying  to  fit  an
improvised  sprit  sail  to  the  carcass  of  a  derelict
hog.  An  extra  long  reacii,  a  treacherous  trip,  and
the  boy  was  floundering  in  the  water,  clothes  and
all.  A  burst  of  laughter,  a  dead  porker  floating
away  trailing  the  sprit  sail  on  its  beam  ends,,  two
mischievous  urchins  fleeing  from  the  wrath  to -come
and  a  lusty  kicking  in  the  water  were  simultaneous
events.  The  buy  cane  out  mad  as  a  hornet , dripping
from  every  pendant  garment)  but  right  end  up.  He
was  ajuphibious ,  as  all  boys  ought  to  be,  who  are
brought   up   on   the    shore.
Black  Tom,  once  a  scarcely  visible  rock.
vrhere  tradition  says  a  colored  man  named  Tom  v/as
drowned, has  grovm  into  a  large  island;  with  grassy
lawns, tall  v/arehouses  and  lines  of  railroads ,  quite
shutting  off  the  viev/  of  the  lower  bay  from  the
Shore .
The  big   statue   on     Gibbet  Island     seems   to

V  A  if        H   0   R  IT  E
brins  it  nearer  to  tiie  sliore  ,  and  the  electric
light  ioas  suai'ed.  away  the  ghost,-:  of  Yanderscaup' s
companions,  who  ones  v/ere  visihJ.e  to  the  eyes  of
faith,  rattling  their  ghosLly  chains  ua  phantom;
gihhets.  Kven  ''Die  Wild  Gaus"  tavarn  .  v.'here  Van-
derscanp  lived  and  died.  has  i~one  the^a  nany  gen-
erations, leaving  no  tradition  ox  a  site  net  even
in  KJnicker  Docker .  Of  all  the  historic  structures
only  the  "House  of  the  I"our  Chimneys"  remains  .well
preserved  froi.i  xhe  teeth  of  time  and  apparently
good  for  centuries  yet  unborn.  The  -reen  lawn  is
as  fresh  as  if  each  fclade  of  grass  had  a  contract
to  prove  tliat  tiie  life  had  not  yet  gone  out  of  the
old  place.  There  is  the  old  stone  house  with  its
solid  single  stor;^  and  hipped  roof,  and  the  later
growths  of  thick -walled  kitchen  and  south  expan-
sion which  developed  as  the  wants  of  the  fa.mily
increased.  ITo  one  thiiiks  of  prosaic  hrick-laA'^ers
and  plasterers      in   looking  a,t    the   old  place.  It
seems  nore  natural  to  inagine  th^t  it  /-^rew  hy  some
process  of  accretion,  Svery  detail  about  the  old
place  sesned  to  he  just  right  to  fill  out  the  pic-
ture enshrined  in  the  memorj'-  of  long  ago.  except
the  kitchen  door.  Over  that  door  once  sacred  to
a,ppetizin2  smells,  a  snail  sign  Dore  this  inscrip-

Half  a  centur-y  had  joined  the  silent  ma-
jority since  Martin  Van  Euren  piloted  Washington
Irving  to  this  old  house,  and  through  these  saure
doors  he  was  welcomed  "by  a  Van  Horn,,  It  was  John

■faer  of  the  family  feel  no  sense  of  impudence  in
speaking;  of  "Mill  Creeic  Johnnie",  or  "Johnnie  of
the  shore."  The  places  where  they  lived  are  land-
marks to  laeasure  hy,  and  even  now,  when  stranger
thousands  iiave  "become  domiciled  on  the  ground  once
tilled  by  dead  and  gone  Van  Horns,  no  one  thinks
of  John  Van  Horn,  Cornelius  Van  Horn  or  Garret  Van  -j^
Horn  as  tlie  heads  of  the  generation.  They  are  in-
stantly identified,  iiientally,  as  Jolmnie,  Garry  or
Cornell,  by  nany  v/ho  could  not  recognize  them  if
they  were  present.  Any  old  timer  will  describe  a
place  as  so  far  from  Johnnie  Van  Horn's,  or  Mill  K
Creek  Johnnie' s , because  for  generations  these  have
been  fixed  institutions  in  this  v/orld  of  cliange,
and   now  these   too  are  goine.
Excavations  for  street  grading  through  the
old  farm  are  laying  bare  the  hiotory  of  the  upland
from  the  time  the  glaciers  melted  and  deposited
the  gravel  and  boulders  of  the  morain.  The  wood-
ed hill  is  gone,  the  farm  is  going, and  now  the  old
house   is   going.  Its   days   are   numbered,    and  when
the   spring  time   comas  again     noticing  will  remain
to   prove   its   existence   except   tradition, and  photo-
graphs v/hich  the  new  owners  have   ordered*  It   is
some   consolation  for  having  it    torn   dovm   that    none
but   Van  Horns  will   ever  have   lived  in  it.
The  parent  stem  of  the  family  lived  in
Koorn,  a  seaport  on  the  Zuyder  Zee,  twenty  miles
north  of  Amsterdam,  and  the  branch  that  climbed
over  the  wall  and  founded  the  family  here  was  John
Van  Horn.  He  is  first  recorded  by  a  power  of  at-
torney which  shov.'ed  him  t  o  be  a  minor,  and  he  want-
ed to  draw  on  his  estate  at  home  in  June,  1645.  A
son  of  that  John,  baptized  Joris,  married  Maria
Rutgers  on  March  11,  1666.  His  son,  known  in  his-
tory as  "Rutt"  Van  Horn, being  named  Rutgers,  after
iiis  mother,  married  a  Vreeland,  and  his  vvlfe's  un-
cle, Knoch  Vreeland,  gave  liiin  the  original  farm  on
the  siuore  by  deed  dated  May  7,  1711,  the  consider-
ation being   "one  pepper  corn   if   demanded."  As   long

in  the  cocununity  and  their  o^rfners  v/ere  laiov/n  "by
their   abbreviations  all   over    the  country  side.
The  present  house  was  huilt  in  1304,  as  is
shown  by  the  quaint  iron  figure  in  the  front  wall
and  it  occupies  the  site  of  the  older  structure  to
v,'hich  "Rutftook  his  bride  one  suiaiaer  day  one  hun-
dred and  seventy-seven  years  ago.
Irving  tells  iiov/  when  the  new  house  was
built,  the  treasures  of  the  old  one  were  trans-
ferred to  the  neviT  quarters,  among  them  the  big  hat
of  "Walter  the  Doubter"  ,  and  the  alioe  fsLfh  which.
"Peter  the  Headstrong"  once  dispersed  his  council,
and  how  they  were  tlirovm  out  by  ca.reless  descend-
ants v;ho  knew  not  their  n;/stic  povv'er,  and  how  a
nonster  cabbage  grew  in  the  hat  -.vhiGh  came  to  be
kiiown  as  the  "Governor's  head",  and  produced  the
seed  from  which  all  the  cabbages  were  raised
around  Communipaw,  bringing  much  wealth  to  the  de-
scendants of  the  old  settlers  v/hori  Peter  loved, and
how  Peter  Stu^^vesant '  s  shoe  sank  in  the  bay,  -and
how  the  03''3ters  clustered  arou.nd  it  and  formed  the
famous  bed  which  produced  the  big  oysters  known  aa
the    "Governor's   foot".  Irving  is   authority      for
many  curious  legends  about  the  "House  of  the  Four
Chimne>-s"  and  v;hat  it  contained.  Ke  was  taken  in-
to the  great  garret  by  John  Van  Horn  and  saw  the
colonial  records  of  that  storehouse  of  tradition,
whence  streams  of  light  were  thrown  down  the  dark
places    of  tine.  After  he   left   the   old  house     he
wrote:  "I'lay  the  House  of  the  Pour  Chimneys  remain
for  ages  tlie  citadel  of  Communipaw,  and  the  smoke
of  its  chimneys  continue  to  ascend-  a  sweet  smell-
iiig   incense   in   the   nose   of   St.   Hicholas."

To  the  Editor   of  the  Knicicerloocker
Sir--  I  o"bserve,  w?,th.  pleasure,  that  you  are
perforning  from  tiir.e  to  time  a  pious -duty,  imposed
upon  you,  I  may  say,  hy  the  nasae  you  have-  adopted
as  3'-our  titular  standard, in  following  in  the  foot-
steps of  the 'venerahle  Knickerbocker,  and  gleaning
every  fact  concernir^::  the  early  times  of  the  Man-
hattoes  which  may  have  escaped  his  hand.  I  trust,
therefore,  a  fev/  particulars,  legendary  and  sta-
tist ical, concerning  a  place  -^hich  figures  conspic-
uously in  the  early  pages  of  his  history,  will  not
be   unacceptable,  I  allude,    sir,    to   th.e     ancient
and  renowned  village  of  Coinmunipaw,  which,  accord-
ing to  the  veracious  ]jiedrich,and  to  equally  vera-
cious tradition , was  the  first  spot  v7here  our  ever-
tc-he-lainented  Dutch  progeniuors  planted  their
standard  and  cast  the  seeds  of  engsire,  and  from
whence  stibsequently  sailed  the  laemorable  expedi-
tion uxider  Oloffe  the  Dreaiaer,  which  landed  on  the
opposite  i Gland  of  I-Ianna-hata ,  and  founded  the
present  city  of  llew  York,  the  cixy  of  cu^eams  and
speculations .
Gommunipaw,  therefore,  may  truly  be  called
the  parent  of  ITew  York;  yet  it  is  an  astonishing
fact  that  though  immediately  opposite  to  the  great
city  it  has  produced, from  vfnence  its  red  roofs  and
tin  Y/eather-cocks  can  actually  be  descried  peering
above  the  surrounding  apple  orchards,  it  should  be
almost  as  rarely  visited  and  as  little  knovm  \>j
the  .nlTabitants  of  the  rrietropolis  as  if  it  had
been  locked  up  among  the  Rocky  Mountain:^  =  Sir,  I
think  there  is  something  unnatural  in  this,  es-
peciallj''  m  these  times  of  ramble  and  research,
when  our  citizens  are  anti qui ty -hunt ing  in  every
part  of  the  world.  Curiosity,  like  charity  , should

burghers,  especially  those  of  the  real  Knicker-
bocker breed,  before  they  send  their  sons  abroad
to  wonder  and  grow  wise  among  the  remains  of
Greece  and  Rone, to  let  thorn  make  a  tour  of  ancient
Pavonia,  from  ¥©ehav7k  even  to  the  Kills,  and  medi-
tate, with  filial  reverence, on  the  aoss-grown  man-
sions  of  Coainunipaw.
Sir,  I  regard  this  nuch-neclected  village
as  one  of  the  most  remarkable  places  in  the  coun-
tr3".  The  intelligent  traveler,  as  he  looks  dovm
upon  it  from  the  Bergen  Heights,  modestly  nestled
among  its  ca)3bage -gardens,  while  the  great  flaunt-
ing city  it  lias  begotten  is  stretching  far  and
wide  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  bay,  the  intelli-
gent traveler,  I  say,  vvill  be  filled  v/ith  aston-
isliment;  not,  sir,  at  tlie  villt.ge  of  Communipaw,
VTMch  in  truth  is  a  ver;/  small  village,  but  at  the
almost  incredible  fact  that  so  small  a  village
should     h^ve   produced   so  great   a  city.  It   looks
to  him,    indeed,   like    some   squat  little   dame,      with
a  tall  grenadier   of  a   eon     strutting  by  her      side;
or   some    simple-hearted  hen      tliat      has      unv/ittingly
hatched  out  a   long-legged  turkey ,
But  trJ.3  is  not  all  for  ?»hich  Communipaw
is  remarkable.  Sir,  it  in  interesting  on  another
account.  It  is  to  the  ancient  province  of  the  Hew
iTetherlands  and  the  classic  era  of  the  Dutch  dy-
nasty v/hat  Kerculaneum  and  Pompeii  are  to  ancient
RoLie     and  the   glorious   days    of    the   empire.  Here
everything  remains  in  statu  quo,  as  it  was  in  the
days  of  Oloffe  the  Dreamer,  Salter  the  Doubter, and
the  other  wortloies  of  the  golden  age;  the  same
broad-brinned  liats  and  broad-bottomed  breeches;
the  same  knee-buckles  and  shoe-buckles;  the  same
close-quilled  caps  and  linsey-woolsey  tshort  gowns
and  petticoats;  the  same  implements  and  utensils
and  forms  and  fashions;  in  a  word,  CoLimunipaw  at
the  present  day  is  a  picture  of  wliat  Fev/  Amster-
dam \7as  before  the  conquest.  The  "intellip^ent

ones  for  the  grovm-up  memhers  of  the  family,  and
little  ones  for  the  little  folk.  Instead  of  cold
jnarhle  porches,  Vvdth  close-locked  doors  and  brass

wortliy  burgher  snoking  his  pipe  on  -che  old-fash-

Y/>:iat  cmriaed  spell  h^s  kept  tlois  v;onderful  little

been  buried  under  its  cabbage -gardens ,  and  only
dug  out  in  modern  days  for  the  v;onder  and  edifica-
tion of  the  world?  The  reply  involves  a  point  of
history  vcorthy  of  notice  and  record,  and  reflect-
ing isiijiortal  honor  on  Cor^inunipaw,
At  tioe  time  when  ifew  Aiasterdan  '.vas  invaded
and  conquered  bj-  British  foes,  as  laas  been  related
in  the  history'  of  the  venerable  Diedrich,  a  great
disijersion  took  place  among  the  Dutch  inhabitants.
Many,  like  the  illustrious  Peter  Stuyvesant,  bur-
ied themselves  in  rural  retreats  in  the  Bov/erie;
others,  like  Wolfert  Acker,  took  refuge  in  various
remote  parts  of  the  Hudson;  but  there  was  cne
staunch,  unconquerable  band  that  determined  to
keep  together  and  preserve  themselves,  like  seed
corn,  for  the  future  fructification  and  perpetuity
of  the  Knickerbocker  race.    These  were  headed  by
69
.  V  A  H   H  0  R  N  E
one  Garret  Van  Horne ^  a  gigantic  Dutchman,  the
Pelayo  of  the  Hev/  iletherlanda ,  Under  his  guid-
ance, they  retreated  across  the  tay  and  huried
themselves  anong  the  marshes  of  ancient  Pavonia,as
did  the  followers  of  Pelayo  ajtnong  the  mountains  of
Asturias,  'Hh^a  Spain  was  overrun  by  its  Arabian
invaders ,
The  gallant  Van  Home  set  up  his  standard
at  Coinniunipaw,and  invited  all  those  to  rally  under
it  who  v-'ei'o  true  lleder landers  at  heart,  and  deter-
mined to  resist  all  foreign  intermixture  or  en-
croachment. A  strict  non-intercourse  was  observed
with  the  captured  city;  not  a  boat  ever  crossed  to
it  from  Coinmunipav/,  and  the  English  language  was
rigorously  tcibooed  throughout  the  village  and  its
dependencies.  Every  mo,n  v/as  sworn  to  wear  his  hat,
cut  his  coat,  build  his  house,  and  harness  his
horses,  exactly  as  his  father  had  done  before  him^
and  to  permit  nothing  but  the  Dutch  language  to  be
spolcen  in  his  household.
As  a  citadel  of  the  place  and  a  stronghold
for  the  preservation  and  defense  of  everythiiig
Dutch,  the  gallant  Van  Home  erected  a  lordly  man-
sion,with  a  chimney  perched  at  every  corner,  which
thence  derived  the  aristocrat ical  name  of  "The
House  of  the  Four  Chimneys."  hither  he  trans-
ferred meMy  of  the  precious  relics  of  ITew  Amster-
dam; the  great  round-crowned  hat  tha,t  once  cover-
ed the  capacious  head  of  Walter  the  Doubter,  and
the  identical  shoe  with  which  Peter  the  Headstrong-
kicked  his  pusillanimous  councilors  dov/nstairs.  St.
Nicholas,  it  is  said,  took  this  loyal  house  under
his  especial  protection;  and  a  Dutcii  soothsayer
predicted,  that  as  long  as  it  should  stand  Gommun-
ipav7  would  be  safe  from  the  intrusion  either  of
Eriton  or  Yankee.
In  this  house  v/ould  the  gallant  Van  Home
and  his  compeers  hold  frequent  councils  of  war  as
to  the  possibility  of  re-conquering  the  province
from  the  British;  and  here  would  they  sit  for
hours,  nay,  d^ye,  together  smoking  tlieir  pipea  and
538161
70
V  A  ]^   H  0  R  1\T  E
keeping  watch  upon  the  growing  city  of  Hew  York;
groaning  in  spirit  whenever  they  saw  a  new  houss
erected  or  ship  launched ^amd  persuading  themselves
that  Admiral  Van  Tr  onp  would  one  day  or  other  ar~
rive  to  sweep  out  the  invaders  with  the  'broom
which  he  carried  at  his  masthead.
Years  rolled  by,  but  Van  Tromp  never  ar-
rived. The  British  strengthened  tliemselves  in  the
land,  and  the  captured  city  flourished  under  their
domination.  Still  the  worthies  of  Conmunipaw  v/ould
not  despair;  something  or  other,  they  were  sure,
would  turn  up  to  restore  the  power  of  the  Hogen
Mo^^ens,  the  Lords  States-General;  so  they  kept
smoking  and  smoking,  and  watching  and  watching,
and  turning  tlTe  same -few  thoughts  over  and  over  ia
a  perpetual  circle, which  is  commonly  called  delib-
erating ,  In  the  meantime,  being  hemmed  up  within
a  narrow  compass,  hotween  the  broad  bay  and  the
Bergen  Hills,  they  grew  poorer  and  poorer,  until
they  liad  scarce  the  wherewitlial  to  maintain  their
pipes  in  fuel  during  their  endless   deliberations.
And  now  must  I  relate  a  circumstance  which
will  call  for  a  little  exertion  of  faith  on  the
part  of  the  reader;  but  I  can  only  say  that  if  he
doubts  it  he  had  better  not  utter  his  doubts  in
COEimunipaw,  as  it  is  among  the  religious  beliefs
of  the  place.  It  is,  in  fact,  nothing  more  nor
less  than  a  miracle,  worked  by  the  blessed  St.
Nicholas  for  the  relief  and  sustenance  of  this
loyal  community.
It  so  happened,  in  this  time  of  extremity,
that  in  t}:ie  course  of  cleaning  the  House  of  the
Four  Chimneys,  by  an  ignorant  housewife  who  knew
nothing  of  the  historic  value  of  the  relics  it
contained,  the  old  hat  of  Walter  the  Doubter  and
the  executive  shoe  of  Peter  the  Headstrong  were
thrown  out  of  doors  aa  rubbish.  But  mark  the
consequences.  The  good  St.  Nicholas  kept  Wotch.
over  these  precious  relics, and  wrought  out  of  them
a  wonderful  providence.
The  hat  of  Walter  the  Doubter  falling  on
71
YAM        HORNE
a  stercoraceous  heap  of  compost,  in  the  rear  of
the  house,  began  forthwith  to  vegetate.  Its  broad
brim  spread  forth  grandly  and  exfoliated,  and  its
round  crown  swelled  and  crimped  and  consolidated
until  the  whole  became  a  prodigious  cabbage, riTal-
ing  in  magnitude  tlie  capacious  head  of  the  Boubter.
In  a  word,  it  was  the  origin  of  that  renowned  spe-
cies of  cabbage  known^  by  all  Dutch  epicures,  by
the  naia©  of  the  Governor's  Head,  and  which  is  to
tliia   day  the  glory   of  Communipaw,
On  the  other  hand,  the  shoe  of  Peter  Stuy-
veaauit, being  tiirown  into  the  rtver  in  front  of  the
house,  gradually  hardened  and  concreted,  and  be-
came covered  with  barnacles,  and  at  lengfch  ti;rned
into  a  gigantic  oyster;  being  the  progenitor  of
that  illustrious  species  known  throughout  the  gas-
tronomical  world  by  the  name  of  the  Governor's
Foot,
These  miracles  v/ere  the  salvation  of  Com-
munipavr.  The   sages   of   the  place   immediatsly   ti^.w
in  them  the  hand  of  St.  Nicholas  and  understood
their  mystic  signification.  They  set  to  work  with
all  diligence  to  ciiltivate  and  multiply  these
great,  blessings;  and  so  abundantly  did  the  guber-
natorial hat  and  shoe  fructify  and  increase,  that
in  a  little  time  great  patches  of  cabbages  were  to
be  seen  extending  from  the  village  of  Communipaw
quite  to  the  Bergen  Hills;  while  tlie  whole  bottom
of  the  bay  in  front  became  a  vast  bed  of  oysterso
Ever  since  that  time  this  excellent  community  has
been  divided  into  two  great  classes;  those  who
cultivate  the  land  and  those  who  cultivate  the
water.  The  former  have  devoted  themselves  to  the
nurture  and  edification  of  cabbages,  rearing  them
in  all  their  varieties , while  the  latter  have  form-
ed parks  and  plantations,  under  water,  to  v/hich
juvenile  oystsrs  are  transplanted  from  foreign
parts   to  finish  their   education.
As  these  great  sources  of  profit  multi-
plied upon  their  hands,      the  worthy  inhabitants   of

Ccmnunipaw  Tosgan  to  lon2  for  a  market  at  which  to
dispose  of  tiieir  sup srabv.n dance,  This  gradually
produced  once  mory  an  intercourse  irith  ITew  York;
"but  it  was  alv/ays  carried  en  "by  t}-©  old  people  and
the  negroes;  never  would  tlie3r  permit  the  5'"oung
folks  of  either  sex  to  visit  the  city,,  lost  they
should  get  tainted  with  foreign  Lianners  and  hring
home  foreign  fashions o  Even  to  this  day,  if  you
see  an  old  burghex'  in  the  market, with  hat  and  garb
of  antique  Dutch  fashion, you  may  be  sure  he  is  one
of  the  old  unconquered  race  of  the  "bitter  blood'',
who  maintain  their  stronghold  at  Communlpaw.
In  modern  days,  the  hereditary  bitterness
against  the  English  has  lost  much  of  its  asperity,
or  rather  has  become  merged  in  a  now  source  of
jealousy  and  apprehension;  I  allude  to  the  inces-
sant and  widesproading  irruptions  from  Hew  England,
Word  has  been  continually  brought  back  to  Comrauni-
paw,  by  those  ^JC  the  conmuni'cy  who  return  from
their  trading  voyHges  in  cabbages  and  oysters,  of
tlie  alarming  jjov^er  which  the  Yankees  are  gaining
in  the  ancient  city  of  New  Misterdam;  elbowing  the
genuine  ICniokerbockera  out  of  all  civic  poats  of
honor  anci  profit;  bargaining  them  out  of  their
hereditary  homesteads;  pviliing  dovm  the  venerable
houses,  with  crow-step  gables,  which  have  stood
since  the  time  of  the  Dutch  rule,  and  erecting,
instead,  granite  stores  and  marble  banks;  in  a
word,  ovincing  a  deadly  determination  to  obliter-
ate every  vestige  of  the  good  old  Dutch  times.
In  consequence  of  the  jealousy  thus  awak-
ened, the  worthy  traders  from  Communipav/  confine
their  dealings,  as  much  as  possible,  to  the  genu-
ine Dutch  families.  If  they  furnish  the  Yankees
at  all,  it  is  with  inferior  articles.  Ilever  can
the  latter  procure  a  real  "Governor's  Head,"  or
"Governor's  Foot,"  though  they  have  offered  ex-
travagant prices  for  the  same,  to  grace  their  ta-
ble on  the  annual  festival  of  the  New  England  So-
ciety,

But  what  has  carried  this  hostility  to  the
Yankees  to  the  highest  pitch,  was  an  attempt  made
by  that  all -pervading  race  to  get  possession  of
Cooiiiunipav?  itself »  Yes,  sir;  during  the  late
mania  for  land  speculation  a  daring  company  of
Yankee  projectors  landed  before  the  village;  stop-
ped the  honest  burghers  on  the  public  liighway  and
endeavored  to  bargain  them  out  of  their  hereditary
acres;  displayed  lithographic  maps,  in  which  their
cabbage -gardens  were  laid  out  into  town  lots; their
oyster  parks  into  docks  and  quays;  and  even  the
House  of  the  Pour  Chimneys  metamorphosed  into  a
bank,  which  was-  to  enrich  the  whole  neighborhood
with  paper  money,
Fortunately  the  gallant  Van  Hornes  came  to
the  rescue,  just  as  some  of  the  worthy  burghers
were  on  the  point  of  capitulating.  The  Yaxitcees
v/ere  put  to  the  rout,  with  signal  confusion,  and
have  never  since  dared  to  show  their  faces  in  the
place.  The  good  people  continue  to  cultivate  their
cabbages  and  rear  their  oysters;  they  know  nothing
of  banks,  nor  joint-stock  companies,  but  treasure
up  their  money  in  stocking-feet,  at  the  bottom  of
the  family  chest,  or  bury  it  in  iron  pots,'  as  did
their  fathers  and  grandfathers  before  them.
As  to  the  House  of  the  Four  Chimneys,  it
still  remains  in  the  great  and  tall  family  of-  the
Van  Hornes.  Here  are  to  be  seen  ancient  Dutch
corner  cupboards,  chests  of  drawers,  and  massive
clothes-presses,  quaintly  carved,  and  carefully
v/axed  and  polished;  together  vath  divers  thick,
black-letter  volumes,  with  brass  clasps,  printed
of  yore  in  Leyden  and  Amsterdam,  and  handed  down
from  generation  to  generation  in  the  family,  but
never  read.  They  are  preserved  in  the  archives,
among  sundry  old  parcliment  deeds,  in  Dutch  and
English,  bearing  the  seals  of  the  early  governors
of  the  province.
In  this  house  the  primitive  Dutch  holidays
of  Paas  and  Pinxter  are  faithfully  kept  up;   and

Nicholas  forgotten,  when  all  the  childrsn  are
sure  to  hang  up  their  stocicings,  and  to  have  tiiem
filled  according  to  their  deserts;  though,  it  is
said,  the  tjood  saint  is  occasionally  perplexed
in  his  nocturnal  visits  which  chimney  to  de-
scend.
Of  late,  this  portentous  mansion  has  begun
to  give  signs  of  dilapidation  and  decay c  Soae
have  attributed  this  to  the  visits  made  by  the
young  people  to  the  city, and  their  bringing  thence
various  modern  fashions;  and  to  their  neglect  of
the  Dutch  language,  which  is  gradually  becoming
confined  to  the  older  persons  in  the  community.
The  house,  too.  was  greatly  shaken  by  high  winds,
during  the  prevalence  of  the  specular- ion  mania,
especially  at  the  time  of  the  landing  of  the
Yankees.  Seeing  how  mysteriously  the  fate  of  Com-
munipaw  is  identified  with  this  venerab3-e  mansion,
we  cannot  wonder  that  the  older  and  wiser  heads  of
the  community  should  be  filled  with  dismay,  when-
ever a  brick  is  toppled  dovm  from  one  of  the  chim-
neys ,  or  a  weather-cock  is  blown  off  from  a  gable
end.
The  present  lord  of  this  historic  pile,  I
am  happy  to  say,  is  calculated  xo  maintain  it  in
all  its  integrity.  He  is  of  patriarchal  age,  and
is  worthy  of  the  days  of  the  patriarch?.  He  has
done  his  utmost  to  increase  and  multiply  the  true
race  in  the  land.  His  wife  has  not  been  inferior
to  him  in  seal,  and  thoy  are  surrounded  by  a  good-
ly progeny  of  children,  and  grandchildren,  and
great -gandchildren,  who -promise  to  perpetuate  the
name  of  Van  Home  until  time  shall  be  no  more.  So
be  it'.  Long  may  the  horn  of  the  Van  Homes  con-
tinue to  be  exalted  in  the  land  I  Tall  as  they  are,
may  their  shadows  never  be  less'.  May  the  House
of  the  Pour  Chimneys  remain  for  ages  the  citadel
of  Gommunipaw,   and  the  smoke  of  its  chimneys  con-
