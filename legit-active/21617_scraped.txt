BOB MARLEYOne Drop Lyrics
Feel it in the one drop
Well, I still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
The generation gap
So feel this drumbeat
As it beats within playing a rhythm
Resisting against the system
Ooh-we I know Jah would never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
I know Jah would never let us down
Oh no! Oh no!
They made their world so hard
Every day we got to keep on fighting
They made their world so hard
Every day the people are dying
It dread, dread for hunger and
starvation dread dread, dread on dread
Lamentation dread dread
But read it in Revelation dread dread
You'll find your redemption
And then you
Give us the teachings of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
A you fe give us the teaching of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
Feel it in the one drop
And we still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
And we filling the gap
So feel this drubeat
As it beats within playing a rhythm
Fighting against ism and skism
Singing I know Jah would never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
I know Jah would never let us down
Oh no! Oh no!
They made their world so hard
Every day we got to keep on fighting
They made their world so hard
Every day the people are dying
It dread, it dread, it dread
Dread dread, what can I say, it dread
It dread on dread, dread, dread
It dread, it dread dread
Give us the teachings of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
Can you hear
Give us the teachings of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
We feel it in the one drop
For we still got the time to rap
And we're making the one stop
Let me tell you this generation gap
So feel this drumbeat
I tell you what, it's beating within
Feel you heart playing a rhythm
And you know it's resisting against ism and skism
Singing I know Jah would never let us down
