Having met Mark and been impressed by the work carried out on my wife's cataracts I called him to discuss my lower eyelid problem. He was very reassuring explaining how he would carry out the work, the time it would take and when he could do it.  He was brilliant !! Phoned him on Wednesday, he did it on Saturday! Far better than the first op, no pain, so easy, and far less expensive.
If you have an eye problem I would recommend him to you. Thanks again, Mark.
