I have fond memories of Mike as a teammate on the Milwaukee Kickers back in the 70's, and also as a neighbor from the Beloit Road/95th Street/96th Street stomping grounds, part of the many sports activities in our back lot and around the St. Matthias neighborhood that involved the Riegerts, the Dilletts, the Fehrenbachs, and so many others.I saw Mike for the first time in thirty years in late 2008 at my father's funeral.  Seeing him and many of the Riegerts at that time brought back all of those fond memories, and reinforced the importance of family and friends and roots. Reading the many testimonials to Mike's life, it is clear that you and Mike have espoused those family values throughout your life together.I am proud to have known Mike, and I am truly sorry for your loss.  All of the extended Fehrenbach family sends their sympathy.December 30, 2009I knew Mike and Linda in the 70's,thru the Riegert family. I just want to say that your family has so many memories that will always keep him in your hearts forever. You are in my prayers. Lynda KobsJackie DreyerDecember 30, 2009It was a pleasure for myself as well to attend the funeral service for Mr. Dillet on Tuesday morning.  I was inspired by not only the turnout of so many people who obviously loved (and continue to love) him and the family very much, but also at the words of the eulogy that was given.  He was even far greater of a person than many of us knew, and I can only hope that in my lifetime I touch half as many people as he did.  You are a beautiful and strong family; never forget that.Bud BrauerDecember 30, 2009To the Dillett Family.......I had the extreme pleasure to meet Mike in the course of my position at St. Roman Parish. He offered his time in diagnosing a heating problem in our Parish office. During several conversations his faith and committment to God, family, and business were most evident.Please accept my heartfelt sympathy.Gene EberhardyDecember 30, 2009Some people are put on the earth to make it a much better place. Mike was one of these people. He was class both on and off the soccer field. I have been truly blessed to have known Mike. My deepest sympathies to the Dillett family.Genna GiordanoDecember 29, 2009Dillett Family- After attending the wake and service this week I believe that actions speak a thousand words. The turnout of people at both was amazing and it truly showed how big of an impact Dr. Dillett had on the community. Such a great man, taken from us too soon. I hope you can take comfort in knowing that Mr. Dillett has done so much more in his shortcut lifetime than many do in a full lifetime. Please, never hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do for you. "...The goal isn't to last forever, it's to create something that will." No quote is more fitting for him.The McGavock'sDecember 29, 2009Our deepest sympathies go out to you and your family during this difficult time. We will keep Mike and your family in our thoughts and prayers. God Bless You.The Kisley'sDecember 29, 2009It has been a true honor and privilege knowing you for several years and we send our sympathies to Linda and the rest of the Dilletts. He was a great man and will never be forgotten. Our condolences.Joseph LaChapelleDecember 28, 2009My deepest sympathies on the loss of Mike. I had heard alot about him from my brother Jim, who works at Dillett Mechanical. I had never met him until my wife Janet passed away back in June. Mike took the time to attend Janet's funeral service even though he had never met Janet and me. Truly a very thoughtful and wonderful man. My thoughts and prayers are with the Dillett family.  May God bless and comfort you.December 28, 2009Our prayers and thoughts are with you and your family during this most difficult time.The Consentino's (friends of Jolie and Kyle)Heat & Power Products, Inc.December 28, 2009We have enjoyed working with Michael over the years.

Our condolences to his family and many friends.Wesley WildDecember 28, 2009Dear Charlie and family,I am sorry to hear about Mike,I was honered to have met such a wonderful man. My condolences.Mark BalzerDecember 27, 2009To Linda, Family, and Extended Family,I was shocked and saddened to hear of Mike's passing. Mike gave to me in business and privilege, but I never had the chance to return a heartfelt favor. I guess I thought I would have an opportunity at some point in the near future. He spoke to me with a smile, no matter how busy, and that is how I will remember him. God bless to all who have lost this wonderful man.Mark Balzer and Family.Ronda DeAngelisDecember 27, 2009Dear Linda and Family,Our heartfelt prayers of love and comfort are sent your way.

May God help you heal and find peace knowing that he is now in heaven with our Lord.  We have all been blessed to have known him and have him in our lives.Michele MalanDecember 26, 2009Dearest Linda, Barb, Charlie, Jolie, and the rest of the Dillett family,    My very deepest sympathy to you for your great and unexpected loss. There is a new Angel in heaven and it is apparent that God takes the good much too soon for our desires. It really does seem that way, and from what I have heard, he was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, coach and boss. What a positive impact he has made, and it is obvious to me that God needed/needs him too! His life hasn't ended, but has been altered and he is looking down upon you as a guardian angel to all that he has loved. Keep strong as a family and keep your faith (which the Dillett family will I know) and you will get through this together! Michele Malan (Princeton Club)Thomas KothDecember 24, 2009The Dillett familyPlease accept my sincere condolences in the passing of your beloved husband and father. Mike was my work-mate at Johnson Control for many years. His work ethics, honesty, human kindness and strong Faith was utmost in his life. He was a true friend and a pleasure to have known...He will be missed by all.Tom & Bettyanne KothJan SalyersDecember 24, 2009Tom and Jim,I'm so sorry to hear about your Dad.Mali and I will remember you and yours in our prayers.Your downstairs neighbors from 3605Nancy GroenDecember 24, 2009Dear Mary and family,  My condolences to you and your family,I never got to meet the boys Grandpa.  He was probably a wonderful man and I know he was a good teacher because you too are a wonderful person to know. May God Bless.  Nancy Groen - Nancy Cares Day Care - Eagle, WisconsinDecember 23, 2009Dear Linda and family,My deepest sympathies go out you.  I count myself honored and blessed to have had the opportunity to know Mike.     It was a privilege and a joy to coach one of his fine sons, Peter, at UW-Oshkosh. God bless you and keep you,R. Toby BaresDecember 23, 2009Our family had the honor and pleasure to meet Mike, Linda and all of the Dillett family through our son Paul Wagner. Our Paul joyously married Mike's beautiful daughter Teresa this past July 10th 2009.  My husband and I had to move to St Louis from West Allis in Sept 2004 due to employment.  Leaving Paul in West Allis was one of the hardest things we ever had to do as parents.  But we found great comfort in the fact that Paul met Teresa, fell in love and married into such a wonderful family.  The Dilletts have welcomed and accepted our Paul as one of their own.  We feel very blessed that our son has been welcomed into this amazing family.  They are all a testimony to how they were raised by their wonderful parents.  Mike was a wonderful, reverent, zealous and kind man.  We consider it an honor to have known him, even if for only a brief time. We know that he is in Heaven with the angels right now.  God bless.  The Wagners O'Fallon, MO formally of West Allis WI.Chris LoganDecember 23, 2009Dillett Family,I'll always remember Mike for his love for family and a stellar competitor on the soccer field.

We will be thinking of and praying for you and your family.Joe & Sandy BaumDecember 23, 2009The Stroud girls were better Soccer players because of Mr Dillett, he let them shine, and he made them mind. Those kind of coaches are so rare. Stacy went on to play college Soccer & also coach, she may not have done that if not for the confidence she had by playing for him, he challanged her. He made a difference in so many of those young soccer kids lives. He is a special angel in heaven.Jack ZemlickaDecember 23, 2009I had the pleasure of knowing Mike through my work as a sportswriter for several years. Wonderful personality and always with a smile on the soccer field.

May you find comfort and strength in the memories you shared. During this difficult time our thoughts and prayers go out to you and your entire family.Jamie, Dale, Nick and Mitch EwigDecember 23, 2009Dear Linda & Family:I wanted to write to let you know what an inspiration Mike was to all the kids he coached over the years.  I know Nick really had much respect and admiration for him as a coach and as a friend and father to his good friend Charlie.  Watching how the two of you took such interest in all your childrens lives was an inspiration and really showed what a close family you are.  We will keep you in our prayers.Sincerely,   The Ewig FamilyJulie BishopDecember 23, 2009Mike was a wonderful man and he'll be missed by all of his friends in The Unified Group.  We'll always remember his positive nature, his infectious laugh, and all of the contributions he made to our group and to the industry.  He was a true gentleman!  Julie Bishop and the entire Unified Group teamFr. Marv KnightonDecember 23, 2009Dear Linda & family:Words cannot fully express the sorow I hold for you with the passing of Michael. I was fortunate to have met Michael some forty years ago. I met the Dillet family via the Riegert family who were neighbors. Michael always struck me as a kind and gracious person endowed with a deep faith. His love for you Linda and the family was true testimony of who he was. He accepted his medical situation in faith and those who visited were moved by that faith. It is during this Christmas season we appreciate not only the birth of Jesus but value his life, his suffering, death and resurrection. Amid your pain may your faith strengthen you to believe that Micahel's "life is simply changed not ended." Please know I hold you, the family and friends in prayer. God is with you!In the Risen Christ,(Fr) Marv KnightonDecember 23, 2009I will never forget meeting Linda and Mike for the first time. We were on a Unified Group cruise for the annual meeting. My wife and I sat down at the table where Mike and Linda were sitting. Mike turned to my wife and in his quiet way asked her about our family. Christine begins to tell him about our 5 kids aged 1-8, and Mike had a different reaction than most. Most people are more than a little surprised and impressed to hear that you have 5 children. Mike thought it was great but wasn't in the least phased, and continued to ask all about them. After a long period of time, the question was returned. Well the answer floored the 2 of us. I will never forget looking at Mike and especially Linda and being in complete Amazement! I am still in amazement to this day. You are both an inspiration, to balance all the people and things in your lives and to live with such humility is incredible. May God bless you Linda and all the Dilletts during this difficult time. May God also bless Mike, a true gentleman.Peace,Christine and JohnBoston, MALori Koslowski (Selander)December 23, 2009I remember Mike from many soccer events.  He was such a class act and leader for his teams.  Please know your families are in my prayers.Patrick AckerDecember 23, 2009My friend Mike was an inspiration to me and many others. I am a better person because of my interaction with Mike. His goodness (which he had in abundance) rubbed off on me and I noticed it on many people that knew Mike. I will miss him dearly. I will keep Mike's family in my prayers, always.Dave MickDecember 23, 2009Our deepest sympathy to you Linda and your family.Dave and Diane Mick of A.G. IndustriesDecember 23, 2009My thoughts and prayers go out to the entire family and may God bless all of you in this time of sorrow. Tina -Steamfitters Local 601.Colleen RauppDecember 23, 2009My Mom passed away last May.  My siblings, my Dad & I found much comfort from reading entries in her online guest book.  I hope I can provide some comfort to Mike's family at this very sad time.   Mike was a great guy!!  We knew him first from church and through his brother Pat & family.  Then of course through soccer.  Our 4 children all played soccer in some way for Mike.  It's amazing that he made the time for all of his coaching along with his own business and his busy family.   And now Mike has been called home. It's so hard...almost impossible... to understand why.  We will never know.  My guess is that there is a soccer team forming in Heaven & God has sent for one of the best coaches He could find. I can only hope that Mike has found some shin guards for my Mom and has shown her how to put them on.  No more sitting around in Heaven when there is soccer to be played!!  God bless Linda & children, grandchildren, Mike's siblings and nieces & nephews.
