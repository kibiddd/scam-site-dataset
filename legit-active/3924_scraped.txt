DEDICATION OF TEMPLE AND OUR SELVES BEFORE GOD2Chr 6:18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot containthee; how much less this house which I have built!In this out line we look at some points that the dedication of the Temple is also in types required of us as we too dedicate ourselves to God. To serve Him, love Him, and offer our selves as a living sacrifice to Him. Romans 12:1-2 (AMP) I APPEAL to you therefore, brethren, and beg of you in view of [all] the mercies of God, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice, holy (devoted, consecrated) and well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable (rational, intelligent) service and spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this world (this age), [fashioned after and adapted to its external, superficial customs], but be transformed (changed) by the [entire] renewal of your mind [by its new ideals and its new attitude], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His sight for you].I. Would God come to this earth? The answer is YES!Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while wewere yet sinners, Christ died for us.John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begottenSon, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,but have everlasting life.A. In the Old Testament He lived in a temple on earth, but now in us.1 Cor 3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 1 Cor 3:17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.1 Cor 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of theHoly Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and yeare not your own?B. If they where required to keep the Temple holy and clean in the Old Testament that we must also do the same today. We want to please God because of His merciesRomans 12:1-2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
II. With the dedication of the Temple Solomon asks God to look and hear the prayers in this place.2Chr 6:20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldestput thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thyservant prayeth toward this place.A. God not only sees us but also knows the intent of the heart. (Heb 4:12 KJV) For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.B. God answers prayer today when we pray in Jesus Name! (John 16:23 KJV) And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.III. Solomon asked God for forgiveness.2Chr 6:27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.A. We too can do that and have the assurance of sins forgiven. (1 John 1:9 KJV) If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.B. We have the assurance as well. (1 John 3:14 KJV) We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.IV. Prayer in the Temple for healing.2Chr 6:28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, ifthere be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; iftheir enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:A. There is still healing in the Church today. James 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
