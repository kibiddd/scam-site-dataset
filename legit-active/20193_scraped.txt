The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Drew Barrymore has emerged as one of the most iconic and singularly gifted talents of her generation. Born in Culver City, California to John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore, the clutches of fame were virtually inescapable for young Drew, her father being a member of the esteemed showbiz dynasty fronted by stage star Maurice Barrymore, his thespian wife Georgiana, and their three children: Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, and John Barrymore.In the wake of a challenging era fuelled by addiction and media vitriol, an industrious Barrymore threw herself into her work during the early-mid nineties, first with an assortment of "bad girl" parts in cultish B-pics like Poison Ivy (1992), Guncrazy (1992), Doppelganger (1993), and - befittingly - Bad Girls (1994); then, warmly received supporting roles in mainstream fare such as Boys on the Side (1995), Batman Forever (1995), Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996), and Wes Craven's game-changing horror megahit, Scream (1996). Equal portions of goofball - The Wedding Singer (1998), Never Been Kissed (1999), Charlie's Angels (2000) - and gravitas - Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), Donnie Darko (2001), Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) - came next, with a Golden Globe-grabbing pièce de résistance - her divine incarnation of Edith Bouvier Beale in Grey Gardens (2009) - confirming that her skill set was every bit as broad and robust as imagined.Having already birthed an array of projects through Flower Films, the production house she co-formed with Nancy Juvonen in '95, Barrymore fastened an additional string to her bow when she spearheaded the sports dramedy Whip It (2009), her richly appraised directorial debut. Following a steady run of star vehicles at the front end of the 2010s, her tour de force turn as walking-dead suburban realtor Sheila Hammond - on Netflix's Santa Clarita Diet (2017) - saw her step with trademark resolve into newer territory still: the flourishing world of small screen entertainment, a metamorphosis she continues to espouse with her role as compère of spirited daytime staple, The Drew Barrymore Show (2020).BornFebruary 22, 1975More at IMDbProContact infoAgent infoResumeBornFebruary 22, 1975IMDbProStarmeterTop 5,00087Add to listView contact info at IMDbPro
