I loved the location and idea of a Courtyard in a historic building, but was sadly disappointed.  The building is great and the decor gorgeous.  The staff was unfriendly and down right rude.  Front desk staff seemed bothered when I asked for towels at 9:00 PM at night.  Late checkout was denied.  Our room was nice and spacious but needs a bit of update.  TV's were cool. Room just seemed dated and kind of dirty.  The location close to the plaza is awesome, but they have tons of hotels on the plaza and next time I will try a different one.MoreDate of stay: September 2010Trip type: Traveled as a couple2.0 of 5 bubblesValue2.0 of 5 bubblesRooms4.0 of 5 bubblesLocation2.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesService3.0 of 5 bubblesSleep Quality Thank BeachBound816Problem with this review?This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

OkieByChoiceEnid2Reviewed September 26, 2010 I WILL stay here again!!Best hotel stay I've had in several years! The location is incredibly convenient to just about everything in Kansas City. The hotel is clean, comfortable, quiet, and elegant without being overly fussy. The staff is friendly, hardworking, and knowledgeable regarding the surrounding areas and had ready recommendations for shopping, dining, etc. The rooms are well appointed and wonderfully relaxing. My only wish is for a few "California King" beds, as my husband is very tall and longer than regular king-sized beds. Otherwise the hotel exceeded my expectations in almost every way. My visit to Kansas City was greatly enhanced by my stay here!!Date of stay: September 2010Trip type: Traveled as a coupleValueLocationSleep QualityRoomsCleanlinessServiceAsk OkieByChoice about Courtyard Kansas City Country Club PlazaThank OkieByChoice This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

deborahshireAnkeny, Iowa131Reviewed September 24, 2010 Historic charm, modern convenience, great locationCountry Club Plaza shops are just out the back door, and at a rate under $100/night.  Kansas City always treats us sports visitors with warm hospitality, and this Courtyard by Marriott is no exception.  Its 1920's building is on the National Historic Register, and the hotel has done a good job of maintaining its character while offering all the needed updates.  The bathroom was exceptionally lovely and clean.   Free internet connection, nice flat-screen tv.  Decent breakfast buffet offered at a reasonable price (these are usually overpriced, I find.)  Friendly service.  Would definitely stay there again.Date of stay: September 2010Trip type: Traveled as a coupleValueLocationSleep QualityRoomsCleanlinessServiceAsk deborahshire about Courtyard Kansas City Country Club PlazaThank deborahshire This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

maliknycjIndianapolis, Indiana1Reviewed September 24, 2010 Great Service, Location and ValueI travel to Kansas City fairly often and have stayed at several Marriott Hotels in the Kansas City Area. I have to say that the Courtyard Plaza is by far my favorite. It is conveniently located in downtown Kansas City right by the popular Plaza which has great restaurants, stores and a nice park all within waling distance. The Service at this Marriott is incredible as well. At my last stay I accidently left behind a battery for my laptop in my room and I received a phone call from guest services  few days after I left stating that they had my battery. They shipped the battery to my home for no charge because it took them more than one day to call me about the battery. That's wonderful customer service! The hotel is exceptionally clean, very moderately priced and full with very courteous staff. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone spending a few days (or more) in the Kansas City area.Date of stay: September 2010Trip type: Traveled on businessValueLocationSleep QualityRoomsCleanlinessServiceAsk maliknycj about Courtyard Kansas City Country Club PlazaThank maliknycj This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
