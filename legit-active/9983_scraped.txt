I’m an award-winning science journalist and editor based in Madison, Wisconsin, and am executive director and editor-in-chief of The Open Notebook, a journalism nonprofit that I co-founded in 2010 whose mission is to give journalists the tools and resources they need to cover science.
I’ve written and edited hundreds of stories that span many areas of science, from psychology to conservation biology to medicine. My writing and editorial work has appeared in The New York Times, Science, Discover, Scientific American, bioGraphic, Science News, and many other publications.
I’m the editor of The Craft of Science Writing, the second edition of which was published in November 2024 by the University of Chicago Press. I was also first author of the psychology textbook Visualizing Psychology, published by John Wiley & Sons in 2008. I’ve been a member of the National Association of Science Writers since 1998 and was president of NASW from 2018-2020. I’m a member of the Online News Association, the Association of Health Care Journalists, the Society of Environmental Journalists, and other professional organizations. I offer workshops and consultations through The Open Notebook and speak regularly to professional groups and university programs. I have a Ph.D. in social psychology from Yale University and live in Madison, Wisconsin.
