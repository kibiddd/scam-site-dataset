Heroines of the B Western and Cliffhanger
Welcome to the section on the fabulous B western heroines, many of whom also did yeoman duties in cliffhangers.  Will add more as time permits.I also ask any of the website visitors that have more info on these great ladies to send me an e-mail, and I'll be glad to include that in the mini-biographies.  Comments or questions --- click HERE to send an e-mail to Chuck Anderson, the Old Corral Webmaster.Be aware that several of our heroines/leading ladies had multiple names during their careers - examples include Rita Cansino who became Rita Hayworth and Lynn/Lynne Roberts who in her early westerns was billed as Mary Hart.  And there was Sheila Mannors who was also Sheila Bromley, Sheila LeGay and Sheila Manners.
