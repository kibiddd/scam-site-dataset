They aren‚Äôt offensive or brash. They aren‚Äôt anything really. You just hardly notice that they are around. They are kind of like the Minnesota Timberwolves‚Äîit must be something in the water in Minneapolis.The Wild went through a transition last year‚Äîor at least that was the original plan. After Jacques Lemaire had led the team throughout their history to play a system in which defense was all that mattered and offense was an afterthought, new Coach Todd Richards was supposed to turn the team into a far more effective offensive threat.TOP NEWSEvery NHL Team's 2025 Toughest Free-Agent DecisionBleacher Report1dNHL Playoff Standings 2025: Predicting Which Teams Won't Make Postseason BracketBleacher Report1dThe Biggest Regret For The NHL's Most Disappointing TeamsBleacher Report1dIt didn‚Äôt really turn out that way. They dropped from No. 2 to No. 21 in the defensive rankings in the league, and yet had only the 22nd best offense. It‚Äôs no wonder that they weren‚Äôt very good. Needless to say, Richards has some work to do this year.One interesting development with this team is their renewed focus on conditioning in the offseason. Lemaire is an old school guy, so he didn‚Äôt place a lot of importance on offseason workouts. When Richards tried to turn up the speed on offense last year, he found a team that wasn‚Äôt up for the challenge. Players were worked with much more in the offseason, and have been held much more accountable for their physical preparedness in the fall. The impact of that, if it was done well, should show up on the ice.Minnesota Wild Offseason MovesThe Wild cut some fat from the roster, including ancient forward Owen Nolan and useless tough guy Derek Boogaard. They replaced those guys with a couple of veterans in Matt Cullen and John Madden. They added a younger player in Eric Nystrom, who showed some promise with Calgary. Cullen and Madden are both centers who will help the team both up the middle and in the dressing room.Minnesota Wild Predictions: OutlookI don‚Äôt think that this is a playoff team, but they could be in the mix. To do that, though, they will need a lot of things to go right for them. Pierre-Marc Bouchard, who missed all but one game last year with concussion issues, will have to prove himself healthy and productive.Martin Havlat will have to prove that the big contract he got last year wasn‚Äôt a total waste of money. Mikko Koivu needs to take another big step forward. The team needs to learn how to be at least somewhat competent on the road‚Äîlast year they were hopeless.Minnesota Wild NHL OddsMinnesota is 80/1 to win the Stanley Cup. Only the Islanders and the Blue Jackets are longer shots. They get scarcely more respect in the conference, where they are 50/1, or in their division, where they are 20/1. The season point total is set at 85.5.Minnesota Wild NHL PredictionsThe Wild could be in the playoff mix, and a second-place finish in the division and an eighth-place in the conference (and the playoff berth that goes with it) aren‚Äôt out of the question, but I sure wouldn‚Äôt bet on it. I don‚Äôt think that Richards is a great coach, and he doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot to work with here. If everyone played at their best this still isn‚Äôt a very good team.As a hockey handicapper my best guess is that they will finish third in the division ahead of Calgary and Edmonton, but behind Colorado and in a different universe than the Canucks. That would put them 10th or so in the conference.The season points total is pretty tight, but I would lean slightly to the "over." They had 84 points last year and are healthier and fitter to start the season. I don‚Äôt look for a big move forward, but the neighborhood of 88 points would be achievable.03:04 New York Rangers Top 10 Plays of the WeekTOP NEWSEvery Team's Toughest FA Decision ü§îBleacher Report1dPredicting Which Teams Miss Playoffs üîÆBleacher Report1dBiggest Regrets for Disappointing Teams üò£Bleacher Report1dMarchand FA DestinationsüìçBleacher Report13hNHL Playoff Picture üìäBleacher Report11hTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢10hJakob Chychrun, Capitals Agree to $72M Contract Extension Ahead of 2025 NHL PlayoffsBleacher Report‚Ä¢2d5 Landing Spots for Rasmus Dahlin Amid NHL Trade Rumors5 possible teams for the former No. 1 pick defenseman Bleacher Report‚Ä¢1hReport: Russell Wilson, Giants Agree to Contract Worth Up to $21M Amid Rodgers RumorsBleacher Report‚Ä¢13hMen's NCAA Tournament 2025 Power Ranking the Sweet 16 TeamsBleacher Report‚Ä¢13h1 Trade Each NFL Contender Should Consider to Fill Biggest WeaknessTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢10hJakob Chychrun, Capitals Agree to $72M Contract Extension Ahead of 2025 NHL PlayoffsBleacher Report‚Ä¢2d5 Landing Spots for Rasmus Dahlin Amid NHL Trade Rumors5 possible teams for the former No. 1 pick defenseman Bleacher Report‚Ä¢1hReport: Russell Wilson, Giants Agree to Contract Worth Up to $21M Amid Rodgers RumorsBleacher Report‚Ä¢13hMen's NCAA Tournament 2025 Power Ranking the Sweet 16 TeamsBleacher Report‚Ä¢13h1 Trade Each NFL Contender Should Consider to Fill Biggest WeaknessBleacher ReportAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersSitemapCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyCookie PreferencesTerms Of UseB/R Sports on MAXB/R Creators ProgramCopyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
