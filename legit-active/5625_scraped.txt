Decision making function of all political systems: "authoritative allocation of values;" for a typical application, see Beate Kohler-Koch's 1997 essay,
Organized Interests in the EC and the European Parliament, or
Carole Chaney's 1994 essay,
"Gender Differences in Committee Decision-Making: An Experimental Approach"
authority: legitimate power (Max Weber)
power: coercive influence (Harold Lasswell); ability to attain goals against resistance (conceptually from Robert Dahl; my phraseology)
"levels" of the political system: office holders, regime ("rules of the game," norms), and the domain or population subject to the system
