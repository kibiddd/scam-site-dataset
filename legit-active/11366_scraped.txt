That is a clean looking forum.
All the best with it.
I am all for supporting the Government of Macedonia, as long as the Government is supporting Macedonia.

Thanks, it's a message centre more then a forum so I need help regarding activities.
Risto, first we must look after the Macedonians in Diaspora before all is lost forever with mixed marriages etc. What you told Meto applies to 99.9% of the diaspora, we come before any organization or government.

Welcome to MTO, MK.
hey lets support the Government of Macedonia
MK, what is your take on the "Ramkoven dogovor" (aka "Framework Agreeement")?
I am 100% politically opposed against ALL RAMKOVISTS, their supporters and other hangers-on!
Secondly, I have seen (read some of your Maknews postings) that you have a very big soft spot for the anti-Macedonian TATAROMAN "MPO" organisation, too! This, IMHO, will not be entertained much by many of the other MTO forum posters and I say this just to forewarn you on the state of the nation in regards to this topic.
So pochit,
I.
Should you need some further info on the Ramkoven dogovor and the MPO, check out the following links:

indigen, not sure where you live or how old you are; however, I lived through the pre Macedonian Orthodox Church's in North America in 1964 and can tell you that the MPO of then and today are day a night.
Unless you're 50 years or older you can't possibly recognize the changes.

MK - can you expand on your statements here?  What's the difference between MPO then and today?  What changes?

Ivan Lebamoff is dead and George is barely alive (BULGARMANI)
- several church's broke away from the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada, and Australia
- many of their children seldom attend their own events
- very few chapter events period
- several church splits since the beginning
- use to attract 1,000's to their annual convention today 100's
- MPO of today (Andrea Alusheff) supports the Republic of Macedonia
