Imagine a beautiful, intensely fragrant flower with elegant petals that blooms, from a cactus, only one midsummer’s night each year and closes with the rays of the morning sun. Believe it or not, these flowers exist, and few people have been fortunate enough to experience their visual beauty as well as their intoxicating fragrance – until now! “Desert Queen®” is the first fragrance ever created based on the unique Queen of the Night cactus flower.
Queen of the Night: What does it smell like? When does it bloom? Do many people know about this flower?
