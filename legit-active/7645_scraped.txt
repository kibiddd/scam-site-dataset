A champion of the city's neglected minority neighborhoods, DeGraffenreidt served on the commission from 1973-79.
The city also elected its first female mayor, Virginia Young, in 1973.
In 2002, Fort Lauderdale named the recreation center at Bass Park, in the 2700 block of Northwest 19th Street, in his honor.
Also that year, a commission resolution declared DeGraffenreidt an Honored Founder of the city, saying he was ``instrumental in the establishment of a Youth Advisory Board, where young people in the community had a voice in important issues in their lives.''
Former U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw, who served on the commission with DeGraffenreidt, called him a ``historic figure.''
''He had to run citywide, as a minority, but we did the numbers and he would have been elected without the African-American vote,'' Shaw said.
He was the only black to win a seat before commissioners started running by district in 1988, making it easier for minorities to compete.
DeGraffenreidt ''was very gentle, poised, articulate,'' Shaw said. ``He had the respect of all of us on the City Commission.''
When he took office, DeGraffenreidt said he'd fulfilled the Rev. Martin Luther King's wish that people ``will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.''
He resigned the seat to run for the County Commission, but lost.
DeGraffenreidt was born in Kansas City, Mo. He earned science degrees from Mississippi's Tougaloo College -- where he met his wife, Eddie Pearl -- and Pennsylvania State University.
Married for 59 years, they lived in a West Palm Beach retirement home.
DeGraffenreidt taught at Dillard and Piper high schools and Everglades Junior High, where he headed the science department, retiring in 1982.
He served on the boards of Broward County's Urban League and United Way.
''Andy was a mentor to many younger people,'' said Mitch Ceasar, Broward Democratic Party chairman -- who counts himself among them. ``He would spend time with anybody, and he encouraged political activism.''
Ceasar said that DeGraffenreidt's style -- ''direct but not overbearing'' -- enabled him to ``make a point in an adroit way. . . . He was never angry.''
In addition to his wife, a retired teacher, DeGraffenreidt is survived by son Andrew III and daughter Carol -- both Palm Beach County lawyers -- and daughter Fredi Grace Mitchell of Atlanta.
A wake will be held from 5 to 9 p.m. March 6 at First Baptist Church Piney Grove, 4699 W. Oakland Park Blvd. in Lauderdale Lakes, which the family has attended for decades. A funeral will take place at the church at 10 a.m. March 7.

God knew that your dad's work down here had been accomplished, so he summoned him home. I'll always remember Uncle Graff for his wise demeanor, his intellect, positive energy, gregarious laugh, but what I appreciated about him more than anything, was how he always seemed to have a sincere interest in the welfare of others.  I can hear his gregarious voice now, greeting me saying, "Victor James, so how is the Air Force treating you?", and from there we would share genuine dialogue together.Your father indeed was great man, who had the intellect, education, and wisdom to walk with kings, but never lost the common touch, taking time for those less fortunate than himself.Family, we love you, and will continually keep you in our prayers and thoughts....Victor & IdaDelores Oliver CallowayMarch 1, 2009Soror and Link Carol,It is my prayer that precious memories of your father sustain you and your family during this difficult time.
