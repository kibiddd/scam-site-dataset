I think Flatbread pizza is one of Amesbury best kept secrets tuck away in the common I highly recommend it and can’t wait to go again.SterlingAmesburyWe really enjoy going to Flatbread's! They are kid friendly, you're able to see the clay oven they cook the pizza in, they have great pizza with gluten free and vegan options, they're fast and they're reasonably priced. We go every chance we get.RoseNorth ConwayWow, delicious and extremely kid friendly. The staff was very attentive to our needs and made sure the experience was enjoyable. Our toddler really enjoyed watching the pizza being made as well. Never disappointed. MaryProvidenceDelicious Food and Fun to watch the preparation! We loved our pizzas and the accompanying salads. Quite a place --unique and obviously very popular with the locals and tourists. We wanted to return, but ran out of time. It's at the top of our list next visit.CaptainKMLPaiaI cant come to North Conway without stopping here a few times!MatthewNorth Conway“The best pizza around” Sure, Flatbread is popping up all over the place. But this one has so much charm, great service, and amazing pizzas. We were there for St Patrick's day weekend and had one called Irish boiled dinner. OMG, it was so yummy. They should keep it as a regular option!ErinPortland
