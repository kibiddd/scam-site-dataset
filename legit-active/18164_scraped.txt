Mat Adams
“Russ is an exceptional engineer with a unique mix of technical and interpersonal skills.  He is very comfortable deploying and configuring a broad range of network and security devices and has the experience and talent to architect and design solutions for unique environments.  Russ enjoys a challenge and while he never put a customer at risk, he was always willing to explore technical boundaries to meet customers needs.  He made our team stronger and I value the time that we worked together.  ”
Dan Ladik
“Russ is an extremely able and inventive engineer. His work in establishing Security access for users/customers of a Globally Managed Network provided the end users with enhanced capabiliies and significantly decreased the amount of incoming calls for things like resets, stat reports and general status inquiries. It is still in place today.. I would highly recommend him.”
