Please note: Artists not classified as American in our database may have limited biographical data compared to the extensive information about American artists.
Creating biographies or improving upon them is a work in progress, and we welcome information from our knowledgeable viewers.
If you feel you have worthwhile information you would like to contribute, the following means of submission is the most efficient. We welcome your involvement!
1.  For Premier Dealers and museums already
registered with askART your best approach is to log in, choose the artist (once
he/she is in your list of artists), and submit your biography there. If you are
a dealer or museum not currently registered, please
click here to register, and then you may select your artist and submit
a biography.
2.  For all others who have useful information
about this artist, please email the information to
registrar@askart.com. Please note: All biographies will be fully
viewable on Fridays, but the rest of the week biographies are available only to
subscribers.
Biography Guidelines
When submitting biographical information, we appreciate your consideration of
the following:
Please keep in mind that askART is not a promotional site, and accordingly
biographical information should not be worded for purposes of 'advertising' an
artist.
Our site is about PAINTERS, SCULPTORS, and ILLUSTRATORS. If you do not know a great deal about the
artist, but have noteworthy information to share, we would welcome you to send
it also to registrar@askart.com. It
is rewarding for all of us to see artists' files grow, and others may be eager
to supplement what you have provided.
Non-Dealers and Museums:
Please introduce your information as follows: "The following biographical
information has been provided by Jane Doe, the niece of the artist."
Dealers and Museums will be automatically credited with a link to their
sites.
Just the facts, please. Our editors are trained to
delete any hype or advertising verbiage such as “most famous,”
“internationally renowned,” “extraordinarily beautiful works.”
If you do not know a great deal about the artist,
answer as many of the following questions as you can. Other persons, seeing
your entry, often add to the data. This is how many of the biographies
grow.
Please include in your biography answers to as
many of the following questions as possible:
What are the subjects and styles (and other distinctive
characteristics) for which the artist’s work is best known?
Is the artist identified with any particular art movements, or
artists, who influenced his or her work?
Where, when, and under whom did the artist receive education and
training?
Can you provide all relevant personal background
information on the artist?
In which Art Organizations was the artist a member?
Can you provide a list of all major museum and artist
association exhibitions? (excluding commercial art galleries).
What awards or other recognition did the artist win?
What museums (name, city, and state) currently hold
works by the artist in their permanent collections?
Required: What are the sources for your
information? For books, list title, author, date of publication. (Optional:
cite number of pages and yes/no if there are color images.) For magazine
articles, cite title of article, author, title of publication, date, and page
number if possible.
Required: the name of the person submitting the
information.
Dealer Note: Please enter books, periodicals and museum
references in the space provided. Do not combine book information with
biography.
There are many strong biographies that you may refer to on our website, such as
Cecilia Beaux, Edward Hopper, and Paul Sample. Please do not submit biographies
with minimal facts or excessively promotional writing such as the following
(unusable) wording:
What NOT to send:
"The artist John Doe is the quintessential master
of light, color, and scene. His brilliant canvases are full of feeling, where
love can be felt through all the senses. Through his skillful brushwork, and
drawing from his life experiences, he creates images where the viewer feels he
has truly become one with the subject. Doe's paintings are sure to be sought by
the discriminating collector. I/we have numerous spectacular works by Doe
available for sale."
We appreciate your participation in askART. If you have any questions
about submitting biographies, please send them to registrar@askart.com
