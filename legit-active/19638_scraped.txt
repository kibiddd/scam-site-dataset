At New York Climate week, Rich Lesser perfectly summarized the decarbonization challenge for the upstream companies. Take a look below and then let's intensify the collaboration with our upstream and downstream value chain partners!

With Climate Week NYC just two weeks away, my friend and colleague @andreargenton shared this piece discussing how @Dow is taking action on its climate commitments. I’m proud of the work Team Dow is doing to contribute to a cleaner, more resilient world.
“The transition to a low-carbon economy is a game-changer. We know that we can’t grow without decarbonizing, and we can’t decarbonize without growing. By investing in our manufacturing operations, innovating with our customers, and collaborating across the value chain, we can help move the needle on decarbonization in our industry and contribute to a more sustainable future for everyone.”

Agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing one of today's most urgent challenges: climate change. Farmers are at the forefront, requiring tailored solutions that protect the environment without sacrificing productivity.
In 2020, BASF Agricultural Solutions committed to reducing CO2 emissions per ton of crop produced by 30% by 2030 and launched the Global Carbon Field Trial Program. For this reason, field trials were established across key agricultural regions, including Brazil, the USA, Canada, and Europe (Italy, Spain and Germany) focusing on crops such as soy, corn, wheat, rice, and canola to validate our thesis. The first findings of these trials are included on the first Global Carbon Field Trial Report.
After two years of work, we can confirm that reaching out emissions reduction target is achievable. However, the extent of this reduction may vary by crop, existing agricultural practices, local conditions, and weather patterns. Meaningful emissions savings result from combining effective agricultural practices, advanced technologies, and innovative solutions. One of the main takeaways is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. For example, no-till farming is a well-established practice in Brazil and parts of South America, while it is still not being adopted in other regions. This indicates that Latin America has the potential to lead the shift toward sustainable agriculture.
These trials are fundamental for validating climate-smart practices that can be implemented as part of our Global Carbon Farming Program. Insights gained from the different regional field trials are shared with customers and farmers worldwide to identify and tailor the best actions for further CO2 reductions and maximize agricultural output.
Our pursuit of innovative solutions continues, and we remain committed to being a reliable partner for farmers on this transformative journey toward decarbonization and climate resilience.
For more information on the study’s results, I recommend reading the full report:

Mexico’s near-shoring trend will continue, even with the prospect of changes with the incoming US administration as the US and Mexico economies are growing more and more interconnected, said the head of Evonik’s Mexico business.

The #COP29 conference is wrapping up tomorrow. This #COP is coined the climate finance conference. On the wish list is $1T/year to be transferred from developed countries to the Global South. The capital stack is low-cost loans and/or grants. For context, the global GDP is $110T. So, COP is asking for 1% of global GDP per year. One percent seems small, but it is still a lot of money even in the best of times. The details of this climate fund are fuzzy. Who exactly are the developed countries by nations? What are the rubrics to extract funds per nation? Is there a penalty if a nation falls short of its commitment? How do we allocate funds to the Global South? Who are those nations exactly? Is there an audit or assurance that the funds are used to fight climate? Who decides what those projects are? Is there a clawback if the funds are misallocated? At the end, will we achieve the 1.5 C goal or minimize the overshoot? A tough problem indeed.

The US Plastics Pact has released its Impact Report, highlighting
aggregated data from 2023 and accomplishments in 2024! As an activator, Amcor is proud to contribute to building a circular economy for plastic packaging in the U.S.
With more than 130 other organizations, we’re working to ensure that plastics never become waste. Doing this by: Eliminating the plastics we don’t need, innovating to ensure that the plastics we do need are reusable, recyclable, or compostable, and circulating all the plastic items we use to keep them in the economy and out of the environment.
Read the 2023-2024 Impact Report here: https://usplasticspact.org

A Plan is not a Strategy!  Thought you'd enjoy this video on Strategy and Planning from Roger Martin of the U of Toronto. My takeaways: Strategy is why you are choosing your playing field and how to win (be better than others) there. Expectations are a (best) guess- monitor the market and customers and adapt as needed. #strategy #Business #UToronto #Executives #LinkedIn #NPD

I’m always proud to talk about #Nutrien’s potash operations and the commitment of our people to safe and sustainable production.
This story in the Wall Street Journal offers even greater context to our impact on global agriculture – today and into the future.
We’re doing more than mining #potash. Our operations are an essential part of Nutrien’s long-term strategy of feeding the future across the agricultural value chain.

Plastics are too valuable to be lost as waste and should be part of the #circulareconomy. That is why at Dow, we have made a commitment to transform plastic waste and other forms of alternative feedstock to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by 2030.
In line with this goal, Dow has agreed to acquire Circulus, a North American polyethylene recycler, to advance our mechanical recycling offering and add 50,000 metric tons of recycled materials per year to our capacity. This is an important step for us to continue building a materials ecosystem, which includes collecting, reusing, or recycling waste.

With more than 600 million Hispanics worldwide, our influence and impact spans multiple sectors and geographies, driving sustainable and inclusive growth.
That is why, during Hispanic Heritage Month, we celebrate the richness of our roots and the immense value that Hispanic culture brings to the progress of our countries in the economic, cultural and social spheres.  This diversity not only enriches our communities, but also the work environment, generating spaces where all voices can be heard.
Dow  through employee groups like the Hispanic and Latino Network (HLN), we ensure that representation is a priority. The inclusion of diverse perspectives is a key driver of innovation, enabling us to drive a more equitable and prosperous future for all together.
Whether it's commemorating our traditions, doing activities that inspire children to value their roots, or recognizing the contributions of Hispanics to the world of science, art, and culture, this month is an opportunity to reflect and connect.
How are you commemorating Hispanic Heritage Month in your businesses and personally?

Complaining is not a solution (and Nina, I don’t mean you). How do we incentivize brands to provide recyclable packaging, consumers to recycle and governments to provide the necessary infrastructure?  Properly designed EPR schemes are steps in the right direction.

By 2050, #hydrogen could help decrease as much as 80 tons of CO2 from the industrial and transportation sectors. To make this possible, we must protect and maintain access to essential chemistries. Read more from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Through the many conversations I’ve had with industry colleagues leading into INC4, I am encouraged by the high level of alignment on the objective to end plastic pollution and transition to a circular plastics economy. Dow supports an agreement that accelerates our collective work to eliminate plastic pollution from our planet.

Today, we presented the results for the third quarter. Thanks to significantly higher contributions from our core businesses, BASF Group’s EBITDA before special items increased by €77 million to €1.6 billion compared to the same quarter last year. The positive earnings momentum of the first half of 2024 in our core businesses continued in the third quarter, driven by higher volumes and margins. This increase was partially offset by a considerable earnings decline in the standalone businesses.
We are on track to achieve the targeted €2.1 billion annual cost savings by the end of 2026. The implementation of the cost savings programs announced in February 2023 is in full swing. As of the end of September 2024, BASF has already achieved a cost reduction run rate of around €800 million. The associated one-time costs were around €500 million.
Our assumptions for the full year 2024 remain unchanged. We expect moderate growth and to reach the low end of the EBITDA before special items forecast range for the full year 2024. Nevertheless, we must continue to keep potential risks in mind, particularly regarding price declines and volume growth.
I would like to thank all our employees for their tireless efforts. Together, we will move into a successful future with our #WinningWays strategy.

Last week, I wrote about embracing incompetence —  how as we get older, we often fall in love with the comfort of our competence and decide to stop embracing the funny feeling of learning something new.
It got me thinking about how we foster this in those around us.
In my time as CEO I've observed that people who continue to learn and grow usually feel more valued and fulfilled.
This is a good thing for our team and our org, so how do we encourage more learning?
As a leader you have to intentionally foster two things: Margin and Safety
Safety comes in the form of leaders enabling risk-taking and removing fear of backlash if something "goes wrong." It means you clearly outline boundaries and risks that are acceptable to the organization. When something goes sideways the leader takes accountability.
Margin is making sure your team has the time and resources to tinker with new tools, systems, ideas, processes, skills, etc.
The investment is worthwhile, so here are a few thoughts if you want to see your team take on new challenges:
1.) Have you clearly expressed your desire for your team to continue their development?
2.) Does your annual budget and headcount reflect this priority?
3.) When something goes wrong in the organization does your response reflect safety and excitement towards innovation?
If the answer to any of these is. "No." It's worth reevaluating and openly sharing with the team the new change in focus.
And if these things don't come naturally to you, maybe it's a chance to embrace the discomfort associated with incompetence 🙂

Our discussions with industry leaders at the American Chemical Council's (ACC) Annual Meeting centered around 5 key themes:
1. The sentiment of the conference was cautious optimism, reflecting volume recovery and continuing price normalization 🔮
2. Geopolitical uncertainty is limiting decisive investments – Players are making agile and pragmatic no regret moves ⚖
3. The chemicals sector in Europe is at a crossroads – Either government support will bolster the industry, or it will be forced to shrink 💶
4. Capacity increases in China have driven industry overcapacity and challenge global economics 🌏
5. The US is an investment opportunity due to its advantaged feedstock
economics and public sector support 💵
How do these themes resonate with your business? Let's discuss.
