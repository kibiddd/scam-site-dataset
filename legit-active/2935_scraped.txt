Kansas City Royals: Top 10 Prospects

November 17, 2009
General Manager: Dayton Moore
Farm Director: Mike Arbuckle
Scouting Director: J.J. Picollo
FanGraphs’ Top 10 Prospects
(2009 Draft Picks/International Signees Not Included)
The system certainly has some talent brewing, but most of it lies below the double-A level, so fans are going to have to be patient. A renewed emphasis on the draft should definitely help turn the organization around. For more on the ’09 draft picks, see yesterday’s post.
1. Mike Montgomery, LHP, high-A
DOB: July 1989   Bats: L   Throws: L
Signed: 2008 supplemental 1st round – California HS
MLB ETA: late-2011   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Repertoire: 89-95 mph fastball, curveball, change-up
If the organization can find a way to keep its current ace, then it could have a nasty one-two punch at the MLB level with Zack Greinke and Montgomery. The left-hander has flown through the system and will likely open ’10 in double-A. Montgomery, 20, posted a 2.30 FIP in 52.0 innings in high-A in ’09. He allowed just 38 hits and posted a walk rate of 2.08 BB/9. He also showed that he can miss some bats with a strikeout rate of 7.96 K/9. In his career, Montgomery has allowed just three homers in 152.2 innings of work, thanks in part to his solid ground-ball rates. His rate averaged out at 50% for the ’09 season.
2. Mike Moustakas, 3B, high-A
DOB: September 1988   Bats: L   Throws: R
Signed: 2007 1st round – California HS
MLB ETA: mid-2011   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Still just 21 years of age, Moustakas has been hurt by some low BABIPs over the past two seasons: .291 in ’08 and .277 in ’09. As a result, this former No. 1 draft pick’s triple-slash numbers have plummeted each of his three pro seasons. Moustakas is going to have to improve his patience at the plate (6.1 BB% in ’09) but he does flash some raw power (.171 ISO in ’09). A .319 wOBA is not going to make him an impact third baseman.
3. Eric Hosmer, 1B, high-A
DOB: October 1989   Bats: L   Throws: L
Signed: 2008 1st round – Florida HS
MLB ETA: mid-2012   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Big things were expected of Hosmer in ’09, but he struggled with his vision and hit just .254/.352/.382 in 280 low-A at-bats. Curiously, the organization chose to promote the first baseman despite the lackluster numbers. He then hit .206/.280/.299 in 97 high-A at-bats. On the plus side, Hosmer posted a walk rate of 13.6% in low-A, which is extra impressive considering he was not seeing the ball very well.
4. Danny Duffy, LHP, high-A
DOB: December 1988   Bats: L   Throws: L
Signed: 2007 3rd round – California HS
MLB ETA: mid-2011   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Repertoire: 88-93 mph fastball, curveball, slider, change-up
He’s certainly not the hardest thrower in the system, but Duffy knows how to pitch, as witnessed by his 2.84 FIP in high-A ball in ’09. Duffy allowed 108 hits in 126.2 innings of work. He gave up just six homers (0.43 HR/9) and showed solid control with a walk rate of 2.91 BB/9. His strikeout rate dropped from 11.24 in low-A in ’08 to 8.88 K/9 in ’09, but it’s still an encouraging number. A word of caution: Despite his low homers-allowed totals, Duffy is a fly-ball pitcher. He posted a ground-ball rate of just 42.2% in ’09 and 36.6% in ’08, so that suggests he’s going to have to work down in the zone a little more.
5. Tim Melville, RHP, low-A
DOB: October 1989   Bats: R   Throws: R
Signed: 2008 4th round – Missouri HS
MLB ETA: early-2012   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Repertoire: 89-94 mph fastball, curveball, change-up
Melville entered the ’08 draft more highly regarded than organization-mate Montgomery, who has now passed him. Melville had a solid debut year (unlike Montgomery, he did not pitch in ’08) and allowed just 89 hits in 97.1 innings. The right-hander pitches up in the zone more than Montgomery, and he was hurt by a 0.92 HR/9 rate. He also showed less control with a walk rate of 3.98 BB/9. Melville did, however, show the ability to strike out batters with a K-rate of 8.88 K/9.
6. Kila Ka’aihue, 1B, triple-A
DOB: March 1984   Bats: L   Throws: R
Signed: 2002 15th round – Hawaii HS
MLB ETA: early-2010   40-Man Roster: Yes   Options: 1
Ka’aihue was the forgotten man in the organization while Mike Jacobs played everyday and provided below average production (-0.7 WAR). Despite slugging 38 homers in ’08, the 25-year-old spent the entire year in triple-A where he hit .252/.392/.433 with an ISO of .181 in 441 at-bats. Ka’aihue walked 102 times on the year… or six fewer times than Jacobs has in the last three years combined. If Kansas City is not going to take him seriously as a cheap source of power, it should do the slugger a favor by trading him.
7. David Lough, OF, double-A
DOB: January 1986   Bats: L   Throws: L
Signed: 2007 11th round – Mercyhurst College
MLB ETA: mid-2010   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
The 23-year-old Lough had a breakout ’09 season and could be the best in-house option to eventually replace David DeJesus or Coco Crisp (when they are deemed too expensive). Lough, though, is probably still a year away from being ready to play everyday at the MLB level. In ’09, he began the year in high-A and hit .320/.370/.473 in 222 at-bats. He then moved up to double-A where he hit .331/.371/.517 with a .186 ISO in 236 at-bats. Lough stole 19 bases but was caught eight times, and he needs to get on base more frequently (4.8 BB% in double-A) to take advantage of his speed.
8. Jeff Bianchi, SS, double-A
DOB: October 1986   Bats: R   Throws: R
Signed: 2005 2nd round – Pennsylvania HS
MLB ETA: late-2010   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Finally healthy, Bianchi showed consistency in ’09 and reached double-A. In high-A ball, the shortstop hit .300/.360/.427 in 220 at-bats. Moved up to double-A, Bianchi responded with a triple-slash line of .315/.356/.441 in 270 at-bats. He also stole 22 bases on the year and was caught just six times. The 23-year-old infielder strikes out too much (21.5 K%) for his modest power.
9. John Lamb, LHP, rookie
DOB: July 1990   Bats: L   Throws: L
Signed: 2008 5th round – California HS
MLB ETA: late-2012   40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Repertoire: 87-91 mph fastball, curveball, change-up
Lamb did not pitch after signing in ’08, so he made his pro debut in ’09 and pitched well at two rookie ball levels. Overall, he allowed 57 hits in 68.2 innings and showed good control with a walk rate around 2.70 BB/9. Despite an average fastball, Lamb used his control and deception to strike out almost one batter per inning. He should jump to low-A in 2010, and he still has a long way to climb before reaching Kansas City.
10. Tyler Sample, RHP, rookie
DOB: June 1989   Bats: L   Throws: R
Signed: 2008 3rd round – Colorado HS
MLB ETA: mid-2013  40-Man Roster: No   Options: 3
Repertoire: 89-94 mph fastball, plus curveball, change-up
This ’08 draft pick gets lost in the shuffle behind some of the bigger names, but Sample had an impressive year in ’09. The right-hander allowed 41 hits in 54.2 innings of work while posting a strikeout rate around 8.00 K/9. His control is still a work in progress, but it was right around 3.60 BB/9. Sample posted a modest 43.4% ground-ball rate, but he allowed just two home runs (0.16 HR/9).

Surprised that Wil Myers isn’t here.  Has he not had enough pro playing time yet to make the list?

2009 draftees are intentionally left off the top ten lists, not enough professional data, I suppose.  Hopefully Aaron Crow would be on this list too, if he were eligible.
