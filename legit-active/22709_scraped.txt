Énergie
Énergie is a Canadian radio network of French-language contemporary hit radio outlets broadcasting throughout the province of Quebec and portions of eastern Ontario, in Eastern Canada. They offer a personality-driven mix of francophone and anglophone pop hits and cutting-edge programs, catering to a young adult audience. Although the flagship station is CKMF-FM Montreal, the 10 stations in the network usually have their own talent and format for each of their own markets. They are owned by Bell Media.
Most, but not all, Énergie stations broadcast in the same markets as Bell's adult contemporary network Rouge FM.
History
In December 1988, Énergie was created.
In 2006, Astral Media programmed a satellite radio channel, branded as Énergie2, for broadcast on Sirius Canada and Sirius Satellite Radio, on channel 89. This channel offered essentially the same format as the terrestrial network, and was hosted by Richard Fortin and Nicolas Wilson. However, the Énergie brand was entirely discarded in September 2010, as Sirius Canada acquired the channel, dropped the English artists and renamed it as Latitude franco.

.quebec
.quebec is a new GeoTLD and Community Priority Application that was proposed to ICANN's New gTLD Program by PointQuébec, a non-profit organisation. The organisation aims to improve the businesses, culture, tourism, and online identity of Quebec and the Quebecois through the .quebec TLD. According to the PointQuébec organisation, .quebec will allow all Quebecers to register their domain names under .quebec.
PointQuébec's application for the GeoTLD was approved, and was delegated to the Root Zone on 16 April 2014. The application was supported by the Quebec National Assembly and other cultural, technical, and economic institutions in the city. It received "substantial financial support from the Québec government", and is a not-for profit organisation. The organisation will verify legitimate registrations via statements of intent through a post-verification registration system. quebec officially launched on November 18, 2014.
Along with TLDs such as .cat and .africa, .quebec and other new TLDs fall into the new category of GeoTLDs. The issue of new top level domains in general and .quebec in particular has been discussed at various ICANN-Meetings since 2005.

Quebec
Quebec (i/kwᵻˈbɛk/ or /kəˈbɛk/; French: Québec [kebɛk]) is the second-most populous province in Canada. It is the only Canadian province that has a predominantly French-speaking population, and the only one to have French as its sole provincial official language.
Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay, and Hudson Bay; to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay; to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; it is bordered on the south by the province of New Brunswick and the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia.
Quebec is Canada's second most populous province, after Ontario. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area, including the Island of Montreal. English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Eastern Townships, and Gaspé regions. The Nord-du-Québec region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples. The climate around the major cities is four-season continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions. Even in central Quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are very severe in inland areas.

Quebec (AG) v Canada (AG)
Quebec (AG) v Canada (AG) 2015 SCC 14 is a Canadian constitutional law case concerning the federal government's ability to destroy information related to the Canadian long-gun registry pursuant to the federal criminal law power.
Background
In 1995, Parliament passed the Firearms Act, which required long gun owners to register their guns. The Supreme Court found that the Act was intra vires the federal criminal law power. In 2012, Parliament repealed the requirement to register long guns through the Ending the Long-gun Registry Act (ELRA) and sought to delete the information in its registry. The province of Quebec, wishing to create and maintain its own long gun registry, requested that the federal government share the data it had collected about Quebec long gun owners. When the federal government declined to share the information, Quebec argued that section 29 of the ELRA, the provision disbanding the long gun registry, was ultra vires the federal government.
At trial in the Superior Court of Quebec, the trial judge found that section 29 was unconstitutional as it violated the principle of cooperative federalism given that Quebec had take part in "gathering, analyzing, organizing, and modifying" the data in question. The trial judge required the federal government to share the information with Quebec.

Quebec City | Real 8K
Original content filmed and edited in 8K resolution.
Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

Québec: A Discourse on Nations   |   Chapter I - Née dans les lis.
"Québec: A discourse on Nations" is a three-part documentary series exploring the concept of nationhood through the example of the Canadian province of Québec. In these videos we aim to explore the many phases and evolutions of French Canadian identity, while also exploring the history of Canada with a focus on this region of the country.
In this first episode we explore the very origins of this story -- from its very origins. Going from the arrival of the Early First Nations to the aftermath of the British Conquest, looking through the history of New France: The French North American colony, and the reason why there are French people in Canada in the first place. Our objective with this video will be to lay out a comprehensive background to then proceed with the developments of the XIXt...

Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

Traveling to Quebec? Not Sure What to Expect in Quebec? Here we go through what you should know about Quebec, Canada before you go. From the amazing European atmosphere with fantastic food and architecture to great museums and family activities like the Aquarium of Quebec to the not so great parts of trying to find parking, dealing with some of the rudest tourists in Canada and some other unfun things.

We LOVED our time in Quebec City! It is definitely one of the most beautiful cities we have ever visited plus the people were kind, the food was fabulous, and it had so many options for budget-friendly activities.  We had no idea how much we would actually spend but it ended up being less than $100 per person per day and we felt like we had a luxurious time.

"Québec: A discourse on Nations" is a three-part documentary series exploring the concept of nationhood through the example of the Canadian province of Québec. In these videos we aim to explore the many phases and evolutions of French Canadian identity, while also exploring the history of Canada with a focus on this region of the country.
In this first episode we explore the very origins of this story -- from its very origins. Going from the arrival of the Early First Nations to the aftermath of the British Conquest, looking through the history of New France: The French North American colony, and the reason why there are French people in Canada in the first place. Our objective with this video will be to lay out a comprehensive background to then proceed with the developments of the XIXth century.

Looking for the best things to do in Quebec? Look no further! We'll show you the best things to do in Montreal, Quebec City, Mont Tremblant, and more~
Québec was the fifth province we visited on our 150-day road trip across Canada and in this video, we share some of the best things to do in Quebec!
Learn more about Quebec at https://www.mustdocanada.com/things-to-do-in-quebec-city-in-winter/
Québec is a big province full of history, nature, and diverse cities. As Canada’s only primarily French-speaking province, it’s quite different than the rest of the country. Also, due to the complicated history between the English and the French, Québec has always strived to create and keep its own identity, which is quite apparent in the pride they have for their own flag and other cultural practices. We learned so much during our time in the province and had a lot of fun exploring the cities and the surrounding nature.

With historical cities like Old Québec, diverse cities like Montreal, and natural attractions like Mont Tremblant and the St. Lawrence Saguenay Seaway, Québec is an exciting province to explore.
Canada's Road to 150 is a 150-day Canada-wide multi-media road trip celebrating Canada's 150th birthday by exploring the uniqueness of this country provincially and collectively while answering the question; What makes Canada special?
We will drive to and through every driveable province and territory, showcasing Canada's natural beauty and regional attractions while interviewing Canadians of all cultures and backgrounds, including local celebrities, immigrants, refugees, and everyday rural and urban Canadians. Our aim is to dig deep into what makes Canada such an incredibly inspiring country while showing off the best of Canada's tourism to Canadians and to the world.

How Quebec Plans To Save Itself From English
How Quebec Plans To Save Itself From English
Quebec is the only province in Canada where francophones make up the majority of the population, and for Quebecers, preserving the French language is the only possible safeguard for the survival of the Quebec identity and culture. So in a world where everything is dominated by English-speaking media, this is how Quebec is trying to save their province from anglicisation.

Quebec City | Real 8K
Original content filmed and edited in 8K resolution.
Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

Quebec is the only province in Canada where francophones make up the majority of the population, and for Quebecers, preserving the French language is the only possible safeguard for the survival of the Quebec identity and culture. So in a world where everything is dominated by English-speaking media, this is how Quebec is trying to save their province from anglicisation.

Join me as I tour around some of the cities most famous sites like the Old Town, Dufferin Terrace, the Citadelle, Plains of Abraham and of course Petit Quartier Champlain.

You can buy the packages for shorter trips as well, but they're especially fantastic for digital nomads and nomads who want regular health insurance when they are abroad.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Quebec: https://www.expedia.com/Quebec.d180017.Destination-Travel-Guides
You don’t need to go all the way to France to say “Bonjour” and nibble on croissants. #Quebec maintains strong ties to its French roots, which date back to 1608. The town’s official language is French and it’s even home to a replica of Norte Dame.
While on #vacation here, mosey around the cafes and shops in North America’s oldest retail district, and #visit the Musee de la Civilisation. Embark on a Quebec City #tour around the colonial buildings in Dufferin Terrace, the history at Battlefields Park, and the stunning beauty of Montmorency Falls. From the Saint Lawrence River to Fontaine de Tourny, there are endless attractions to experience in Quebec’s capital city.
When you’re looking to indulge in a little European flair, without leaving North America, explore Quebec City. To further fuel your adventures, check out our travel guide video and pick up more tips and recommendations.
For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

You don’t need to go all the way to France to say “Bonjour” and nibble on croissants. #Quebec maintains strong ties to its French roots, which date back to 1608. The town’s official language is French and it’s even home to a replica of Norte Dame.
While on #vacation here, mosey around the cafes and shops in North America’s oldest retail district, and #visit the Musee de la Civilisation. Embark on a Quebec City #tour around the colonial buildings in Dufferin Terrace, the history at Battlefields Park, and the stunning beauty of Montmorency Falls. From the Saint Lawrence River to Fontaine de Tourny, there are endless attractions to experience in Quebec’s capital city.
When you’re looking to indulge in a little European flair, without leaving North America, explore Quebec City. To further fuel your adventures, check out our travel guide video and pick up more tips and recommendations.
For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

The travel health insurance I use - PassportCard Nomads: https://www.passportcardnomads.com/?ref=alinamcleod
*I highly recommend this travel health insurance because you don't have to pay out of pocket for your medical expenses and they have very reasonably priced long term plans. You can buy the packages for shorter trips as well, but they're especially fantastic for digital nomads and nomads who want regular health insurance when they are abroad. I am an affiliate of this company, but of course use the plans myself.

Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."

Traveling to Quebec? Not Sure What to Expect in Quebec? Here we go through what you should know about Quebec, Canada before you go. From the amazing European atmosphere with fantastic food and architecture to great museums and family activities like the Aquarium of Quebec to the not so great parts of trying to find parking, dealing with some of the rudest tourists in Canada and some other unfun things.
The best and worst of Quebec City, Canada.

We travel with a Microsoft Surface everywhere we go. I edit my videos on it & use it to backup my pictures and vides while we travel. It’s light and the best travel laptop on the market in my opinion.
https://amzn.to/2L55pDR
We use Sony Alpha series cameras to film our videos. They are compact so you don’t look like a super tourist when you take great pictures and videos while you travel.
https://amzn.to/2WbTNFH
We use Manfrotto Tripods. They are compact, travel well, and honestly I would not use another tripod for my nice cameras.

Travel Plug that works in pretty much any country & has four USB ports. A must for any traveler.

We LOVED our time in Quebec City! It is definitely one of the most beautiful cities we have ever visited plus the people were kind, the food was fabulous, and it had so many options for budget-friendly activities.  We had no idea how much we would actually spend but it ended up being less than $100 per person per day and we felt like we had a luxurious time.

"Québec: A discourse on Nations" is a three-part documentary series exploring the concept of nationhood through the example of the Canadian province of Québec. In these videos we aim to explore the many phases and evolutions of French Canadian identity, while also exploring the history of Canada with a focus on this region of the country.
In this first episode we explore the very origins of this story -- from its very origins. Going from the arrival of the Early First Nations to the aftermath of the British Conquest, looking through the history of New France: The French North American colony, and the reason why there are French people in Canada in the first place. Our objective with this video will be to lay out a comprehensive background to then proceed with the developments of the XIXth century.

Prologue: Ice and Fire (4:19)
Part I: Je me souviens  (11:14)
Part II: La Conquête/The Conquest (35:26)
Part III: Never will be slaves (45:49)

Looking for the best things to do in Quebec? Look no further! We'll show you the best things to do in Montreal, Quebec City, Mont Tremblant, and more~
Québec was the fifth province we visited on our 150-day road trip across Canada and in this video, we share some of the best things to do in Quebec!
Learn more about Quebec at https://www.mustdocanada.com/things-to-do-in-quebec-city-in-winter/
Québec is a big province full of history, nature, and diverse cities. As Canada’s only primarily French-speaking province, it’s quite different than the rest of the country. Also, due to the complicated history between the English and the French, Québec has always strived to create and keep its own identity, which is quite apparent in the pride they have for their own flag and other cultural practices. We learned so much during our time in the province and had a lot of fun exploring the cities and the surrounding nature.

With historical cities like Old Québec, diverse cities like Montreal, and natural attractions like Mont Tremblant and the St. Lawrence Saguenay Seaway, Québec is an exciting province to explore.
Canada's Road to 150 is a 150-day Canada-wide multi-media road trip celebrating Canada's 150th birthday by exploring the uniqueness of this country provincially and collectively while answering the question; What makes Canada special?
We will drive to and through every driveable province and territory, showcasing Canada's natural beauty and regional attractions while interviewing Canadians of all cultures and backgrounds, including local celebrities, immigrants, refugees, and everyday rural and urban Canadians. Our aim is to dig deep into what makes Canada such an incredibly inspiring country while showing off the best of Canada's tourism to Canadians and to the world.

Énergie
Énergie is a Canadian radio network of French-language contemporary hit radio outlets broadcasting throughout the province of Quebec and portions of eastern Ontario, in Eastern Canada. They offer a personality-driven mix of francophone and anglophone pop hits and cutting-edge programs, catering to a young adult audience. Although the flagship station is CKMF-FM Montreal, the 10 stations in the network usually have their own talent and format for each of their own markets. They are owned by Bell Media.
Most, but not all, Énergie stations broadcast in the same markets as Bell's adult contemporary network Rouge FM.
History
In December 1988, Énergie was created.
In 2006, Astral Media programmed a satellite radio channel, branded as Énergie2, for broadcast on Sirius Canada and Sirius Satellite Radio, on channel 89. This channel offered essentially the same format as the terrestrial network, and was hosted by Richard Fortin and Nicolas Wilson. However, the Énergie brand was entirely discarded in September 2010, as Sirius Canada acquired the channel, dropped the English artists and renamed it as Latitude franco.

How Quebec Plans To Save Itself From English
Quebec is the only province in Canada where francophones make up the majority of the population, and for Quebecers, preserving the French language is the only possible safeguard for the survival of the Quebec identity and culture. So in a world where everything is dominated by English-speaking media, this is how Quebec is trying to save their province from anglicisation.

Quebec City is a little taste of Europe in Canada! From its charming cobblestone streets, historic architecture and chic bistros and cafes, you definitely don't feel like you're in Canada any more. Join me as I tour around some of the cities most famous sites like the Old Town, Dufferin Terrace, the Citadelle, Plains of Abraham and of course Petit Quartier Champlain. Of course you most try some REAL maple syrup when visiting Quebec, as well the national dish of poutine! Hope you enjoy the video and visit this amazing city yourself someday!

The travel health insurance I use - PassportCard Nomads: https://www.passportcardnomads.com/?ref=alinamcleod
*I highly recommend this travel health insurance because you don't have to pay out of pocket for your medical expenses and they have very reasonably priced long term plans. You can buy the packages for shorter trips as well, but they're especially fantastic for digital nomads and nomads who want regular health insurance when they are abroad. I am an affiliate of this company, but of course use the plans myself.

You don’t need to go all the way to France to say “Bonjour” and nibble on croissants. #Quebec maintains strong ties to its French roots, which date back to 1608. The town’s official language is French and it’s even home to a replica of Norte Dame.
While on #vacation here, mosey around the cafes and shops in North America’s oldest retail district, and #visit the Musee de la Civilisation. Embark on a Quebec City #tour around the colonial buildings in Dufferin Terrace, the history at Battlefields Park, and the stunning beauty of Montmorency Falls. From the Saint Lawrence River to Fontaine de Tourny, there are endless attractions to experience in Quebec’s capital city.
When you’re looking to indulge in a little European flair, without leaving North America, explore Quebec City. To further fuel your adventures, check out our travel guide video and pick up more tips and recommendations.
For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Original content filmed and edited in 8K resolution.
Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. Is also one of the oldest European cities in North America. In the first day of filming we really forgot that we were on an American continent. This city feels so European that we felt like we were filming in France.
"With a cliff-top position above the St Lawrence River and captivatingly picturesque old streets, North America’s oldest French-speaking city is a gorgeous, seductive place."
