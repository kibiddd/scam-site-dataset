"Dad turns 81 years old [on Friday]. That's just the reality. It's going to be a tough battle, and we're trying to see what we can do to assist his progress every day."Starr Jr. said he plans to attend Sunday's playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys at Lambeau Field. It's the first Packers-Cowboys' playoff game in Green Bay since the Ice Bowl, when Starr Sr. beat the Cowboys on a last-second quarterback sneak to win the 1967 NFL Championship. Starr Jr. attended that game as a 10-year-old.
