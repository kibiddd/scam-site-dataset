Welcome to the Montreal History Website MontrealHistory.org
The construction for the Mechanics’ Institute of Montreal was finished in 1920. This elegant building houses the oldest subscription library in Canada. After it was established in 1828 the Institute provided the working population with technical knowledge and training. Embodying the mission and ideals of the organization, the building interior is decorated with sculpted medallions representative of the mechanical arts, as well as marble and oak. The exhibit rooms, lecture hall, classrooms, and reading rooms continue to serve their initial purpose, and The Atwater Library remains to be the last working Mechanics’ Institute building in Canada. Speaking of famous Canadians, we couldn’t leave the most successful gamblers aside. According to history, it is believed that Canadians learned the art of gambling from settlers, and at first, they started playing various card games, like poker and blackjack. David Baazov is a famous gambler from Montreal who definitely deserves to be on the top of the list of most successful gamblers in Canada’s history.
