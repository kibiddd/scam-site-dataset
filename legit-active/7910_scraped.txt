I am a Hyde researcher.My GGG Grandfather was John Hyde who lived in Lincoln Co., NC in the mid to late 1700's.I have always heard that our Hyde ancestors had a lot of money over in England.However, I have not been able to trace the connection between this John Hyde and his family in England.I would be very interested in any information that you have found.It was also said that there was a connection to the two Hyde women that were queens in England.No proof of any of this.Carol Hyde Wahl
