Green Day – American Idiot                                lyrics
Don't wanna be an American idiot.
Don't want a nation under the new media.
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America.
Welcome to a new kind of tension.
All across the alien nation.
Everything isn't meant to be okay.
Television dreams of tomorrow.
We're not the ones who're meant to follow.
For that's enough to argue.
Well maybe I'm the faggot America.
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.
Now everybody do the propaganda.
And sing along in the age of paranoia.
Welcome to a new kind of tension.
All across the alien nation.
Everything isn't meant to be okay.
Television dreams of tomorrow.
We're not the ones who're meant to follow.
Okay, if that's enough to argue.
Don't wanna be an American idiot.
One nation controlled by the media.
Information nation of hysteria.
It's calling out to idiot America.
Welcome to a new kind of tension.
All across the alien nation.
Everything isn't meant to be okay.
Television dreams of tomorrow.
We're not the ones who're meant to follow.
For that's enough to argue.

My favorite quote: people are effing idiots! Hello, American Idiot, kinda fits that. Perfectly. Media sucks, and look at stupid things like the commercial for The Wave. They expect us to run out and buy it because Vanessa Hudgens supposedly uses it, and we do! Are people really stupid enough to believe that she uses it? She's getting paid people! Look at how every single one of Miley Cyrus concerts is Always full. (Btw, she really sucks) It's because everyone has made her seem completely perfect, and that she can do no wrong, and this is the stupidest, greediest country, because all anyone cares about is having money, and having people know who they are. Most people get some strange joy out of having random people know their name. Me? It creeps me out. (have you ever had someone you don't know come up and say "Hi! (Insert your name here) What's up?" It is just weird! This song describes this perfectly. What is the enjoyment out of being famous? Not having the freedom to walk out of your own house without being bombarded by people who just want their fifteen minutes of fame? What kind of life is that? Sorry about my little rant, I get carried away easily.

Alot of you got pretty close but What the song is really getting at is how media is tailored to implant ideas in peoples heads. It works so well that entire cultural movements are being manufactured daily. Trash tv and reality shows are there to foster negative emotions in people. Trash/smut/criminal behavior is glorified to keep the people in the gutter. Racism is cultivated in the media, why do you think mtv and others pump out so much Stereotype orientated content. Its like when people wind up liking music that is utterly horrible and devoid of any talent or musical merit. They only like it because its repeated over and over and over. Till you can't get away from it.   Laws are passed based on propaganda campaigns like the whole second hand smoke nonesense, There is nothing (till this day) nothing concrete, no evidence whatsoever, that smoking has a large impact on the health of people who do not smoke, there never was. But Every idiot and their mother is convinced that youll die of cancer if someone lights up next to you. Way to instigate paranioa! Now the new thing is salt and overwieght people.  This Govt is driving us to ruin and they do it in our name and funded by us!  We have the right. And actually it is our duty to rebel. Govt's power comes from its people, and they have you so wrapped up in tv nonesense that most don't even care. The founding fathers  knew we would have to rebel again that's why we have the rights we do. If they take those rights away we are slaves through and through. . And anyone who would support the removal of such rights is an enemy of the american people.

This is so like Canada from Hetalia Axis Powers. I mean he doesn't want to be an American Idiot, seeing as America is his brother. I heard somewhere that Canada is slowing "becoming" America, as in the culture and food, and heck, even the media. It goes to show how easily America is swayed by the media, and that everything is in sort of a hysteria mode. It can also stand to show how American youth today are being influenced by the media, wanting to become the movie and television stars.

I'm not about to spout my political ideas, here, as so many of you have. And fookedinny, you are awesome. If you look at what you wrote, it sounds dangerously close to the ideas represented in Farenheight 451, by Ray Bradburry. If you haven't read it, please do.
The ideas of this song, that the media is controlling America, is what that book is all about. And if you pay attention to what Bradburry thought the future would be like, its a hell of a lot like what we have today - right down to 3D flatscreen tv's tha overtake our lives - and he wrote it in the 1950's.

Uhm. Wow. I have to agree with essentialmama! All anyone ever gets is sugar-coated fluff. And when they do get facts, like how many people died in the war, they forget its A freaking war! People die! And I know people are losing their loved ones, but they knew there was a war going on and that there was a possibility that they were going to die for this country! They knew what all the possibilities were. Those men and women out there are the bravest this country can put in uniform and send to defend. Yes, it is a pointless war, but its not over untill its over. We can't just run away from our mess again just because people died. If you're so worried about adults dieing, why don't you worry about all the children being kidnapped, starved, and sent to war in Africa? At least ou soldiers are being fed and cared for.
I just wish everyone wasn't so concerned with how everyone feels and more with things like finding out how to take care of everyone. We complain about the economy, yet buy everything from China. I hate how stupid peole are.

I totally agree with Rock-Goddess. The song is about beeing you, and not beeing affected by the media. And face it, X--Ebony: You could never rule over America. And not to be bitchy, but America is kind of an idiotic country.  I am glad I don't live there! Ok, they might be one of the most powerfull countries in the world, but the president is an idiot. I'm sorry, but I'm glad we have a king instead of a president. If you're wondring: Yes, I'm not an America-fan. And I honestly think Norway is the place to live.

This song is saying that it is over-rated, be your own person, and don't let the media, control what you do. The media, and celebrities control everything we do now, and yeah America is stupid. Yes other countries have models, and fashion shows, like France, but America is the worst. We are the laziest, we just sit around and do very few every day, we practically crave the media, and we are obsessed with hearing about celebrities that are just horrible, and we don't even care what is going on. Global warming is going to happen, and usually all people think is 'eh whatever I won't be alive then', or 'Well that's a good thing we can walk around in bathing suits all the time' Not Right people! Sorry for my rant!

I believe this song gets lots of criticism because it seems to be against America. However, that's not the case. Billy Joe even said that it was meant to be a wake up call to explain what is wrong with our country. He has the right to express his opinion on these issues, right? When he says, "F**k America... " he's not wanting to do anything bad! America is f**ked up already, and he's pointing that out!

Okay so I am sorry but seriously all these people saying all/We/those Americans are lazy are really getting on my nerves. Don't classify everyone in America as lazy and media worshiping fools. No, we are not all like that so don't generalize. I hate it when people do that. If you're one of those people then just talk about yourself. America was built through sweat and hard work. Maybe some Americans have forgotten that, but a lot of us haven't. This song is awesome but it doesn't pertain to every American.

Alright, many of you may know that the American Idiot album has been turned into a Broadway Musical, but a lot of people still don't understand the concept behind it all.
American Idiot is the opener, sung by Johnny (known in the album only as Jesus of Suburbia), and his friends Will and Tunny. They are fed up with the suburban-american way of life, angry at the media-controled nation they live in, and express their frustration in this song, which is followed, just like in the album, by Jesus of Suburbia.
(For anyone that read Hazeldountlovesbullet's explinations on the album, I am actually her. I had to create a new account because the old one was deleted).

I am an American citzen and I find this song extremely insulting. Most Americans are not ignorant, and most of us do pay attention to the truth. Randal, if you really think that Bush was such a bad president, look at our current one. He wants to take away all guns, and make it manditory that we enter a police force that will enforce his thoughts without question. Though I am all for standing up against authority when it is wrong, I think you need to get your politics right. Sociallism is bad, people!

Sheeple. That's what we are a nation of. American Idiots! No one does their homework, and most people believe what the media and governement people tell us. Sheeple. Being led to the slaughter. And because we don't know our own history! That's right. We don't know squat about American History. We may know some facts, but the reasons things happened are either watered down or completely twisted to suit the agenda of those telling the story. "Propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist." -Garth S. Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell, Propaganda and Persuasion.

Schmuk: I actually thank you for your entertainment. People like you are the ones who are ruining this nation! Ignorance is not a good thing. You would do the world good if you knew that. Learn up! :) And if you actually pay attention to reliable news sources like fox, or the nra, you would realize what our current president is doing to this nation. It's actually kind of sad to see people trying to insult the greatest nation on Earth. We have freedom, liberty, and justice, and we enjoy every moment of it! For all you other nations out there, we hope you'll join us one day, and make it a better place. :) Oh, and Schmuk: I find it interesting that you call me the idiot when you can't spell "amerucan" right. A-M-E-are-I-C-A-N :)

I'm an American and I like this song. To me it means that most Americans follow the media and masses. Our last president took away some checks-and-balances all by saying "9-11" and people willingly bought it. I was considered unpatriotic by objecting. One of our founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin stated "Those who give up a little freedom for a little security deserve neither."
So this song reminds me of the 1960's where rock music was about standing up to authority when it is blatantly wrong.

These Green Day songs show once again that many people have figured out how to make a name for themselves and a living by ripping the country that has given them everything. These so called musicians have 'created' a product that fits the template of the left wing media who are always more than happy to sell it for them when it agrees with their agenda. When was the last time you heard anything in the media - movies or songs - that spoke about the beauty or how America gives to the world's needy, etc, etc, etc? And these twenty somethings can write about some distorted view of this country and make a living while doing it here in America? Can there be any doubt that the American Idiots are Green Day?
