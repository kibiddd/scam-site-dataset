SMAP (Sports Music Assemble People) were a kind of Japanese version of the Monkees, only more enduring and commercially
successful. Besides being the country's most popular boy-band (and J-Pop's best selling group ever), they also presented their own
variety shows, made commercials and frequently appeared in trendy TV dramas. As the brightest stars in the ubiquitous
Johnny's Jimusho (Johnny & Associates) talent agency, they had a lot of clout behind them,

Singles such as Gambarimasho, Celery, Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana were huge
sellers. Even the departure of Mori in May 1996 to pursue a career as a motorcycle racer couldn't stop the SMAP juggernaut. Thanks
largely to their popularity, Johnny's Jimusho became easily the most successful agency in Japan, with earnings of almost 3 billion
yen in 1995.
