Great, more Top 40 baloney.
I'll forever miss the Alice 102 format which I fell in love with while living in KC and which saved me from more Britany, Justin Timberlake, and other repeat junk.  I no longer had to listen to 70's/80's "Oldies"...I was introduced to so much terrific music via this station and am grateful I have found at least replacement in the Bay Area, but there will only be on Alice in my heart.  I'll also miss the DJs who made my workdays much less mundane.  Good luck to them.
It's all about the Benjamins...
