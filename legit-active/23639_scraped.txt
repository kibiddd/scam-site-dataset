JENNIFER
GRANT
According to Cary Grant his daughter, Jennifer, was his best production. From the number of e-mails
I receive asking about Jennifer, it would appear that a lot of you think so too! And so I've added this page. If
you can give me  information to add to it, I would be most grateful.(FYI
- the above photo was NOT autographed to me personally!
I'd been looking around for a photo of Cary's best gal, but
hadn't ever found one till one day this one popped up on eBay.)Christmas
Lullaby/Here's
To You - Grant really made only one record, a 45
rpm.  He made it in October 1967, inspired by the birth of
his daughter. (from
Cary Grant: A Bio-Bibliography - Beverley Bare Buehrer)Biography
Born: February 26, 1966
Father: Cary Grant
Mother: Dyan Cannon
Jennifer was born two months premature and weighed only 4.5 pounds.
After her parents were divorced in March 1968, Jennifer spent time with both her mother and her father.
Jennifer's first school was Buckley, a private school in Van Nuys.
As a young child, Jennifer naturally wanted a pet, but Cary did not like household animals. Instead he bought
her a horse and Jennifer became an accomplished rider.
Being the daughter of Cary Grant meant that offers from studios for parts in movies were made to her at a very
young age, but Cary and Dyan both felt that she should have a normal childhood. It was obvious, however, as Jennifer
grew older that Cary did not want his only child to follow in his footsteps. Despite numerous offers made to her
by studios desperate to cash in on both her name and good looks, Jennifer studied at a succession of private schools
before going on to Stanford University to study Law.
After graduating with honors from
Stanford in 1987, Jennifer worked on projects for the homeless with
a public interest law firm in San Francisco.  However, she decided to go against her
father's wish, and enrolled in an acting class. After several years of trying different jobs, she finally
started work as an actress when she won a regular part in TV's Beverly Hills 90210.
Has been married to TV executive Randy
Zisk, divorced 1996(?).
Film & TV

Later she took a guest spots in Friends & Ellen, and she has had a role in the film Evening Star.
Most recently, Jennifer has starred in the TV Sitcom "Movie Stars".
