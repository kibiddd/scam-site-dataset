total bullshit. Sharing incredible music never killed anyone and its not like the Dead cant afford it after all these years.This show isnt a monumental one at all to say the least but one should be able to enjoy this and all shows in their car or anywhere a CD can be appreciated.

bombs left and right it just makes you feel like your going to blow out the speaks.Also scarlet- fire just makes you want to just get up and dance dance dance the truckin made you just want to sing every word to the song the dark start thourh dark star is just filled with trippy sounds done by the boys and to rap the evening the werewolves of london was the best way to end the crazy night of great and powerful music the boys did in the there last few years so if you can some how find a copy of the show its a must have in the collection.

3 Minutes of Pure Raw Dead
The Kesey eulogy of Bill Graham is extremely overpowering and makes me cry every time. You can feel the raw energy from Ken's voice, and the background

music is a very jazzy-free form jam with a lot of power behind it. It's just under 3 minutes, but there's a short window that feels like the quintessential raw power that only the Dead could deliver, ala 1967-1971.
