this thing, my thing, one thing, take it all back from me
i'll do what you want you scare me, and you puch my back cause you know my one thing, i can feel you now my thinking, take this back my evil one thing, take this back
this thing, my thing, one thing, take it all back from me
you see in me, what i have left for you, you see in me, why you think i left this for you, you see in me, now that its' over, you see in me
and the farmer says to his garden, your gonna die soong, and the doctor says to his patient, your gonna die soon, and the leader says to his nation, your gonna die soon, and the god says to his creation, your gonna die now
