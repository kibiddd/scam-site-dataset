From the Chicago
Defender Newspaper:
McGill Appointed State's Attorney
"This is not a southern interracial society gathering, but one of your boys
who could not rise in the South. This could not happen there. We are pointing out to you the advantages of living
North, where a man with an education and a trade or profession is given a chance.
Attorney N.K. McGill (with hand upraised) receiving the oath of office as assistant State's Attorney, who has practiced
his profession for years in Florida, has been told often that if he were white he would be a state's attorney.
His color alone prevented him from receiving in Florida what he has in Illinois. In Illinois, he is a state's attorney;
in Florida, no matter how well trained he was, his color barred him.
Editor Abbott, standing between State's Attorney Crowe (extreme left) and his secretary, Lawrence Cuneo, discovered
Attorney McGill and informed him that while he was needed in the South, where good lawyers are in demand, there
was no future for him nor his family there, and encouraged him to come North. The above is the result. Others in
the picture are Ed. Wright, conceded to be the power of our Race and looked upon as the leader and spokesman for
Cook county and the State of Illinois. At the extreme right is Alderman Louis B. Anderson of the Second ward.
From left to right the men are: State's Attorney Crowe, Editor Abbott, Lawrence Cuneo, Attorney McGill, Ed. Wright
and Alderman Anderson.
In acknowledgment of the service rendered to the Republican party of Cook county by the Chicago Defender, State's
Attorney Robert E. Crowe appointed Attorney N.K. McGill Assistant State's Attorney of Cook county Tuesday afternoon.
Attorney McGill has already been assigned to duty in court.
The new assistant is a man of exceptional ability and rare legal talent. He is a graduate of Boston University,
Boston, Mass., and has been practicing law for 10 years. Prior to his advent in Chicago he was an accredited member
of the law firm of McGill & McGill of Jacksonville, Fla. in which place enjoyed the distinction of being a
member of the state bar as well as being admitted to practice in the he United State Supreme Court. He is attorney
for the Chicago Defender and several other corporations. He has been a member of the Illinois state bar for eight
years.
Mr. McGill's appointment in Chicago is one more example of the Defender's contention that the North is the only
place for our Race in this country. His appointment could have happened only in a place where there is social equality,
upon which all other forms of equality are based. In the South, in spite of all the Interracial commissions, our
people are Jim Crowed and humiliated at every turn.
Even in Florida, where Attorney McGill's ability as a lawyer was recognized, he could never aspire to be anything
more than a practicing lawyer, and even then not entirely secure. The Defender urges our people to come and live
where a dollar is worth at least 98 cents and you have a chance to fight for the other 2 cents. In the South a
dollar is not worth 1 cent in your hands.
Attorney McGill, whose wife is Mrs. Idalee McGill, is a brother-in-law of Robert S. Abbott. The couple have two
boys, N.K., Jr., and S.D., 6 years and 9 months old, respectively.
