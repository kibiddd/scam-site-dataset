The Silent Ballet: Volume 4
Spring 2007
With spring in full season in the Northern Hemisphere and summer just around the corner, The Silent Ballet and Lost Children Net Label present the fourth volume in the the ever evolving Silent Ballet Compilation series. Volume IV focuses on the upbeat energy and feelings that surround this irresistible season, as well as the laid back spirit that accompanies late night stargazing and the freedom intrinsically tied with the first day of summer vacation.
Additionally, Volume IV continues the tradition of showcasing new, innovative artists emerging onto the larger global scene. Many of these acts are supporting  self-released CDs, and we strongly encourage listeners to delve deeper into those musicians that pique an interest. It is through your support that the community thrives.
As the compilation series expands, we at The Silent Ballet are always looking for ways to keep it an exciting experience for our listeners. Within the span of time between this release and the next, The Silent Ballet will turn one year old, and to celebrate we are happy to announce that the second year of our existence will see the release of a physical compilation. Of course, this won’t be just any normal CD, but at this point in time we are not at liberty to divulge more than that..

About the Artist
Alan is narcoleptic by day, insomniac by night. As such, he frequently
confuses reality and dreams, which is only worsened by his deep adoration of
David Lynch films. There’s aMatrix reference in here somewhere, but I doubt
it’s highly relevant to the artwork featured here. Our deepest gratitudes go
out to Alan for this piece; truly it is A+ material.
Those interested in contacting Alan for other projects should do so at
alan@thesilentballet.com
