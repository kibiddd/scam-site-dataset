Dorothy Revier, known as “The Queen of Poverty Row” for her work in a string of low-budget silent films and early talkies, has died in Los Angeles. She was 89.
Miss Revier died Nov. 19 at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, according to Richard Lamparski, a film historian.
She lived in West Hollywood.
Born Doris Velegra in San Francisco, Revier was a professional cabaret dancer when a talent agent spotted her.
She made her first film, “The Broadway Madonna,” in 1922.
Dozens of film roles followed, most of which cast her as a femme fatale. She was the villainous Milady DeWinter opposite Douglas Fairbanks in “The Iron Mask” in 1929.
Industry observers dubbed her “The Queen of Poverty Row” for her work with Columbia Pictures, then a low-budget studio.
