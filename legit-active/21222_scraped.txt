Nature Foundation will once again start its after school Snorkel Club Program on Wednesday May 23rd 2012 under the theme "Wild 4 Life". Wild 4 Life is an initiative of the Nature Foundation and the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance to introduce children to Marine Conservation on St. Maarten and in the rest of the Dutch Caribbean.  The Nature Foundation, in a continued effort to educate and stress the important role the youth plays in the future of nature conservation on this island, established the Snorkel Club program with the aim of educating local youth in snorkeling skills and marine conservation. Children will be given a total of ten lessons with each lesson consisting of both theory and practical elements.Lessons will include snorkeling skills, marine naturalist courses, introduction to SCUBA diving, hiking tours, and a special closing activity. Children who attend the Snorkel Club are given a copy of the How to Snorkel Manual, a Nature Foundation T-shirt, Fish Identification Cards and wetsuits for sun protection, all of which they can keep.After graduating from Snorkel Club the children will have the opportunity to continue on to become Nature Foundation Junior Rangers. The Snorkel Club program was made possible through the generous donation and support from various businesses who contributed to the Rockstars for Nature event earlier this year. The popular local Band Orange Grove has also continuously supported Nature Education on St. Maarten through promoting the Nature Foundation Snorkel Club trough various outreach activities conducted earlier this year and through donating a percentage of their sales during events held on the island.Interested parents can contact the Nature Foundation at 5444267 or via email at This email address is being protected from spambots.

Parents are urged to register their children early due to limited space.
