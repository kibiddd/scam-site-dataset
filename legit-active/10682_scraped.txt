Posted on Thu, Feb. 18, 2010 Backers of African-centered education strongly oppose school closings By JOE ROBERTSON The Kansas City Star Kansas City’s Afrikan Centered Education Collegium Campus struggled a quarter-century for its three-building campus at Southeast High School. The hundreds of supporters of ACE who packed Thursday night’s school closings forum made it clear they have no intention of letting any of it go, marking the strongest resistance yet to Superintendent John Covington’s unprecedented "rightsizing" school closings plan. "The right size plan is the wrong fit!" ACE board leader Ajamu Webster yelled, leading rows of standing parents in chorus. "It’s the wrong fit! It’s the wrong fit, for ACE!"

Personally, I see nothing wrong with introducing African history/culture into a curriculum. But to make it the entire focus of a school seems to do a disservice to the kids.

I bet these kids still probably couldn’t name ten African countries or famous Africans.

Agreed. The kids should be studying history of all cultures. When they talk about afrocentric they are talking about fantasy history (of course not in their minds).

"nothing wrong"There's nothing wrong with studying the history and culture of people from different nations. But these schools are AFRO-CENTRIC!!! schools. They sublimate the idea of being American to the idea of being "African". Analysis by respected professionals concerning the curriculum and ideas promoted by these types of schools is withering in their criticism. American schools should be teaching children how to be good Americans and inculcating some kind of bogus foreign culture/standard on them.

The school taught the same world and American history, its founders said, but with an African-centered vantage point Read more: Backers of African-centered education strongly oppose school closings - KansasCity.com  I don't know what exactly they mean by this.

That makes sense. I looked at a video of the schools - at least the students have to wear coats & ties.

I could care less about their African history or culture, how are they doing in math and english? If they are actually performing then at least they are throwing money into the right place for a change.

If you read the article the KC School system wants to close half of the schools. This is the same district that a judge ordered the state of Missouri to funnel billions of dollars into. Part of the purpose was the build magnet schools to attract whitey from the burbs but that failed and test scores continued to be horrible.
Does the cirriculum at the Afro-centric school include female circumscion, putting light tires on necks of political opponents, how to build an army of children, the use of rape and amputation in war, and how great a leader Mugabe is?

Found a typo at 2008-2009 Standards of Academic Learning and Behavior: If the scholar does not show ant improvement, he or she will be demitted.  http://apps.kcmsd.net/acecc/pdf/Standards.pdf

“Afrikan Centered”?
As in Afro-centric, like the “Rev.” Jeremiah Wright’s Temple of Racial Hatred that the Obamas were members of for years and years (yet claimed they didn’t know about the racist content of the “Rev’s” sermons)?

I wonder if that “African-centric” education involves spending a week studying the prosperous, peaceful paradise that is Zimbabwe. Or perhaps the Congo.

They can become fluent in Swahili. That’s real useful. Learning Arabic or Chinese is 100x more useful especially if you eventually work in commerce

“...African-centered education...”
We evolved from the Stone Age a LONG time ago, why go back?
