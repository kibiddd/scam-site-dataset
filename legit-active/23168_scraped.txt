Why choose us
Demand Manager has been in the industry since 2005, providing:
Reliable cashflowWith good turnaround times, and certificate bulk-processing, we meet core business needs allowing clients to focus on their sales and service.  Truly independent advice and serviceDemand Manager is not aligned with any particular efficiency product or technology, we share knowledge with our clients and share their business goals. Success oriented servicesDemand Manger does not charge a fixed price - all our services are offered on a success-fee basis.
What our clients sayWhenever we need any sort of advice as to the validity of particular jobs for example, for instance whether to replace panels or acquire STCs, Demand Manager has been very helpful. They’ve made enquiries to regulator and got back to us straight away.Matt VellaManaging Director-MVP GroupWe find Demand Manager very easy to work with, they understand our business and we have a good relationship. Their manner of work is conducive to getting things done rather than putting up hurdles. They will work with you to get the job done and they often translate the scheme requirements to ensure compliance.
www.todaesolar.com.auTirone KahnGeneral Manager-Todae Solar If we don’t stay on top of things, we can fall behind in business.  We have to constantly see how the market is changing, what LED technology is coming and how that is driving the clients choices, how they are performing in the market. Demand Manger has been refreshing in the industry for me. They are not just sitting still and seeing what’s happening but looking for opportunities. And I like that.Ross WhitfieldDirector-INTU ConsultingThe Australian Technology Park (ATP) at Eveleigh launched its sustainability strategy and action plan in late 2010. Initiatives to date have significantly enhanced the NABERS ratings of all ATP buildings. The NICTA building is currently rated at 5½ stars; one of only 17 buildings in NSW to have achieved this. With electricity efficiency gains of 38% achieved sofar, the prospect of further financial incentive through the generation of Energy Savings Certificates became an added bonus. Demand Manager has been a valuable partner in the process, professionally and patiently guiding ATP through the regulatory maze to very satisfying conclusions. I cannot recommend Demand Manager highly enough.Gary LoveHead of Facilites-Australian Technology Park
