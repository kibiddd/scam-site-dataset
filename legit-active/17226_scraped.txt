MG-409. ORAL HISTORY COLLECTION.
Tapes in the Oral History Collection are divided into twenty
projects of interviewing carried out in various Pennsylvania cities by staff members of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. These interviews shed light on the daily lives of African Americans, European immigrants, Hispanics, and Jews in the Commonwealth. Indexes of the contents as well as transcripts are available for many of these tapes.
Three of the projects focus exclusively on the lives of African Americans. These are the Harrisburg, Chester, and West Chester projects. In the Harrisburg project, the thirty interviews focus on the lives of Black women who migrated from the South and lived in an uptown neighborhood. Collateral material includes a booklet, Glimpses Into Our Lives: Memories of Harrisburgâs Black Senior Citizens, written at the Harrisburg Uptown Senior Citizen Center, and two half-hour videotapes. The thirty West Chester tapes focus mostly on the Depression and the 1940s and how the color line was broken. The Chester City project includes twenty tapes, which are rich in material dealing with employer-employee relationships, religious life, racial strife, and political corruption. Some of the tapes in the latter collection are restricted.
Three of the collections that include Black history tapes are still growing since the projects continue. These are the Pittsburgh Oral History Project, the Chester County Library Oral History Project, and the Central Pennsylvania Collection. Thirty of the 280 tapes in the Pittsburgh project focus on Black steelworkers in McKeesport, Homestead, and South Pittsburgh. Some of these contain vivid descriptions of neighborhoods, religious life and employment. The Central Pennsylvania Collection produced by the Oral History Project at Pennsylvania State University, Capitol Campus, contains nine tapes on African American life and history in Pennsylvania.
Finally, there are three tapes of interviews with Andrew M. Bradley, the first African American to serve in a governorâs cabinet in Pennsylvania. Bradley was secretary of the budget, and later head of the Department of Property and Supplies under both Governors George M. Leader and David L. Lawrence, serving from 1957 to 1963.
