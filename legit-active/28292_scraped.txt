(June 17, 2010) -- The Arena Football League (AFL) announced that a franchise will return to Kansas City for the 2011 season. The Likens Family, under the direction of Chris Likens, returns to the helm of Kansas City's AFL franchise following the suspension of the 2009 season. The AFL resumed play in 2010 with 15 teams and a new economic model and leadership. The season runs from April to July."The return of arena football presents a unique opportunity to give back to citizens throughout the region-both in the form of entertainment as well as in community and charitable endeavors," said Chris Likens. "I always believed that Arena Football would return to Kansas City - we were simply awaiting the right circumstance. The optimal circumstance has presented itself and, as a lifelong Kansas Citian, I look forward to the opportunity of joining the legacy of generosity evidenced throughout this community in and out of sports.""Kansas City's enthusiasm for Arena Football is unmatched and interested observers from around the country are floored by the passion of AFL fans in the market," said Jerry Kurz, Commissioner of the Arena Football League. "The expansion committee was impressed with Likens' Family efforts to connect with the community and their resolve during a time of uncertainty."Originally granted a franchise in Jan. 2006, the Kansas City Brigade quickly established a reputation for unique, fast-paced brand of football and entertainment - welcoming sellout crowds of more than 12,000 fans. In the 2008 season, the Brigade moved their home games to Sprint Center, Kansas City's award winning downtown arena, bringing action packed indoor football to capacity crowds."Suspending operations for a year allowed the league to restore its viability and properly position the AFL for sustained, future success," said Likens. "A key part of both our historical and future success is our General Manager, Kevin Porter."Kevin Porter returns to the Kansas City Brigade as General Manager. With 10-years of coaching expertise, Porter will run the day-to-day football operations of the club. Following a stellar football career at Auburn University, including second team All-American honors, Porter was drafted in 1988 in the third round of the NFL draft and played for six years with the Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets as cornerback and safety. Porter completed his undergraduate degree in business at Avila University. During the next few weeks, Porter will work on the coaching situation for the 2011 season.The newly configured AFL now has one of the best economic realities in all of professional sports and consists of teams from Alabama, Arizona, Bossier-Shreveport (La.), Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Iowa, Jacksonville, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Spokane, Tampa Bay, Tulsa and Utah. Additional franchises have been awarded to Philadelphia and San Jose for the 2011 season. The single-entity ownership league has a TV deal with the NFL Network.Fans may reserve their right to purchase AFL season tickets for a $25 refundable deposit beginning today.
