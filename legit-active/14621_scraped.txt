Online sports betting in Texas is keenly sought after by thousands within the state. However, sports betting online has not yet been legalized in Texas. Indeed, the state is one of the most ardent in terms of anti-gambling across the United States.
However, in Texas, players can sign up for offshore sports betting accounts. Offshore betting sites have gained their license from a jurisdiction outside of the US which has legal online gambling. Nobody has ever been prosecuted for signing up to such sites. These sites also keep your account, funds, and identity completely secure.

Reviews of Texas’ Top Online Betting Sites
Further to our list of the top ten Texas sports betting sites, we have reviewed the top five in-depth. All of these are completely accessible from within Texas. They are also all licensed to ensure fully safe and secure sports betting.
1. BetOnline – Best Online Sports Betting in Texas for 2025
BetOnline is a clear choice for our number one Texas sports betting site. The platform offers comprehensive sports betting, regular bonuses, and plenty of other facets that enable enjoyable online gambling in Texas.
BetOnline sign up bonus guarantees you up to $500 worth of free bet bonuses just to begin with. If you continue to bet with BetOnline, you can claim reload deposit boosts every time you fund your account.
You can finance your account through traditional currency or via one of 16 different cryptocurrencies accepted on their platform. This ensures so many different ways to play for online sports bettors in Texas.
BetOnline ranks as the best site for a variety of the biggest US sports leagues too, including the NFL, NBA, and NHL. Although live streaming is not available, their live betting is among the quickest.

What we like:
Comprehensive sports betting options
Reload bonuses on every deposit
Quick live betting
Vast array of cryptocurrencies accepted
What we don’t:
No live streaming
2. Bovada – Fastest Sportsbook for Live Betting in Texas
One of the most recognizable offshore betting names is Bovada. Bovada has gained its reputation for a reason as the excellent sportsbook is also great for live betting.
Bovada’s odds are very quick to update during live events, while you also have the option of live streaming while betting. This means you will be able to watch the most up-to-date action and inform your live bets accordingly.
The futures markets at Bovada are also impressive. Regardless of how far in the future the event is occurring, Bovada makes sure markets are updated regularly.
The only slight drawback is the availability and ease of contact with the customer service team. However, you are unlikely to find anything wrong, especially given the gentle terms and conditions attached to their welcome bonus and other Bovada promo code offers.

What we like:

Well-informed futures markets
What we don’t:
Slow customer support channels
3. Everygame – Best TX Hockey Betting Site
Everygame is another of the more well-known sports betting brands that we recommend in Texas. The two elements that stand out from a betting point of view are their hockey markets and their lines on college sports.
Although betting on the NHL takes precedence, there are extensive markets for European hockey too. As such, props and totals are offered in detail on many matches. This is also the case with NCAA football and basketball.
Everygame deposit bonus is much smaller than some of their rivals though. This is a shame as the terms and conditions are generous. Meanwhile, there are also plenty of betting tournaments to enjoy as an existing customer.
When it comes to payment methods, four different crypto coins are accepted at Everygame. However, unlike most sites, the perks of using crypto do not extend as far as others. Traditional payment method users will receive just as many bonuses.

What we don’t:
Small welcome promotion
4. TG Casino – Sign Up Quickly via Your Telegram Account
The newest site within our top ten is TG Casino. While this goes against our general preference for more established online sportsbooks in Texas, TG Casino’s platform is unique. They also have fantastic sports betting to boot.
TG Casino is one of the first online sportsbooks available within a mobile app. Although this is not their own app, you can sign up via Telegram in under a minute. Using Telegram also keeps you anonymous.
The rapid speed with which you can sign up also extends to payouts. As transactions with digital currencies are quick, you can deposit and withdraw funds from your TG Casino account within a minute.
While TG Casino is still growing, they are still a great site for esports betting in particular. Similarly, you can use one of ten different cryptocurrencies to claim a massive 200% welcome bonus up to 10ETH.

What we don’t:

5. BetUS – Offers the Largest Welcome Promotion
While BetUS proudly positions Americans at the forefront of its brand, it remains an offshore betting site.
Texan bettors stand to claim the most substantial welcome bonus available at BetUS, potentially amounting to $3,750 in free bet bonuses. Although a portion of these bonuses is designated for casino use, BetUS maintains robust sports betting markets. This strength is particularly evident in football betting, with comprehensive offerings in props and totals. The NFL and CFL markets consistently feature options both for and against the spread.
The BetUS deposit bonus impresses with a relatively modest 10x rollover requirement, but it comes with a somewhat high minimum deposit of $100. This may dissuade the more casual Texas sports betting enthusiasts.
However, BetUS excels in customer support, delivering prompt and helpful feedback. Additionally, even for those utilizing traditional currency, BetUS ensures payouts within an expedited timeframe, typically under 72 hours.

How We Select the Best Texas Online Sports Betting Sites
Our best Texas online sports betting sites are ranked using our sportsbook ranking criteria which include some of the following factors:
Range of Bets: All types of bets should be taken into account. Moneylines may be the most popular, but our experts want to see detailed props and futures too.
Choice of Events: A range of NFL, NBA, and NHL markets should be offered. However, for greater diversity, there should be betting markets on more niche sports too.
Bonuses & Promotions: While welcome bonuses are always popular, it is better for a site to offer regular competitive promos to existing customers.
Safety & Security: A site should offer measures such as two-factor authentication and self-exclusion. There should be no question as to whether your funds are in safe hands.
Payment Methods: It is no longer acceptable for a sportsbook to rely on debit/credit cards and bank wire transfers. Cryptocurrencies and eWallets should be offered too.
Customer Support: All channels – whether that’s live chat, email, or phone – should be highly responsive. Trained agents should be readily available to assist you.
Is Sports Betting Legal in Texas?
In 2025, online sports betting in Texas remains illegal. The state is one of those with a more hardline stance against gambling. This means any legislation regarding legalizing online wagers looks to be a long way off. It is extremely unlikely anything will happen in 2024.
This means that if a sports bettor wishes to gamble in Texas, they need to sign up with an offshore sportsbook. These sports betting sites are fully licensed, so are operating legally within their jurisdictions. They are not based within Texas, but players within the state can sign up without fear of prosecution.
Latest Texas Sports Betting Updates
May 2023: The legislative session in Texas concludes without any forwarding of sports betting motions for the year.
May 2023: The Texas Tribune reports that final approval is close for the two sports betting-related bills.
April 2023: Two separate sports betting bills are passed by the Texas House Committee on State Affairs. One relates to retail betting and the other to online betting.
January 2023: The Texas Sports Betting Alliance is formed. This comprises of well-known names such as FanDuel, DraftKings, and Fanatics Sportsbook.
Texas Senate – Bills and Motions
Texas Sporting Betting Legalization Amendment – This amendment would have pushed to legalize sports betting. However, it was not included on the state’s ballot in November 2023.
HB1942 – The House Bill which made it to the legislative session in May 2023. This failed to attract enough support and did not pass before the end of the session.
Who can Bet on Sports in Texas?
Betting on sports is not legal in Texas, so nobody can sign up for any site claiming to be licensed within the state.
Offshore sportsbooks are available though. Anyone over the age of 21 can sign up for these sites without risking prosecution. Players under the age of 21 cannot register with an offshore sportsbook though.
Pros and Cons of Using One of These Online Sportsbooks in Texas
Offshore sportsbooks may initially draw concern from players in Texas who wish to bet on sports. However, there are several advantages to using these sports betting sites regardless of whether locally regulated options are available. These include:
Pros
Cons
Multiple payment options
Less social interaction
Bigger bonuses
Risk of addiction
Increased security
Possible technical issues
More international sports to bet on
No physical cash withdrawals
Cryptocurrency banking available
College sports betting options
Offshore Texas Online Betting Sites vs. Regulated US Sportsbooks
It can be difficult to choose between offshore online betting sites and regulated sportsbooks in states where sports betting is legal. However, players in Texas require offshore sports betting sites to gamble online so the decision is easy. Offshore betting sites do offer some advantages though, including:
Financial Security: Offshore sportsbooks tend to be more secure financially, as they are more established.
Betting Market Range: Betting markets tend to be significantly more varied. This is down to where they are based and how established they are.
Transaction Speeds: Due to the availability of cryptocurrencies, transaction speeds can be almost instant. You will often have to wait 3-5 days for payouts on regulated sites.
Types of Bonuses Available
Plenty of different bonuses exist to keep online sports bettors happy in Texas. The below table outlines what you can expect, and when, as far as promotions go.

Popular Texas Online Sports Betting Markets
There are many different types of bets and this helps to keep sports betting as interesting as possible for online bettors in Texas:
Moneyline: A bet on the moneyline is one on a team or individual to win their match. In sports like soccer, this can also include a bet on a draw being the outcome.
Spread Betting: A spread is a handicap that is applied to a match between two teams or competitors. This makes the odds as even as possible between them.
Totals: A bet on the number of goals, points, touchdowns etc. occurring during a sporting event. This is often expressed as over or under a specified amount.
Prop Bets: A bet on a specific event happening that does not directly affect the result such as a red card or a buzzer shot.
Futures: A bet on an event happening well in the future. These are not like moneyline markets. One example is pre-season futures betting on the team to win The Vince Lombardi Trophy.
Parlays: A combination bet comprising any of the above. All outcomes predicted in parlay bets have to happen for a player to win.
Live Betting: A bet placed while an event is ongoing.
The best sportsbooks incorporate the vast majority of popular betting markets for Texas sports bettors. You can find out whether your favorite types of bets are held at each site below.

Sports Betting Apps in Texas for iPhone & Android
Betting apps in Texas are split into two big camps. One is for iPhone and iPad users, and the other is for Android users. The good news is that the top operators cater to both sides and ensure great compatibility across iOS and Android devices. Let’s take a closer look to see how the two versions differ.
Texas Sports Betting on iPhone
The iPhone sports betting experience in Texas is awesome. If the sportsbooks have native apps, they usually launch the iOS ones first. These are available on the Apple App Store, so users can easily download and install them.
If you want to bet on mobile sites, these are generally optimized for Safari on iPhone models. As a result, compatibility shouldn’t be an issue here, and you can connect right away. iPhone betting is also very secure.
Texas Sports Betting on Android
While Android devices aren’t as popular as iPhones in Texas, players can benefit from great Android sports betting apps. One downside is that the installation process is not always smooth. Some sportsbooks can have Android sports betting apps on the sites, and this requires a few more steps to install them.
However, all of the best sports betting sites in Texas run perfectly on Chrome, Mozilla, and other browsers on Android. They keep the same features, like live betting, streaming, and secure banking, so users benefit from the full experience. At the end of the day, both iOS and Android are great for mobile sports betting in TX.
Mobile Sites vs. Best Sports Betting Apps in Texas
There are some differences between using a mobile site and downloading a native app for betting on sports. To help you find the best fit for you, we will cover these two options in more detail below.
Sports Betting Mobile Site
Using an instant-play mobile site for betting on sports is the most convenient option. You can start right away, and you don’t have to worry about compatibility. Plus, all of the best mobile sportsbooks in TX have optimized sites for smartphones and tablets.
What we like:
Available instantly from the web browser
No need to install additional applications
Users don’t waste time with app updates
Supported by all of the best Texas betting sites
What we don’t:
Doesn’t support fingerprint sign-in
Not available as a single tap start
Sports Betting Apps in Texas
TX sports betting apps can take longer to install, and they also take up storage space on the device. However, they are generally better optimized for the respective operating system, and updates target the bugs directly. Betting apps, in general, also provide the convenience of starting with a single touch of the screen.
What we like:
App icon available on the home screen
Extra sign-in options (face, fingerprint)
Layout designed for mobile devices
Easy access to multiple sportsbooks
What we don’t:
Difficult to download and install
Stricter compatibility requirements
How to Create a Betting App for a Texas Sportsbook
Since not all online sportsbooks have native apps, you can create web apps for mobile sites. This is actually much easier than it sounds, and it only takes about a minute.
You can then enjoy the benefits of an instant mobile site and the accessibility of having an app on the home screen. We will quickly guide you through the process on an iPhone, but the steps are similar for Android as well.
Step 1: Go to the Mobile Betting Site
Start the web browser and go to the online sportsbook from your phone. For this example, we will be using Bovada on Safari.
Step 2: Open the Page Options
Tap on the menu icon from the dashboard at the bottom. This is the menu from the web browser and not from the mobile betting site.
Step 3: Add to Home Screen
There is an option to add the app to the home screen as part of the menu. This basically adds a shortcut of the site to the home screen of the device.
Step 4: Name the Web App
You can choose the name of the new Texas sports betting app. It will then appear on your phone, and you can move the icon to where you want it.
Step 5: Open the Texas Sports Betting App
You have successfully created an app for your favorite TX mobile sports betting site. Now, you can start it just by tapping on the icon.
Land-Based Casinos With Sports Betting in Texas Near You
There are currently three tribal casinos that offer land-based gaming for residents in Texas. However, none of these currently offer any form of sports betting.
