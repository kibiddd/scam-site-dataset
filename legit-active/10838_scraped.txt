As Nature Intended
Imagine a 100-mile stretch of North America's longest river, a vestige of the untamed American West. The Missouri National Recreational River is where imagination meets reality. Two free flowing stretches of the Missouri make up the National Park. Relive the past by exploring the wild, untamed and mighty river that continues to flow as nature intended.

National Park Service – Missouri National Recreational River Find Your River Trailer SDH script 3/9/20 ♫ [ Music plays ] ♫ FEMALE VOICE: It’s beautiful. The sky is always a little bluer and the grass is a little greener when you’re floating down a river. MALE VOICE: To our visitors I think it’s an opportunity for them to get a sense of what the old Missouri River was like. FEMALE VOICE: Every season has its different phases and a different beauty to it. MALE VOICE: It’s a part of who we are. It’s a part of what America represents…this old time river…this relic from the past. FEMALE VOICE: It gets in your blood. It gets in your system. It becomes a part of who you are. ♫ [ Music plays ] ♫
