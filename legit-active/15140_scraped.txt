History
Parts of traditional living areas with old houses were altered to support private projects by eminent domain legislation. Many of the former farms of Long Branch were transformed into residential "suburbs". Long Branch is a City (New Jersey) in Monmouth County, New Jersey County, New Jersey, United States. The famous Long Branch Saloon of the American Old West, located in Dodge City, Kansas, was originally named that by its first owner, William Harris, who had moved west from Long Branch, New Jersey, his hometown. Long Branch still continues however to be a popular resort area.
