If an image is displaying, you can download it yourself. (Some images
display only as thumbnails outside the Library of Congress because of rights
considerations, but you have access to larger size images on site.)
Alternatively, you can purchase copies of various types through Library
of Congress Duplication Services.
If a digital image is displaying: The qualities of the digital image
partially depend on whether it was made from the original or an
intermediate such as a copy negative or transparency. If the Reproduction
Number field above includes a reproduction number that starts with
LC-DIG..., then there is a digital image that was made directly
from the original and is of sufficient resolution for most publication
purposes.
If there is information listed in the Reproduction Number field above:
You can use the reproduction number to purchase a copy from Duplication
Services.  It will be made from the source listed in the parentheses after
the number.
If only black-and-white ("b&w") sources are listed and you
desire a copy showing color or tint (assuming the original has any),
you can generally purchase a quality copy of the original in color by
citing the Call Number listed above and including the catalog record
("About This Item") with your request.
If there is no information listed in the Reproduction Number field
above: You can generally purchase a quality copy through
Duplication Services. Cite the Call Number listed above and include the catalog record ("About This Item") with
your request.
Price lists, contact information, and order forms are available on the
Duplication Services Web site.

Medium:

Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to
fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room
to view the original item(s).   In some cases, a surrogate
(substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital
image, a copy print, or microfilm.
Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will
be visible on the left.)
Yes, the item is digitized.
Please use the digital image in preference to requesting
the original. All images can be viewed at a large size
when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.
In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available
when you are outside the Library of Congress because the
item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for
rights restrictions.
As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an
original item when a digital image is available.  If you
have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with
a reference librarian.  (Sometimes, the original is simply
too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic
negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also
easier to see online where they are presented as positive
images.)
No, the item is not digitized.
Please go to #2.
Do the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that
a non-digital surrogate exists, such as microfilm or copy prints?
Yes, another surrogate exists.
Reference staff can direct you to this surrogate.
No, another surrogate does not exist.
Please go to #3.
If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another
surrogate, please fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs
Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a
few minutes. Other materials require appointments for later the
same day or in the future.  Reference staff can advise you in
both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served.
To contact Reference staff in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room,
please use our Ask A Librarian service or
call the reading room between 8:30 and 5:00 at 202-707-6394, and Press 3.
