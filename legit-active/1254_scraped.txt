> Canal Tunnels
All London's canal tunnels are on the Regent's
Canal. Are there two, or three canal tunnels? Only two are generally
recognised today, Islington Tunnel (960 yards, or 886 metres) and Maida Hill
Tunnel (272 yards or 251 metres). In fact a third very short tunnel exists,
Eyre's tunnel, (53 yards or 48 metres) under Lisson Grove. Today this is
sometimes incorrectly assumed to be a bridge. Maida Hill and Eyre's tunnels were
opened in 1816 and are near to the junction with the Grand Junction Canal's
Paddington Arm which is now known as Little Venice. Islington Tunnel was opened
in 1820 along with the completion of the canal, a procession of boats passing
through with a band playing, to be met by a salute of cannon fire as they
emerged at the eastern end.
Islington Tunnel is the major engineering work of the Regent's
Canal. The engineer who built it was the Regent's Canal's engineer, James
Morgan. The early print illustrated to the left shows the east portal, before
completion of the canal. Notice that the decorative portal has yet to be built.  The
second photograph shows the west portal in 1998, at sunset. It is just possible to see the
light at the other end!
The Company
initially launched a competition for the design of the tunnel. The
advertisement was placed in August, 1812, but elucidated little response. A
committee of three eminent engineers, Nicholson, Walker, and Jessop, were to be
judges. They received only wild ideas and the prize of 100 guineas was awarded
to a copy of a Jessop design, which was evidently not considered suitable. The
competition having been something of a fiasco, James Morgan was ordered to get
on with it and so he did. There were delays in starting work as a result of the
usual difficulty - landowners! Work must have started in 1814 for in January
1815 four of the six shafts had been constructed and 140 yards of tunnel built.
By March 250 yards had been built and all four shafts were linked at
tunnel level. Tunnels were built by the process of sinking shafts at intervals
to the required depth, and then lowering men and equipment down to dig, and, it
was hoped, meet. Accurate survey work was essential in order to locate the
shafts in the correct place and dig them to the correct depth. That the tunnel
is more or less straight indicates that this was done well, although
difficulties meant that headings, small pilot bores, had to be constructed
between shafts initially to ensure it. Things did not progress quite so well
later in the project however, and Morgan found the earth through which he was
digging to be a lot less stable than had been anticipated. A vein of stone
caused ingress of water.
Mindful as he doubtless was of the collapse of a road tunnel at
Highgate in north London, Morgan used substantial temporary support structures
and used stronger brickwork and in places additional brick lining to add
strength. Springs were encountered in the digging of the shafts which made
extra work necessary. The tunnel cost nearly Â£40,000 to build, a great
deal more than had been anticipated. This was hardly unusual, and indeed even
today major civil engineering projects frequently end up costing much more than
expected! The tunnel was completed at the end of 1818 although not opened for
business straight away. The picture (above, right) is of the east portal
of the tunnel in 1999.
The tunnel was at first operated by "legging", whereby men lying on
their backs on planks aboard the boat walked the vessel through against the
side walls. This was slow, hard, and caused a great deal of delay. In 1826 a
steam chain tug was introduced, one of the earliest uses of steam power on the
canals. On one
occasion in 1880 it caught fire and sank.The
picture to the right shows the tug in 1924 (from the film Barging Through
London) The chain was secured at each end of the tunnel and the tug pulled
itself and a train of barges by winding the chain around a barrel on board.
This means of haulage survived over 100 years until the 1930s when boats with
engines became commonplace. The caption from the film (above, left) makes clear
the conditions in which the boat and tug crews had to work!.

During the winter period at the start of 2000,
Islington Tunnel was closed for extensive repairs (pictured, left). In June
1818 Thomas Telford inspected the tunnel and is quoted as describing it as
"Perfect, the materials and workmanship excellent, and its direction perfectly
straight". It has lasted more than two centuries, so far!
Maida Hill Tunnel was the first to be built, starting in 1812. A
spring was struck during the construction resulting in some casualties amongst
the workmen and a substantial delay. A great many wooden supports were needed
to shore up the tunnel but these difficulties were eventually overcome. The
route of the tunnel had to be altered and its length because of opposition from
a Mr Portman. This diversion also made necessary the small Eyre's tunnel under
what is now Lisson Grove
Maida Hill Tunnel from the west. A restaurant overlooks the
tunnel mouth, giving luncheon customers a first rate view of the frequently
passing trip boats, in summer.
Maida Hill Tunnel east portal. The portal is disfigured by the
ugly design of the housing for electricity supply cables, which are routed under
the towpath.

Eyre's Tunnel from the west.The short Eyre's tunnel is the only one with a towpath, now
fenced. A building is situted above this portal. The main urban road Lisson Grove passes over the
canal above the tunnel.
