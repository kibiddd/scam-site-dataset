Unwritten Law Lyrics
"Save Me"
Had a bad day, don't talk to me
Gonna ride this out
My little black heart, breaks apart
With your big mouth
And I'm sick of my sickness
Don't touch me, you'll get this
I'm useless, lazy
Perverted, and you hate me
You can't save me
You can't change me
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call
And everything, everything's my fault
Went to the doctor and I asked her
To make this stop (Whoa)
Got medication, a new addiction
Fucking thanks a lot (Whoa)
Had to relapse, I'm bad at rehabs
It ruins everything (Whoa)
So point your finger at the singer
He's in the pharmacy
You can't save me
You can't change me
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call
And everything's my fault
You can't save me
You can't blame me
Well I'm waiting here to take the fall
And everything, everything's my fault
And I'm a death threat
Haven't slept yet
Baby why the wake up call
I'm the bad boy
Tell the tabloids
Everything's my fault
Whoa whoa whoa
Yeah, write it write it
Whoa whoa whoa
Everything's my fault
Everything's my fault
I went to heaven, but couldn't get in
For what I have done
I said please take me, they said you're crazy
You had too much fun
You can't save me
You can't change me
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call
Everything's my fault
You can't save me
You can't blame me
Well I'm waiting here to take the fall
Everything, everything's my fault
You can't save me
You can't change me (Everything's my fault)
You can't save me
You can't change me (Everything's my fault)
You can't save me
You can't change me (Everything's my fault)
You can't save me
You can't change me
Everything's my fault

Social Distortion - "Story Of My Life" High school seemed like such a blur,
I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections.
And in class I dreamed all day,
Of a rock 'n' roll weekend
And the girl in the front of the room,...
Stroke 9 - "Little Black Backpack" I know it
It's a shame
A shame I can't show it
And I see it
I can see it now
But I'm so far below it
Don't wanna
Don't wanna talk about it
I say why not?
Don't wanna think about it
I say...
Alien Ant Farm - "Homage" Ten somersets will undertake on solid ground
The Beatles were my thing Supertramp Jackson Browne
Maybe I threw on The Police or ELO to take me home
And every time I listened to The Pixies with you...
Alkaline Trio - "Calling All Skeletons" Here it is again, yet it stings like the first time
Seems it never ends, double nickels on your dime
I thought we were friends, I guess it just depends who you ask
These feelings tend to leave me...
The All-American Rejects - "Move Along" Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant...
