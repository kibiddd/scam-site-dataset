Oakland, CA
Welcome to Oakland, California, aka, the Bright Side of the Bay. The city is the central shipping port for the greater San Francisco Bay Area region known as the East Bay, and is the United States' fifth-busiest port. Oakland is the eighth-largest city in the state with more than 400,000 residents who speak 100 languages and dialects making it home to one of the most ethnically blended cities in the nation.
O-town shines bright with a Mediterranean climate that offers over 300 sunny days a year, often spent on the city's treasured crown jewel, Lake Merritt. The lake was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge, and its picturesque waterfront is the central heartbeat to the city's thriving downtown urban landscape. Hillside neighborhoods dotted with historic architecture, skirted by a coveted 19 miles of shoreline along the San Francisco Bay create the ideal setting for more parks and green space than any other city in the Bay Area.
Oakland's golden weather is certain to the outdoor enthusiasts of all interest; however, equally sunny is a city beaming with the hottest sports and cultural attractions. Residents and tourists alike enjoy hanging out at the Oakland Coliseum to see two professional sports, the Oakland Raiders of the NFL and the Golden State Warriors of the NBA; watching performing arts produced by the Oakland Ballet and the Oakland Lyric Opera; and visiting museums such as the Oakland Museum of California and top attractions like the Oakland Zoo, USS Potomac and Preservation Park.
Come explore a city steeped in diversity, offering a blend of historical and modern charm, and home to a spirited community shining bright across the bay.
