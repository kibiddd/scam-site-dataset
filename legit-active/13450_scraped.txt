World Championship Wrestling
World Championship Wrestling, Inc. (WCW) was an American professional wrestling promotion company based in Atlanta, Georgia. It began as a regional (mid-Atlantic U.S.), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)-affiliated "territory" promotion – Jim Crockett Promotions – until November 1988, when Ted Turner (through his Turner Broadcasting System business) bought the promotion, whose struggle to compete with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) had left it near bankruptcy. Immediately after the buyout, the promotion was renamed the Universal Wrestling Corporation (UWC) and consisted of Crockett's business assets; however, it was soon renamed again: World Championship Wrestling (the title of the promotion's weekly TV series, which had aired on TBS for many years prior).
In the mid-1990s, WCW dramatically improved its economic performance, largely due to the promotion of Eric Bischoff to Executive Producer (to guide the overall direction of the on-screen product); the strategy of quickly hiring former WWF main eventers who often brought large fanbases with them; the introduction of the Monday Nitro series on cable TV, and the resultant Monday Night Wars with the WWF's Monday Night Raw; the successful creative and marketing execution of the New World Order (nWo) brand/stable of wrestlers; and other innovative concepts. WCW also had a popular and successful cruiserweight division (an acrobatic, faster-paced, lucha libre-inspired style of wrestling).

WCW Saturday Night
WCW Saturday Night was a weekly Saturday night TV show on TBS produced by World Championship Wrestling. The program existed through various incarnations under different names before becoming WCW Saturday Night in 1992.  Although initially the anchor show of the Ted Turner-backed wrestling company, the September 1995 premiere of WCW Monday Nitro airing on sister station Turner Network Television usurped the show's once preeminent position in the company, as the primary source of storyline development and pay-per-view buildup.
The show's place in the company was further devalued by the advent of WCW Thunder in 1998, airing on TBS and providing the secondary wrestling and storyline development that WCW Saturday Night had produced in the wake of Nitro's burgeoning three-hour-long format.  Once the cornerstone of the WCW wrestling empire, WCW Saturday Night ended its run in 2000 as the company struggled creatively to meet the demands of producing over six hours of new broadcast material on a weekly basis. The rights to WCW Saturday Night now belong to WWE as a result of that company's 2001 purchase of selected assets of WCW (including its video library).

WCW Wrestling
WCW Wrestling (a.k.a. World Championship Wrestling) is a wrestling video game that was released in April 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Japanese version was released in 1989 under the name Super Star Pro Wrestling, with a different lineup of wrestlers.
It was the first (and, to date, only) video game based on the National Wrestling Alliance (at the time, WCW was a member of NWA). After The Road Warriors left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation, WCW continued to advertise the game in their own catalogs with a mock-up cartridge showing Sting on the label, though no such copies of the game with an alternate label are known to exist or believed to have ever been manufactured. To date, the game has sold over 100,000 copies.
Gameplay
Each wrestler in WCW Wrestling has eight "selectable" moves, two Irish whip moves, and a finisher.
Selectable moveset
WCW Wrestling differs from most wrestling titles in that the player selects his or her moveset prior to the match. Each wrestler has a menu of eight moves (with each wrestler featuring a unique moveset), of which the player may choose four (each move selected is assigned to a direction on the D-pad).

1895 World Championship (football)
The 1895 World Championship was an exhibition football match that took place at Tynecastle Park on 27 April 1895 between the winner of the English Football League First Division, Sunderland, and Scottish League First Division, Heart of Midlothian. The match was won by Sunderland who beat Heart of Midlothian 5–3.
The game was not the first "World Championship" game between English and Scottish sides; however, it was the first such club competition won by an English team, with previous winners being Hibernian and Renton (both Scottish Cup winners, as the leagues had not been yet created at the time). The Scottish and English leagues were pre-eminent in the world at that time, with the only league outside the UK being in Argentina.

There are all here: the the Sleeper hold, the Atomic Drop, Mario Milano, the golden Greek Spiros Arion, Brute Bernard, Tojo, Waldo Von Erick, Skull Murphy, Big Bad John, Killer Karl Cox, Larry O'Dea, Playboy Gary Hart and many more all brought to life by the best commentator of his era, Jack Little. Who else could say "and they've just thrown the referee out of the ring," and make it sound like a minor detail? Co-starring in this 56minutes of Festival Hall nostalgia were the packed house crowd. If you were one of the kids beating the canvas like a madman on the edge of the ring tell us your memories?

There are all here: the the Sleeper hold, the Atomic Drop, Mario Milano, the golden Greek Spiros Arion, Brute Bernard, Tojo, Waldo Von Erick, Skull Murphy, Big Bad John, Killer Karl Cox, Larry O'Dea, Playboy Gary Hart and many more all brought to life by the best commentator of his era, Jack Little. Who else could say "and they've just thrown the referee out of the ring," and make it sound like a minor detail? Co-starring in this 56minutes of Festival Hall nostalgia were the packed house crowd. If you were one of the kids beating the canvas like a madman on the edge of the ring tell us your memories?
For those of us who grew up with four channels or black and white TV in Melbourne, Sunday lunchtime TV was a special time. Wedged in between the DLP's Bob Sanataria's 'Point of View' and the badly dubbed weekly Spaghetti gladiator movies of 'Epic Theatre' World Championship Wrestling was an imbedded part of our 1960s TV ritual. In the days when you had to walk to the TV to change channels switching between Ron Casey's World of Sport and Jack Little's theatrics was a habit. Political correctness was a foreign concept, every race had its villains in this theatre.
I must acknowledge the great camera work of Geoff Kilbourn, 'Killer' was a Melbourne TV original, I think he began when TV did in 1956. All the camera work on this tape is his.
RIP Mario Milano.

World Championship Wrestling
World Championship Wrestling, Inc. (WCW) was an American professional wrestling promotion company based in Atlanta, Georgia. It began as a regional (mid-Atlantic U.S.), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)-affiliated "territory" promotion – Jim Crockett Promotions – until November 1988, when Ted Turner (through his Turner Broadcasting System business) bought the promotion, whose struggle to compete with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) had left it near bankruptcy. Immediately after the buyout, the promotion was renamed the Universal Wrestling Corporation (UWC) and consisted of Crockett's business assets; however, it was soon renamed again: World Championship Wrestling (the title of the promotion's weekly TV series, which had aired on TBS for many years prior).
In the mid-1990s, WCW dramatically improved its economic performance, largely due to the promotion of Eric Bischoff to Executive Producer (to guide the overall direction of the on-screen product); the strategy of quickly hiring former WWF main eventers who often brought large fanbases with them; the introduction of the Monday Nitro series on cable TV, and the resultant Monday Night Wars with the WWF's Monday Night Raw; the successful creative and marketing execution of the New World Order (nWo) brand/stable of wrestlers; and other innovative concepts. WCW also had a popular and successful cruiserweight division (an acrobatic, faster-paced, lucha libre-inspired style of wrestling).
