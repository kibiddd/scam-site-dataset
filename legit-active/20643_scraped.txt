My act could be classified as 'unedited,' but I try to keep my audience in mind while focusing on the truth. I never want to compromise my act just to get a laugh.The comics I hate are thieves. Nothing's more disgusting than a guy who
steals another person's ideas and tries to claim them as his own.
Stand-up comedy is supposed to be "Here's the world through my eyes."
It's supposed to be your observations, your thoughts and views on life.
When you snatch little pieces of other people's lives and try to palm
them off as your own, that's more disgusting than anything. Robin
Williams is a huge thief. Denis Leary is a huge thief. His whole
stand-up career is based on Bill Hicks, a brilliant guy who died years
ago.Mixed martial arts is sort of a testing ground. There was a lot of fuckery before - a lot of shit that people thought was good but was useless. And there were a lot of people that were pretending they were doing some high-level ancient martial arts that were deadly and super-effective. But really, they were just like cult leaders and charlatans. Crazy people.
