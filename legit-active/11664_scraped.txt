son Michael 'Krushchev' behind his back because of his harsh bearing
and unforgiving ways." The Duke told his third wife, Pilar Wayne, that
Michael had never gotten over his abandonment of Michael's mother
Josie, his first wife.Quotes"I produced McLintock! (1963) when I was 25 years old. I don't think if I wasn't
John Wayne's son, I would have had that opportunity. It wasn't all smooth,
working with my father; there were a lot of bumps along the way, both
for him and me, but I wish he were still around so we could get in
arguments".FAQ11Powered by AlexaWhen did Michael Wayne die?How did Michael Wayne die?How old was Michael Wayne when he died?Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentLearn more about contributingEdit page
