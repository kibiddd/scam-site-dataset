Hi, I will visit KC next week and am looking for the best shopping area. Actually I am looking for the outlet that has many shops for kids, so that I can buy off-priced items...
I found Zona Rosa and Legends at village west, oak part mall..
which one will fit in my searching criteria?
Would you please give me some advice...
I will stay in Downtown KC with a kid and rent a car..

Zona Rosa and Legends are both trendy new shopping districts, full of glitz and shops geared toward the yuppie lifestyle. Both are exciting places to visit. Oak Park Mall is one of the nicest traditional malls in Kansas City/Overland Park. It is kept very clean and modern. No vacant shops like you are beginning to see at other malls. Of the three you mentioned none are outlet or discount related.
The only "true" outlet shopping in the KC area is the mall of the Great Mall of the Great Plains. Here is a very informative article concerning it on about.com http://kansascity.about.com/od/shopping/p/GreatMall.htm
It is not truely in KC. It is just southwest of the city in Olathe, KS. If you were going to visit this mall you could also check out Legends/Nebraska Furniture Mart/Cabelas on the way. All of these are on the Kansas side of the City.
I don't want to take anything away from Zona Rosa/Legends, we love visiting both. However, neither meets the criteria you mentioned. Happy Shopping!

Hmmmm..... I was commenting on the 3 you mentioned, maybe you missed reading my first paragraph where I said "Of the three you mentioned none are outlet or discount related."
The ONLY discount mall in the area I am aware of is The Great Mall of the Great Plains. And it does fully fit the criteria you described. It is as discount as you can get for KC.

Please don't go to the Great Mall.
Despite what the other poster has claimed, the Legends at Village West does have some factory/outlet stores, including Gap/Gap Kids, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, and Brooks Brothers. It's not a true "outlet mall," but that's a good thing, in my opinion. There's also a fairly new kid-oriented restaurant there called T-Rex; from the outside, it looks like it would be fun for any kid.
Unfortunately, none of the options is close to downtown KCMO, but each is within a 15-25 min. ride in good traffic.

I agree the Great Mall, as it is named, is no longer so great. But as far as discount malls, it is the only one advertised as such. IMHO the few places at Legends using the word discount, are greatly expanding on the definition of discount.
If you want to shop somewhere fun and exciting, go to Legends.

The Great Mall is more of a waste of space than a mall. At one time they had a few great outlet shops, but even then it was not worth the trip.
Legends has the best selection of outlet stores. Zona Rosa seems to be more of the usual, just an outdoor mall. I think that Legends may be a bit closer to downtown also as you can just zip over on I-70.
Now - Oak Park Mall may be a proper mall, but they do have an excellent selection of shops and while they are not outlet shops, they will most likely have sale items. I grew up in KC, but now live out of state and make sure to shop at Legends everytime I go home. The Banana, Gap, BCBG Girls, BCBG Max Aria, Ann Taylor, etc. stores are fantastic. And if you have a little one with you, there are plenty of outdoor fountains to play in or restaurants targeted towards the little ones, while the older kids go shopping.
