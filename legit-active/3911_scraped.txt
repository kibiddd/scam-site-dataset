A2 motorway (Slovenia)
The A2 motorway (Slovene: avtocesta A2) is a motorway in Slovenia, around 175 km long, connecting the Karavanke Tunnel (at the Austrian border) via the capital city Ljubljana to Obrežje (at the Croatian border, near Zagreb). It connects several major Slovene cities, including Kranj, Ljubljana, and Novo Mesto, and is part of Pan-European Corridor X.
The route of the motorway largely follows the path of the Brotherhood and Unity Highway, which was a two-lane non-divided road constructed as the main traffic artery within Yugoslavia. With the construction of the divided motorway, most of the previous road was demolished. A notable exception can be seen on the southern A2 segment between Grosuplje and Višnja Gora, where the previous road was grandfathered into the motorway system; it lacks a hard shoulder and has sharp turns and an exit ramp with a 10% grade. The northern segment between Višnja Gora and Grosuplje follows a completely different path, with three traffic lanes and a relatively lower grade.

A2 motorway (Cyprus)
The A2 motorway in Cyprus is a road which branches off the A1 at Pera Chorio-Nisou and connects to the A3. It is referred to locally as the Nicosia - Larnaca motorway (Greek: Αυτοκινητόδρομος Λευκωσίας - Λάρνακας, Turkish: Lefkoşa - Larnaka yolu). It is also called "the tube" because it is mostly straight with a very limited number of exits. Two of its 6 junctions are limited access to facilitate access to Athienou.
At the Rizoelia Junction, space has been made to construct a flyover from the A2 to the BS, as clearly seen on Google maps.

A2 motorway (Netherlands)
The A2 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands. It is one of the busiest highways in the Netherlands. The road connects the city of Amsterdam, near the interchange Amstel, with the Belgian border, near Maastricht (NL) and Liège (B), and the Belgian road A25.
The route of the A2 motorway is shared with two major European routes. Between its start, at the Interchange Amstel near Amsterdam, and the Interchange Oudenrijn near Utrecht, the E35 follows the A2 motorway. From the Interchange Oudenrijn towards the Belgian border just south of Maastricht, the European route E25 follows the route of the A2. The local and express lane on A2 has different speed limit. The speed limit on express lane is 120 km/h (75 mph) and local is 100 km/h (63 mph).
Road N2
Currently, the motorway A2 is interrupted at one location, near Maastricht. This section is being referred to as N2, to make a distinction between the motorway (A2) and the non-motorway (N2).

Coordinates: 46°07′N 14°49′E﻿ / ﻿46.117°N 14.817°E﻿ / 46.117; 14.817
Slovenia (i/sloʊˈviːniə, slə-, -njə/sloh-VEE-nee-ə; Slovene: Slovenija [slɔˈʋéːnija]), officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene:  Republika Slovenija ,abbr.: RS), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers 20,273 square kilometers (7,827 sq mi) and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO.The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.
The territory is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate, with the exception of the Slovene Littoral that has a sub-Mediterranean climate and the north-western area that has an Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the territory is covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven.

Slovenian wine
Slovenian wine is wine from Slovenia. Viticulture and winemaking has existed in this region since the time of the Celts and Illyrians tribes, long before the Romans would introduce winemaking to the lands of France, Spain and Germany.
Today Slovenia has more than 28,000 wineries making between 80 and 90 million litres annually from the country's 22,300 ha of vineyards. About 75% of the country's production is white wine. Almost all of the wine is consumed domestically with only 6.1 million l a year being exported—mostly to the United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and lately the Czech Republic. Most of the country's wine production falls under the classification of premium (vrhunsko) wine with less than 30% classified as basic table wine (namizno vino). Slovenia has three principal wine regions: the Drava Valley, Lower Sava Valley and Slovenian Littoral.
History
Unlike many of the major European wine regions, Slovenia's viticultural history predates Roman influences and can be traced back to the early Celtic and Illyrian tribes who began cultivating vines for wine production sometime between the 5th and 4th centuries BC. By the Middle Ages, the Christian Church controlled most of the region's wine production through the monasteries. Under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, privately owned wineries had some presence in the region but steady declined following the empire's fall and the beginning of Yugoslavia. By the end of the Second World War, co-operatives controlled nearly all of the region's wine production and quality was very low as the emphasis was on the bulk wine production. The exception was the few small private wineries in the Drava Valley region that were able to continue operation.

[4KHDR] Driving in Slovenia: Avtocesta A2 E61 from Jesenice to Ljubljana
In this video you can drive along on the Avtocesta A2 E61 from Jesenice to Ljubljana in Slovenia. The A2 motorway runs from the border with Austria in the North to the border with Croatia in the South. In the heart of the country it passes the capital of Slovenia: Ljubljana.
Not all parts of the A2 have a proper motorway design. As you can see, some of the parts near Jesenice / Bled don't have a shoulder and therefore a lower speed limit (110 km/h). The parts with a shoulder usually have a 130 km/h speed limit.

In this video you can drive along on the Avtocesta A2 E61 from Jesenice to Ljubljana in Slovenia. The A2 motorway runs from the border with Austria in the North to the border with Croatia in the South. In the heart of the country it passes the capital of Slovenia: Ljubljana.
Not all parts of the A2 have a proper motorway design. As you can see, some of the parts near Jesenice / Bled don't have a shoulder and therefore a lower speed limit (110 km/h). The parts with a shoulder usually have a 130 km/h speed limit.

The 4K road tourism video features a nice drive through Slovenia, from the capital and main city in the country, Ljubljana to the mountains, until the border tunnel of Karavank. The motorway is nice to drive, as it traverses a hilly landscape, following The Sava River uphill, offering nice views to The Julian and Karavank Alps in front of us. There are some nice to visit places on the way, like Kranj, Radovljica and Bled. Photos from Bled are also integrated in the video. Enjoy!

A drive on the beltway of Ljubljana, Slovenia, which is about 26 kilometers long. Coming from the northeast (A1) heading onto H3, the northern beltline, then A2 west and south of the city, and A1 north again.
Ljubljana is the capital of Slovenia and has about 280,000 inhabitants. The name "Ljubljana" is pronounced like "Jubjana", with barely an "l" in it.

A2 motorway (Slovenia)
The A2 motorway (Slovene: avtocesta A2) is a motorway in Slovenia, around 175 km long, connecting the Karavanke Tunnel (at the Austrian border) via the capital city Ljubljana to Obrežje (at the Croatian border, near Zagreb). It connects several major Slovene cities, including Kranj, Ljubljana, and Novo Mesto, and is part of Pan-European Corridor X.
The route of the motorway largely follows the path of the Brotherhood and Unity Highway, which was a two-lane non-divided road constructed as the main traffic artery within Yugoslavia. With the construction of the divided motorway, most of the previous road was demolished. A notable exception can be seen on the southern A2 segment between Grosuplje and Višnja Gora, where the previous road was grandfathered into the motorway system; it lacks a hard shoulder and has sharp turns and an exit ramp with a 10% grade. The northern segment between Višnja Gora and Grosuplje follows a completely different path, with three traffic lanes and a relatively lower grade.
