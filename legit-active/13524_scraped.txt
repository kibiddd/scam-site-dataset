Alice In Chains - Dirt Lyrics
Artist: Alice In Chains
Album: Dirt
Genre: Rock
Heyo! SONGLYRICS just got interactive. Highlight. Review: RIFF-it.  RIFF-it good.
Listen while you read!
I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self control
I want you to kill me and dig me under
I wanna live no more
One who doesn't care
Is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself
From what is wrong for me, for me
I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me
One who doesn't care
Is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself
From what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care
Is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself
From what is wrong for me, for me
Yeah, yeah
You, you are so special
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
You, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt
One who doesn't care
Is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself
From what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care
Is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself
From what is wrong for me, yeah
