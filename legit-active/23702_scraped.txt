The Kaiser Papers Archives
If you found your way here you were probably looking for The Kaiser Papers — the original Kaiser Permanente critical website, online since the year 2000. We are not affiliated with the folks at The Kaiser Papers, but many of the horror stories we have written about or linked to over the years were originally… Read More »

Kaiser Black Ops
We are not so sure anymore that Kaiser Permanente wasn’t responsible for the original hacking that brought us back to update the website. We didn’t initially think so because of the way the hackers got in, and we do know how. Most hacking is random exploitation of vulnerabilities, so the first one was on us,… Read More »

Site redesign and seeking volunteers
If things look different around here that is because we are in the midst of a much needed redesign. The changes will be extensive so we are working on a development site until everything is operating as we like, and as of this writing the current design is just a temporary intermediate step. We agree… Read More »

New Kaiser Thrive ad parody and why we exist
Among the most frequently asked questions we receive are “Who are you?” and “What are your goals?” Kaiser Permanente Thrive Exposed was started in 2004 as an anti-brand campaign, to counter KP’s deceptive attempt to rehabilitate its reputation with $40 million+ per year in member money, in the form of Thrive. We didn’t know anyone… Read More »

One off stories by crazy folk
Oh Yay! Our first hate mail since we returned! And we were afraid we wouldn’t get noticed again after so much time away. Fortunately we keep really detailed logs so we can see quite a bit about the people who think it’s a worthy use of their time to do these nasty things. For the… Read More »

Greetings humble followers! After an extended absence We Are Back. We had to take a break to deal with some health problems of our own, but the website was hacked recently and that forced us to update.

Proof that Kaiser is dumping psychiatric patients on the taxpayers
Another day another class action lawsuit: Kaiser Permanente Insurance Co. was hit with a class action lawsuit in California on Tuesday, alleging the company of strong-arming the most disabled psychiatric patients into canceling their plans with the large insurance provider. Plaintiffs Douglass Kerr and Matthew Szitzkar-Kerr allege in their class action lawsuit that psychiatric patients… Read More »

Union sues to block Kaiser from Covered California exchange
Received this press release yesterday, which we are reprinting in full below. NUHW is quickly becoming our favorite union. It is the same organization that crafted the complaint which recently resulted in a $4 million fine against KP for violating California mental health care laws. The link in the first paragraph takes you to a… Read More »

$4.9 million awarded in brain injury case
Highly recommended reading for everyone with an interest in how Kaiser’s rigged arbitration system works to keep its many misdeeds out of the public eye. It is rare for KP to lose in arbitration, but when they do, as in this case, “Kaiser offered to fund an annuity with the arbitration award, but only if… Read More »
