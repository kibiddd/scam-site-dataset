After a disastrous test screening of a four-hour version of the film, distribution interest dried up. The film was eventually pared down to less than two hours and released in theaters.GoofsWhen the sheriff enters the basement we can see he leaves the door open. When it cuts to wide shots we can see in both wide shots that the door is closed. Then it appears open again later.QuotesRex: Go fuck yourself, Matt, because she isn't going to.Crazy creditsThe production logos have a fuzzy quality to them, like we're seeing footage through a webcam. The five housemates are shown over the end credits.ConnectionsFeatured in The Ryan Hollinger Show: Pulse & Feardotcom: The Rise of "Internet Horror" (2020)SoundtracksFuck the Pain AwayPerformed by PeachesUser reviews213ReviewFeatured reviewMissed opportunityThis film was billed as a completely new for the genre.  Its not.Initially it starts out as a fairly edgy psycological suspense movie - focusing on the characters current paranoia and past skeletons.  Had it continued in this vein things may have shaped up into something genuinely scary.However, about a third of the way through, the plot is pretty much revealed (or can be guessed at) and the movie descends into a poorly paced slasher formula - except this time in a Reality TV House (which is incidently the plot of the new Halloween movie - previewed before this one starts!!).The web-cam perspective adds something - but at the same time borrows heavily from Blair Witch and the end scenes from Silence of the Lambs - both of which were done better.4/10 missed opportunity.daniel-bovenziOct 6, 2002PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ18How long is My Little Eye?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 4, 2002 (United Kingdom)Countries of originUnited KingdomUnited StatesFranceCanadaLanguageEnglishAlso known asCircuito cerradoFilming locationsClementsport, Nova Scotia, CanadaProduction companiesUniversal PicturesStudioCanalWorking Title FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget£2,000,000 (estimated)Gross worldwide$6,753,562See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 35 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the French language plot outline for My Little Eye (2002)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
