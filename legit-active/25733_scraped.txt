Amtrak also holds sales and promotions throughout the year, with discounted fares to/from Virginia stations. Follow Amtrak Virginia on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for sale announcements, promotions, contests and more.
Pets on Board
Amtrak welcomes small dogs or cats (up to 20 pounds) for trips of up to seven hours on most routes (some restrictions apply*). You can bring your furry four-legged travel buddy for just $25 or 800 Amtrak Guest Rewards points. Visit Amtrak’s website to learn more.
Bring Your Bike
Ride the rails, then ride your bicycle once you reach your scenic Virginia destination! Amtrak offers a number of services to transport your bike onboard. The options vary based on your train, route and stations.
Between May and October 2018, cyclists taking advantage of the scenic Virginia Capital Trail don’t have to commit to a 100-mile round-trip. You can participate in a pilot program to board your bicycle and take the train in one direction between Richmond’s Main Street Station (RVM) and Williamsburg (WBG). Just make an advance reservation online, booking a one-way ticket, and pay a $20 fee. Each train can accommodate 12 bicycles, so customers need to be certain they see the bicycle add-on option that appears during the booking process when space is available. The following trains participate in the pilot program.
Friday/Saturday: train 65 departs Main Street Station at 9:34 a.m. and arrives in Williamsburg at 10:38 a.m.
Sunday-Thursday: train 67 departs Main Street Station at 10:10 a.m. and arrives in Williamsburg at 11:14 a.m.
Daily: train 66 departs Williamsburg at 5:41 p.m. and arrives at Richmond Main Street Station at 6:30 p.m.
Visit Amtrak’s website to learn about other opportunities to bring bikes aboard.
For immediate attention concerning an existing reservation, call a service representative at 1-800-USA-RAIL or TDD/TTY 1-800-523-6590.
