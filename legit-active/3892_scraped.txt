Individually, they're Devon Allman and Duane Betts, two solo artists and modern-day guitar heroes who've both spent years creating their own version of American roots music. Together, they're the leaders of The Allman Betts Band, a supergroup anchored by sharp songwriting, fiery fretwork, and an historic legacy. Inspired by the classic sounds of the group's family tree, The Allman Betts Band makes timeless rock & roll for the modern world, blurring the boundaries between blues, Americana, and southern soul. Critically-acclaimed studio albums like Down to the River and Bless Your Heart have established the band's own legacy of music and brotherhood, while hundreds of live shows â including annual performances of the all-star Allman Betts Family Revival â have sharpened the group's chemistry onstage. There's a richly historic lineage to The Allman Betts Band, but these musicians proudly live in the modern world, carving out a contemporary soundtrack for the American South.

The Missoula Children's Theatre takes pride in presenting TREASURE ISLAND, an original adaptation of Robert Louis Stevensonâs epic novel. Young Jim Hawkins, a mischievous lad, lives with his Mother and six Sisters in a seaside village on the coast of Maine. The year is 1782 and the American War for Revolution is in its last days. Longing for adventure, Jim comes under the hypnotic spell of the legendary pirate, Long John Silver. While waiting tables in the family Inn, Jim finds a treasure map and, with the villainous Silver as his seeming mentor, sails uncharted seas with only the ragged map and a flock of Gulls as guides. Always up for adventure, Jimâs Ruffian friends say farewell to their Mariner parents and serve as cabin boys for Silver and his band of hilarious (although unsavory) Pirate types. Once on the island, nights are sleepless as true colors are revealed in our heroâs quest for the proverbial happy ending. Then - at last - the treasure is found and hand in hand weâre homeward bound.
