Edward Tufte is the revelatory retina of our time, ever connecting eye and brain in enlightening new ways. He creates masterpieces about design that are themselves masterpieces of design. Seeing with Fresh Eyes: Meaning, Space, Data, Truth takes all that he knows into a yet deeper level of wisdom and wider realm of inquiry. A completely delicious work.’ Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog Order Book Now from Graphics Press
