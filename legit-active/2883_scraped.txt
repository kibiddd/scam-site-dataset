Americans (Montreal 1865-67), by J. Fennings Taylor, who was deputy clerk of the old legislative council, and later of
the senate of Canada,
and a contemporary of the eminent men whose careers he briefly and graphically describes. Consult also Dent's

Gallery, which has numerous portraits.

[8:
These concluding words of Lord Elgin recall a similar expression of
feeling by Sir Etienne Pascal Tache, "That the last gun that would be
fired for British supremacy in America would be fired by a French
Canadian."]
[9: Fifty years after these words were written,
debates have taken place in the House of Commons of the Canadian
federation in favour of an imperial Zollverein, which would give
preferential treatment to Canada's products in British markets. The
Conservative party, when led by Sir Charles Tupper, emphatically
declared that "no measure of preference, which falls short of the
complete realization of such a policy, should be considered final or
satisfactory." England, however, still clings to free trade.]

lawyer, who occupied for many years a notable place in Canadian
politics, and is now (1902) a member of the British House of Commons.]

[12: "I am inclined," wrote Lord Durham, "to view
the insurrectionary movements which did take place as indicative of
no deep-rooted disaffection, and to believe that almost the entire
body of the reformers of this province sought only by constitutional
means to attain those objects for which they had so long peaceably
struggled before the unhappy troubles occasioned by the violence of a
few unprincipled adventurers and heated enthusiasts."]

Bourinot's "Parliamentary Procedure," p. 573_n_. The last occasion on
which a Canadian speaker exercised this old privilege was in 1869,
and then Mr. Cockburn made only a very brief reference to the
measures of the session.]
[15: It was not until 1874 when Mr.
Alexander Mackenzie was first minister of a Liberal government that
simultaneous polling at a general election was required by law, but
it had existed some years previously in Nova Scotia.]
[16: See
"The Last Forty Years, or Canada Since the Union of 1841," by John
Charles Dent, Toronto, 1881, vol. II., p. 309. Mr. White became
Minister of the Interior in Sir John Macdonald's government (1885-88)
but died suddenly in the midst of a most active and useful
administrative career.]
[17: See remarks of Dr. Kingsford in his
"History of Canada" (vol. VII., pp. 266-273), showing how unjust was
the clamour raised by the enemies of the church in New England when a
movement was in progress for the establishment of a colonial
episcopate simply for purposes of ordination and church government.]
[18: A clause of the act of 1791 provided that the sovereign might,
if he thought fit, annex hereditary titles of honour to the right of
being summoned to the legislative council in either province, but no
titles were ever conferred under the authority of this imperial
statute.]
[19: Thirteen other patents were left unsigned by the
lieutenant-governor and consequently had no legal force.]
