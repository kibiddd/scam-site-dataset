View here   Dunlin, Mike Peters The Central Valley Joint Venture What we doGuided by a 20-member management board, the Central Valley Joint Venture (CVJV) uses the best available science to set bird population and habitat objectives that are aligned with several national and international bird conservation plans, which focus voluntary conservation in the Central Valley. The CVJV also provides practical information and guidance for improving bird habitat to policymakers, state and federal agencies, private landowners, local governments, conservation organizations, and corporations. Additionally, the CVJV helps strategically leverage and increase investments in bird habitats on public and private lands in the Central Valley to support healthy wild bird populations, benefiting local communities.   We bring science to conservation policy, programs, and implementation.   We foster working partnerships among public and private landowners to maximize the benefits for communities as well as the wildlife.   We support landscape-scale conservation.   We connect people with the outdoors.   Discover more   Central Valley Why is it so ImportantOnce a vast mosaic of wetlands, floodplain forests, grasslands, oak woodlands, and saltbush scrub, California’s Central Valley provided vital habitat for millions of migrating and resident birds of the Pacific Flyway. Today, only 5 percent of the Valley’s native wetlands and forested riversides remains in a somewhat natural state. It's estimated that over a 100 million birds of approximately 400 species still depend on the Central Valley for their survival.

Water creates the well-recognized flooded ponds and moist, marshy soils that characterize wetlands everywhere.In the Central Valley, wetland-dependent bird habitat is almost entirely “managed,” either as semi-permanent or seasonal wetlands, or on flooded agricultural lands that provide a wetland habitat function.Ensuring reliable and affordable water supplies for wetland habitat management may be our greatest challenge.    Learn More   Central Valley Joint Venture Our MissionPartnering to conserve Central Valley birds and their habitats for current and future generations.   Discover more   Central Valley Joint Venture How we workThe CVJV cultivates and supports partnerships that protect and restore habitat for the benefit of birds, other wildlife, and people. We provide partners with critical scientific, human dimensions, technical, and policy guidance and support to plan and carry out the most effective on-the-ground bird habitat conservation efforts.    Discover more   Our Foundation ScienceThe CVJV applies the best available science to develop our conservation objectives. We pull together local and national scientists who, using data from the region, employ established methods and models to determine the habitat required for thriving populations of birds in the Central Valley today and into the future.
