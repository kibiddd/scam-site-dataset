Tranmere Rovers v Walsall F.C.
Event Date: 08/01/2011
Saturday 8 January 2011, sees Tranmere Rovers play host to Walsall F.C. at Prenton Park.
A win for Rovers this afternoon could take them as high as 16th, though that is very much dependent on the shift in goal difference with Rochdale and Carlisle.
New signings Tony Warner and Michael Kay get their first run out for the Rovers, with other new signing Mark McChrystal on the bench.
It has been all change at Walsall this week, currently languishing at the bottom of the league; it is the first outing for the youth team manager, Dean Smith, in his role as caretaker manager, following this week’s departure of manager Chris Hutchings and his assistant, Martin O’Conner.
There were goals aplenty at Prenton Park, with Matthew Richards first hitting the back of the net for Walsall in the 32nd minute, closely followed by Emmanuele Smith’s own goal putting Tranmere Rovers on the score sheet with Rover’s Aaron Creswell sneaking in another in the 45th.
The second half looked to be Tranmere’s with a 56 minute strike from Lateef Elford but Walsall pressed on with Jonathan Macken scoring their second goal in the 85th minute and a header from Andy Butler in the 90th minute evening up the scoring to a 3-3 result with a point apiece.
WinkBall Video Citizen Reporters Sean, Tom, Tara and Terry were down at the ground to ask the fans for their views on the day’s proceedings, any messages for Les Parry and to find out just what was their highlight of the 2010 season so far.
