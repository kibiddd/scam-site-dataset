From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Not to be confused with Interactive computing.
In computer science, interactive computation is a mathematical model for computation that involves input/output communication with the external world during computation.
Uses[edit]
Among the currently studied mathematical models of computation that attempt to capture interaction are Giorgi Japaridze's hard- and easy-play machines elaborated within the framework of computability logic, Dina Q. Goldin's Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), and Yuri Gurevich's abstract state machines. Peter Wegner has additionally done a great deal of work on this area of computer science [citation needed].
