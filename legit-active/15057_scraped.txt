Paul Sharits was one of the primary innovators of Structural/avant-garde cinema beginning with his Fluxus-affiliated film pieces of the early 1960s and continuing through color "flicker" films and larger multi-projection installations, radically pioneering the shift of film works into gallery and museum spaces.
