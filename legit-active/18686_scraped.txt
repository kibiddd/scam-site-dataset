Montreal's Chinatown
Crossed by the street of La Gauchetiere, the Montreal’s Chinatown is delimited by four monumental doors, hand made by Chinese workers in the Nineties whereas Mr. Bouques, well known sinologist, was mayor.
Gates are delimiting the district form a quadrilateral between the St. Lawrence and Viger and the Coté street and Saint-Dominique.
Several great works have passably reduced size of Chinatown, not to name the construction of the Guy-Favereau complex.
Establishment of the Chinese district in this central part of the city occupied from the years 1850 testifies the early arrival of first Chinese in Montreal city. First Chinese Immigrants at the beginning of the XIX century where working as tailor or launderer.
Always alive, Chinatown remains really important for people of the Chinese diasporas as well as the descendants of second and third generation. Many restaurants and shops of Eastern medicine testify an economic strength whereas the presence of the Chinese hospital (formerly located on Saint-Denis in Villeray) shows a will for the community to maintain this district active and in the center of the community.
Discover the Chinese districts through its buildings and of the photographs of streets.
