Are incredibly defensive of Dublin, (for obvious reasons, everyone seems to dislike Dubliners?) Even though most can be 'dead sound' or 'a legend'
In the northside, typically, you are more likely to come across the tracksuit, 45 degree caps, runners types "Here yooou! Giz a fookin fag or sometin!"
And the southside, 80% of the time you are more likely to find, the preppy 5 stone guys and girls, that daddy buys everything for, the 'I just fucked this up' hairstyle that took 4 hours, rudgy, ponies, cars, OMG!
But it is not uncommon to find posh places in the northside and skanger places in the southside, Ballybrack + Shankill for example. These poor people have to live with the stigma of technically living in the southside, EVEN THOUGH daddy cant buy them a break my windows (BMW)#1: Like OMG hi! A Dubliner! Roish where abouts are you from
#:2 Eh, the southside (wtf is wrong with yer hair? Were you dragged backwards through a bush?)
#1: OMG!!!! Loike me too!! How many ponies and BMW's do you have???
#2: None? My dad cant afford to buy me a pony right now? I have a nice little Toyota though?
#1: a Toyota?......loike, what is wrong with you? Thats what people in the third world drive? Omg! Where did you say you were from again?

located on the east coast, Dublin was originally a viking, then Anglo-Saxon port, because places like Dun-Laoghaire make ideal natural ports. the name comes from the Gaelic 'dubh linn' meaning black lake.
Dublin is home to almost half the 4.8 million people living in Ireland.
Dublin is traditionally divided into the more affluent south, and less affluent north sides by the liffy river.
notes for visitors:
Temple bar, in the middle of Dublin city has the best night life.
Defontain's in temple bar( on the right as you exit the allyway through the central bank) has the best pizza you will ever eat.
Traditional Irish food is just potatoes...don't bother.
Try the pubs, but they're not all good... choose carefully.
there are no leprechauns in Ireland. If you ask about them you're liable to quickly end a conversation.
The countryside, like with many countries, is nice to look at, but none too interesting.
Ireland is expensive, by any countries standards. notably, Alcohol, clothes, and taxis are well above average.
