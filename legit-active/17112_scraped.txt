The Covid-19 situation is still evolving. No matter the change, our first priority will always be the health and well being of our customers, staff, and partners. We are monitoring and adapting all health and safety recommendations as currently expressed by Federal, State, and Local authorities. We will be updating our procedures and policies as required for the health of our communities.
As always, our master bed makers, warehouse, and support teams are still on the payroll, ready to provide safe, reliable service.
We've been making beds and mattresses in New York since 1855.
Over that long history, we've been through good times and bad.
And have learned again and again, working together, the American spirit will always prevail.
These days a good nights' sleep is more important than ever and we're here to give you exactly that.
- The Charles P. Rogers Team

The Bed Experts
Why Rogers?
Factory direct prices
We design and build the beds we make and only sell direct from our showrooms and website.
This eliminates middleman markups and allows us to sell for less.
100 day trial
We at Charles P. Rogers are committed to ensuring your utmost comfort. Our 100 Day Comfort Trial is designed to give you the
peace of mind to adjust the comfort, exchange your mattress for another model of the same size, or return it for a refund, if
you're not completely satisfied.
Low monthly payments
A new bed or mattress is a big purchase, that's why we offer monthly payment plans.
Take 12 months to pay, interest free. Click here to see your lowest possible monthly
payment on a new bed or mattress.
