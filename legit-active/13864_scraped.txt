Featured Spotlight Andy Hunt Student Success Coordinator At FSU since 2019
View Bio
What I enjoy most about working in the Office of Student Success (OSS) is watching our students go from struggling to thriving. I love seeing their faces turn from sad, anxious, or frustrated to calm, smiling, and joyful after they attend one of our events, take advantage of the services we offer, or simply stop by our office in between classes for a quick check-in or a snack. I feel good knowing that the OSS is making such a positive difference in the lives of our music students here at FSU!
