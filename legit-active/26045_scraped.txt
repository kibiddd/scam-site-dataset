Together we can help them reach their full potential. Learn MoreAbout America SCORES' ProgramsAmerica SCORES offers after-school programs in 13 cities that support whole child development through the teamwork of soccer, the creativity of poetry, and the compassion of service-learning.
SoccerThe most popular game in the world teaches kids teamwork, leadership, and commitment. Our year-round program helps level the playing field for at-risk youth, and keeps kids healthy and active.
PoetryOne of humanity's oldest forms of self-expression, poetry helps our kids find their voice, and through that find their confidence and a sense of identity. Our Poetry Slam! gives our kids a platform to be heard by their community and peers.
Service-learningCreating fully-formed citizens starts with teaching our kids to be stewards of their local communities. Our service learning program is led by the poet-athletes, and transforms them to directly support their community.What is a Poet-Athlete?America SCORES programs build teams of poet-athletes, young people who are committed to their physical, emotional, and social well-being. Poet-athletes use their voices to express themselves, serve as leaders in their communities, and speak up against injustice.
​
Poet-Athletes build healthy bodies, minds, and communities through the vehicles of soccer, poetry, and service learning. Poet-Athletes express themselves creatively, improve their writing skills, and learn to think critically on and off the field.
​
Mentors and coaches in our programs encourage poet-athletes to be supportive, dynamic, productive youth and citizens in their communities — a critical part of fostering future community-centric leadership and growth.
​
The Results? Through poetry, soccer, and service learning, Poet-Athletes are given the tools and resources for a platform to grow up to be influential adults: activists, mentors, leaders, and agents of change. Learn MoreAmerica SCORES' Reach13Affiliates300+Schools800+Coaches800+Volunteers20,000+Poet-AthletesAmerica SCORES AnnoucmentsAmerica SCORES' World Cup LegacyDid you know that America SCORES was birthed from the Legacy efforts of the 1994 World Cup?
