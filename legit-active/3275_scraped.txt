Holiday Villas - Bang Por Beach - Koh Samui – Thailand
Secluded in private tropical gardens next to Bang Por Beach on the quiet north coast of Koh Samui, overlooking Koh Phangan, in Thailand, Banyan Villas provides luxury rental accommodation at affordable prices for both short holidays and long stay visitors.
Holiday Villa rentals are a great alternative to traditional luxury hotel accommodation, especially for families and anyone in search of a little privacy, or an escape from the madding high season tourist crowds.
