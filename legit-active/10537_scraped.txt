But there were some players who stood out more than others.Just as was done for the 2011 playoffs (see link), three Sharks are singled out as the top stars of the team's regular season.TOP NEWSThe Biggest Regret For The NHL's Most Disappointing TeamsBleacher Report1dEvery NHL Team's 2025 Toughest Free-Agent DecisionBleacher Report1dNHL Playoff Standings 2025: Predicting Which Teams Won't Make Postseason BracketBleacher Report1d1. Antti NiemiFor the season, Nemo played 60 games, going 35-18-6 with six shutouts, a .920 save percentage and 2.38 goals against average. All those numbers place him near the middle of the pack for starters except in wins and shutouts‚Äîhardly worthy of the team's first star.However, he played in 36 of the team's last 37 games when Anterro Niittymaki went down with an injury and was extraordinary. He went 26-5-4, including four shutouts and 26 games with a save percentage better than .900. During that span, he allowed just 78 goals (2.13 GAA) on 1,029 shots (.924 save percentage), leading the Sharks from the 12th to second spot in the Western Conference by the end of the season.2. Logan CoutureThe Sharks rookie was instrumental all season for San Jose, playing well in all three zones at even strength, short-handed and on the power play. He finished second on the team in goals with 32, seventh on the team with 24 assists and first among forwards (second overall) at plus-18.¬†Couture also came through when it was most important, as his eight game-winners and 10 power play goals were both one behind the team leader(s).3. Dan BoyleBoyler had almost over twice as many points (50) as the next best Sharks defenceman (Ian White had 26 between three teams, but Jason Demers' 24 was second as a member of the Sharks). His 41 assists were third on the team, and he led the team in ice time as he was called on to play both ends but still finished plus-two for the season.Boyle also showed great leadership, with two of his nine goals being game-winners. But more than anything, during the six games he missed, we found out how essential he was as the team's power play came to a crashing halt (he had four power play goals during the regular season). This is what gave him the edge over Ryane Clowe (24 G, 38 A, +13) for third star.03:04 New York Rangers Top 10 Plays of the WeekTOP NEWSBiggest Regrets for Disappointing Teams üò£Bleacher Report1dEvery Team's Toughest FA Decision ü§îBleacher Report1dPredicting Which Teams Miss Playoffs üîÆBleacher Report1dUpdated B/R NHL Draft Big Board Bleacher Report3dRasmus Dahlin Landing Spots üìçBleacher Report2dTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢1d2025 NBA Mock Draft: 2-Round Predictions and Pro Comps Before NCAA Sweet 16Updated projections after first two rounds of March MadnessBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMLB Predictions 2025: Updated Win-Loss Projections for Every TeamBleacher Report‚Ä¢2d2025 NFL Free Agents Who Signed With the Wrong TeamBreaking down early free agency's worst movesBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dWWE Raw on Netflix Results: Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights From ScotlandBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMen's NCAA Tournament 2025: Upset Meter for Every Sweet 16 GameRating each underdog's chances of advancing to the regional finals üì≤TRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢1d2025 NBA Mock Draft: 2-Round Predictions and Pro Comps Before NCAA Sweet 16Updated projections after first two rounds of March MadnessBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMLB Predictions 2025: Updated Win-Loss Projections for Every TeamBleacher Report‚Ä¢2d2025 NFL Free Agents Who Signed With the Wrong TeamBreaking down early free agency's worst movesBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dWWE Raw on Netflix Results: Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights From ScotlandBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMen's NCAA Tournament 2025: Upset Meter for Every Sweet 16 GameRating each underdog's chances of advancing to the regional finals üì≤Bleacher ReportAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersSitemapCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyCookie PreferencesTerms Of UseB/R Sports on MAXB/R Creators ProgramCopyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
