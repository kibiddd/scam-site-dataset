Keeping Families Close
We provide a respite for thousands of families with seriously ill children while they receive care at nearby medical facilities. Our Houses and Family Rooms offer comforting surroundings where family members can stay together during a time of uncertainty and stress. Keeping families close allows them to spend more time with their child, interact with their clinical care team and participate in critical medical decisions. Your generosity has enabled us to support our families for more than a quarter of a century. We thank you for providing us with the opportunity to help even more families stay close through the biggest challenge of their lives.
