KALAMAZOO —Tapping into his experience in the film industry, Jake Hambright, along with his girlfriend Teresa Bailey, both of Portage, will be opening the Sunset Boulevard Brewing Company as soon as mid-July.Shawano Cleary / Special to the GazetteRoom to roam: The Sunset Boulevard Brewing Company, which is expected to open in mid-July, will have a capacity of 186 people.
Hambright has lived in Los Angeles and Chicago, and helps run two independent film/TV/entertainment companies, 1974 Film Company and Intense Film Group, which is co-owned with Ultimate Fighting Champion Dan Severn.He said he plans to make Sunset a House of Blues-type venue with entertainment, food, craft beer, wine and spirits.Sunset, to be located in the old R. Stanley’s Diner space at 4212 Portage St., will have a Hollywood theme and include appearances by B-movie actors, such as Erin Moran, who played Joanie Cunningham from “Happy Days,” Hambright said.Some Sunset craft beer, to be made by Trevor Klimek, who has worked at Bell’s Brewery Inc. for the last six years, will be named after actors, Hambright said.Shawano Cleary / Special to the Gazette“Kalamazoo is already a well-educated beer community, so I could only build on that,” said Hambright, 36.The 4,100-square-foot building will have a capacity of 186 people (seating for 100) and a patio for around 30 people, Hambright said. It will be similar in look and feel to The Union Cabaret & Grille — “an upscale venue with a lot of creativity whether it’s music or other forms of entertainment. It’s going to have a great vibe.”Hambright, who grew up in Holland, said Sunset will have a two-barrel brewing system and it will offer between eight and 10 beers at a time.As for food, Hambright said to expect burgers, steaks, sandwiches, salads and a few surprises.“We don’t want to be limited to just pub grub,” he said.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
