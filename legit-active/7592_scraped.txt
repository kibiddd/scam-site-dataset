Live reviews
All Shall Perish is a death core band from the LA area that have been running the scene for quite some time. All Shall Perish brings a machine gun fury of brutal death metal on your ears. No bullshit stage antics, no backtracks, just a forty five minute assault of blazing guitars and powerful drums.
If getting scared sounds like your brand of fun this is the band for you. They bring back the feeling of watching a horror movie and wanting to hide your face with a blanket. They pound your ear drums into submission and you will love it. M The crowd started moshing as soon as the band got on stage.
All Shall Perish is super tight not missing a single thirty second note throughout their whole set(which is hard to do considering the speed and technicality of their music). Eddie Hermida shrieks and growls across the stage like a satanic demon unleashed upon the world. Eddie would keep yelling for more energy throughout the night and the crowd never gave up.
When the opening riff of Wage Slaves started the audience went completely nuts and the whole ballroom turned into a giant battlefield of moshing.
