About Me
I'm Steve Baldy. I am a very detail oriented photographer with imagination to spare! I hope to network with like minded professionals here on Model Mayhem.
I am open to trade work with models.  I will provide 3-4 edited photos per look.  I require a model release.  I do not pay models.
I do allow model escorts - but please, only one, and they must stay out of the shooting area and not be disruptive to the shoot.
I am open to shooting in my at-home studio or on location. We can achieve any theme you may want!
When working with me, I will be prompt and professional, and I expect the same of the people I work with.
Please message me here if you would like to work together.  I will get back to you as quickly as possible.
Thanks for viewing!
