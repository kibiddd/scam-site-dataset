I recently purchased as used 2001 SeaDoo Challenger 2000 boat with the 200HP engine.    I have never owned a jet boat before, so I've got a few questions.  I am looking to learn a bit more about these boats, and set up a maintenance schedule.  I am a very handy guy, able to do everything from minor to major work on almost anything that burns fossel fuels, but also know that there are things best left to the pro's.
Things to keep an eye out for (IE common problem areas)
Maintenace suggestions / requirements.
More info on the motor/drive.  I cant find much on the internet, and have no manuals with the boat.
Any and all info you can give will be greatly recieved!!

Congrats on the new doo!  The first thing you will have to learn with a jet boat is how to maneuver at low speeds, this can be the trickiest part of owning a jet boat.  Once you get it mastered it will be smooth sailing.Before we got our 180 Challenger we had a 2000 Speedster that also had a Mercury engine, we had no problems with ours over the 5 years we had it.  Just keep up with your oil, make sure you keep it filled up since you will be burning both oil and gasoline.  The good thing about this is you will never have to change you oil, the bad thing is it sometimes gets costly depending on how quickly you are burning it.  Keep up with your spark plugs.  As far as maintenance, our boat was garage kept so all we did was put some fuel stabilizer in a full tank (to prevent condensation) and disconnect the battery for winterization.At the beginning of the season, charge the battery, check the plugs (replace if needed) and possibly put some of Mercury's Quickleen product in if needed.  Here a link to get a little more information on your engine, http://www.mercuryma...-jet-drives.php.Welcome to the website!

Thanks for the info, it is much appreciated.  I have loaded jet skis before, so I understand the issue, but I am sure it will take some getting used to.  The biggest thing now is that I have to teach my wife how to drive it, and the basics of trailering.  Should be fun!!

The biggest thing now is that I have to teach my wife how to drive it, and the basics of trailering.  Should be fun!!If you have 200 HP then it must be the 2.4 liter Mercury Marine Optimax. That is a great engine, get the most out of it by keeping the battery charged as Optimax engines like a good, well charged battery. Don't forget to put the flush valve plug back on when you are done flushing the engine. Also please use the Quicksilver DFI oil. It along with other specialty 2 stroke oils will give you the best service. I've seen high hour Optimax engines apart and there is a difference between Quicksilver oil and the cheap stuff. If you do get caught and have to put another brand of oil in the engine make sure it is Direct Fuel Injection or DFI oil. Have fun with the new Doo.Kevin SeeberKingsland Marine

As far as any Mercury manuals you may have to grab it from the link provided or get it via email because we were asked by Mercury to quit distributing their manuals or they were going to take legal action.

I did download and print the Operator's Manual, and the Shop Manual.  I also read about the Mercury manual issue, seems like they want their money for them.....
I plan on taking the Doo out for a bit today after work, so I'll probably update tomorrow.
Thanks again to everyone for your input.
