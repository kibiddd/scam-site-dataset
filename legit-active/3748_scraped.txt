Big 12 Championship Football Championship Game Tickets
The Big 12 Championship Game is played on the first Saturday in December; a day before the college bowl game announcements. The two teams competing in the Big 12 Championship are the teams that finish the regular-season ranked 1st and 2nd in the conference. The most important reward is the winner of this game is crowned the Conference Champion, but the bigger prize is potentially earning a spot in the College Football Playoff. The winner of this game may earn a bid for the College Football Playoff and perhaps to play for a National Championship. The team that loses may still play in the Sugar Bowl against an SEC opponent.
The Big 12 Championship game ranks annually among the top games in college football. It is often a rematch of a game played during the regular-season, which always amps up the demand as one team is seeking to avenge an earlier loss. Demand for Big 12 Championship tickets typically starts to heat up in the second half of the season as many fans want to secure their tickets before its even official whether their favorite team will earn a spot in this big game. We offer tickets to all Big 12 football games, as well as, college basketball games including the Big 12 Tournament in KC and Big 12 baseball games.
The best weekend in college football may be the last of the regular-season as that's when the conference champions are decided. The Big 12 Championship is played on same day as the ACC Championship Game, Big Ten Championship Game the popular SEC Championship Game. The Pac-12 Football Championship has moved to the Friday prior in order to have its own time slot. The Big 12 typically kicks off early prior to the start of the SEC Championship Game. The ticket prices on these games vary greatly from year-to-year, but the SEC tickets typically cost the most followed by the Big 12 Championship.
Big 12 Championship at AT&T Stadium
There may not be a better venue for a college football championship game than AT&T Stadium. Our customer who have attended the Big 12 Football Championship loved the experience of watching a great college football game in this first-class football stadium. It is located just 20 minutes west of downtown Dallas is the home to this game, as well as, the home field for the Dallas Cowboys. The capacity for AT&T Stadium is around 80,000 people. There are 4 main seating levels inside the stadium: the 100 level, 200 level, 300 level and 400 level.
100 Level
The lowest level provides great views of the action on the field. The sections on the lower level are 101-150 and there are typically 20-22 rows throughout. The sideline sections are "club" seats which have access to the club area which contains premium food & beverage options. This is where fans sit who want to be closest to the action on the field and hear the players on the sideline. The club sections here are among the nicest seats in the building.
200 Level
The second tier includes sections 201-250. There are 12-15 rows in each 200 level section. These are still low enough to provide a terrific view of the field. The sideline seats in the 200-level that are in the club area have access to the club area which has premium food & beverage options. The 200-level is just a bit higher than the 100-level, but still offers a first-class view of the action on the field.
300 Level
The 300 level includes sections 301-350. There are 16-17 rows in 300-level sections, except those in the Endzone seats which may only 5 rows. This section is a level up from the 100 & 200-level, but these seats still provide a nice view of game and access to great concessions.
400 Level
The highest level of this massive stadium offers excellent sight lines for an upper-level seat. It is also the best vantage point to see the massive HD video screen, which stretches from one 20-yard line to the other. The 400 level includes sections 401-460. There are typically 27-30 rows on sideline sections, then 22-24 rows in corner areas and as few as five rows in 400 level endzone sections. Fans who sit in the top-level at AT&T Stadium often report being mesmerized by the amazing, gigantic jumbotron visible easily from these seats. The 400-level seats are going to offer the cheapest tickets available for the Big 12 Championship.
