The film features Elodie Bouchez, who appears in all three of these films, to date. The young people and their school in this film are, however, in another league. We are shown here the French equivalent of the prestigious English public schools. Curiously, French films set in this milieu are as scarce as British films on the subject are numerous. This is one of the film's most interesting aspects. The intrigue among these elite students is made captivating due to the casting of France's cream of youth talent: Morel, Melvil Poupaud, and the now universally acclaimed Elodie Bouchez. I recommend it only for francophiles seeking a rare contemporary glimpse of the children of the "Grande Bourgeoisie".gonz30May 8, 1999PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 13, 1995 (France)Country of originFranceLanguageFrenchAlso known asNajpiękniejszy wiekProduction companiesBloody Mary ProductionsCanal+La Sept CinémaSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 25 minutesColorColorAspect ratio1.66 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Spanish language plot outline for Those Were the Days (1995)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
