Listener Comments and Reviewsthe greatest radio station i have heard.too bad it can not be streamed on line. By: anthony on October 30, 2011
On Sunday, Jan. 20th, 2013, I was listening to a priest interviewing a writer of books, articles re: the Catholic Church.  I was listening around 8:30 am and do not know what time the program started perhaps 8 am.
The woman who was being interviewed has a recent book concerning 12 stories of the bible.  I want to order the book, but I do not have her name or the title of the book.
Can you provide the information or how to locate listings on-line.
Thank you.By: Janet L Dill on January 20, 2013
I live in Brooklyn but I love to listen to 1410 because it plays the type of music I like to listen to. I know I have 101.1 but they play songs I don't care for.  Most of the time it's static because I am out of range, but it's the best around.By: marshall on April 3, 2018
I listen everyday in the car, it has the best oldies ever.. Wish it would go on line  so i  could listen in the home. By: doowopbob on September 20, 2018
Please! Find new songs! We listen Mon-Friday and it's the same songs. 100.7 FM There are hundreds of songs from the 60's that you don't even venture and the artist have more than one play. They made other records. PLEASE it has become so boring and repetative. Thank youBy: Diane L. on June 4, 2021
