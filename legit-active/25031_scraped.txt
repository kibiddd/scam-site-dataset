The Beamon family lived in Dorset and Gloucestershire. "There existed at a remote period, a family of Beaumont in Normandy, and it was, probably, one of its cadets whose name was inscribed on the muster Roll at Battle. Certain it is that he could not have been the founder of the illustrious House of Beaumont, which, in two centuries after, appears so prominently conspicuous among the most potent barons of the realm, and which was established in this country by Henry de Beaumont, fourth son of Agnes de Beaumont, by her husband, Louie, second son of Charles, Kind of Jerusalem, and nephew of Loius IX. of France." 1Loading... Early Origins of the Beamon familyThe surname Beamon was first found in Dorset and Gloucestershire, where "Roger de Belmont appears in [the] Domesday [Book] as chief tenant. According to Sir H. Ellis, he was a near kinsman of the Conqueror, being lineal descendant of that king's great grandfather. Some trace the noble English families from the Viscounts Beaumont of Normandy, and others from the blood-royal of France." 2 The chapelry of Ryall in Northumberland is of particular interest to the family. "This was the lordship of John, Lord Beaumont, who died seised of Ryall about the year 1396, leaving it, with many other estates in this county and elsewhere, to his son and heir, Henry, then sixteen years of age, who was knighted at the coronation of Henry IV." 3 Upper Whitley in the West Riding of Yorkshire was home to another branch of the family. "The founder of the ancient family of Beaumont here, was a Knight Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem, who received the manor on condition of performing certain military services in the time of Henry III. Whitley Hall has ever since been the principal residence of the family, and is now in the possession of R. H. Beaumont, Esq. [(c. 1860)]" 3Robert de Beaumont (d. 1118), was Count of Meulan, a feudal statesman and son of Roger de Beaumont ('de Bellomonte' in the Latinized form) and grandson of Humfrey de Vielles. 4His son, Robert de Beaumont Earl of Leicester (1104-1168), was Justiciary of England, and a twin with his brother Waleran. Waleran de Beaumont Count of Meulan (1104-1166), was a warrior and feudal statesman and twin brother of Robert, Earl of Leicester. Robert de Beaumont Earl of Leicester (d. 1190), was a baronial leader and son of Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester. 4"The leading manor of South Tawton, [Devon] was once in the Beaumonts, being granted by Henry I. to Roselm Beaumont, Viscount de Mayne, whose granddaughter brought it to Roger de Tony." 5Loading...

Beamon migration to the United States +The unstable environment in England at this time caused numerous families to board ships and leave in search of opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad in places like Ireland, Australia, and particularly the New World. The voyage was extremely difficult, however, and only taken at great expense. The cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels caused many to arrive diseased and starving, not to mention destitute from the enormous cost. Still opportunity in the emerging nations of Canada and the United States was far greater than at home and many went on to make important contributions to the cultures of their adopted countries.
