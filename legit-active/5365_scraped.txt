Early Days:
Philip Goldstein born  in 1913 in Montreal,  Canada, Guston moved with  his family to Los Angeles  as a child. Guston's Ukrainian-Jewish parents escaped persecution when they  moved from Odessa, Ukraine. Guston and his family were  aware of the regular Klan activities against Jews, blacks and others which took  place across California  during Guston's childhood. When Guston was 10 or 11, his father hanged himself  in the shed, and the young Guston found the body. Guston began painting at the  age of 14, and in 1927 he enrolled in the Los Angeles Manual   Arts High    School, where both he and Jackson Pollock studied  under Frederick John de St. Vrain Schwankovsky and were introduced to Modern  European art, oriental philosophy, theosophy and mystic literature.
