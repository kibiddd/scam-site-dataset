Thousands of shoppers trekked to Fifth Avenue on Friday to be among the first to see Uniqlo's largest global flagship store revealed (at 89,000 square feet, it's the biggest single retail space on avenue).
When Mayor Bloomberg cut the ribbon at noon, he said the store would add more than a thousand new jobs; and Uniqlo CEO and Japan's richest man Tadashi Yanai -- whose father started the company as a tiny menswear shop in Japan more than 50 years ago -- said the opening was the realization of his "American Dream."
Retail workers trained for up to three months just for the store's opening day. We captured the moment while alongside members of the media from around the world (including many from Japan and at least one from France), and even braved the chaos once the doors were opened.
The press swarmed the storefront, and shoppers lined up all the way to Sixth Avenue
