Liberty Bell Museum - Dent in the Bell My wife and I stopped off at the Liberty Bell Museum while down for Washington Nationals Spring Training. The full size Liberty Bell now has a dent in the lip of the bell after it had an accident in a local parade. It fell or shifted on the float and has an obvious dent that you can see as you face the front of the Liberty Bell.
It still has no crack in the Bell, though.

Liberty Bell in a Water Tank Visitors to Florida's SpaceCoast, should drive a few more miles south and see the Liberty Bell Memorial Museum. Its centerpiece is a full-sized replica of the Liberty Bell. The museum is a remodeled ground water tank and contains many artifacts from American battles around the world as well as replicas of historic documents, planes and ships.
