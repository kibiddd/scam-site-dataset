Explore the past and its role in today’s world: from prehistoric cultures through ancient Greece and Rome, to the Industrial Revolution and beyond.
All you need is an interest for the subject – our courses are suitable even if you haven’t studied Classics or Archaeology before. You’ll learn from our expert staff, have opportunities to gain work experience in our on-campus museum or Digital Transformations Hub, and benefit from specialist facilities, including six archaeological laboratories.
The latest Research Excellence Framework judged more than 75% of our research as 'world leading' or ‘internationally excellent', and our students are supported to participate in national and international research projects.
