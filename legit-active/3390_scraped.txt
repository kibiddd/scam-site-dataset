Funkadelic – Comin' Round The Mountain                                lyrics
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Ridin' two white horses when she comes
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes
(x2)
Doin' it!
Because we like it
Doin' it!
Just for fun
(x2)
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Ridin' two white horses when she comes
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes
(x2)
Doin' it!
Because we like it
Doin' it!
Just for fun
(x2)
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Ridin' two white horses when she comes
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Ridin' two white horses when she comes
Comin' around the mountain when she comes
Ridin' two white horses when she comes
Doin' it!
Because we like it
Doin' it!
Just for fun
