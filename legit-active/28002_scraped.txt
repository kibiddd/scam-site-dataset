The Kungfu Mailing List
The Kungfu Mailing List is a world-wide listserv devoted to discussions about all traditional
chinese martial arts, with some 350 members world-wide, in
it's 10th year of operation.  Quite a large variety of schools and
styles are represented in its membership, which includes people
from at least 30 different countries around the world.  Many of our
members are well-versed in traditional chinese martial arts practice,
theory and history - some are quite famous exponents of their styles.
We keep the
kungfu
list archives
available where past conversations are preserved for posterity.
An FAQ explains how to use the list managing
software.  If you prefer web discussion areas, please feel free to take
part in our online martial arts
forums, which are well focussed and have areas specific to
kungfu and
modern
arnis, as well as general
martial arts.
