59 Socialists in Congress – 2002
By Chuck Morse  Published 09. 6. 02 at 20:00 Sierra Time
On the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party, The Progressive Caucus is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, which, in turn, is the American affiliate of the Socialist International.  Congressional Caucus members, I would contend, should actually be called Socialists rather than Democrats. Unlike their European counterparts, these homegrown American Socialist Congressmen try to refrain from showing their true authoritarian colors. Such displays would be too risky in an America that is still steeped in traditional freedoms. There are still enough of us out here who would boot them out of office if they revealed too much of their true stripe.  Socialists, like Communists, Nazis, Klansmen, or other political groups, rightfully enjoy the same constitutional protections as the rest of us. Unlike their more radical aforementioned counterparts however, the socialists believe in changing the system by "boring from within" rather than through illegal violence and sedition. As such, they prefer legislation, often filled with deceptive legalese and passed through Congress by duplicitous means, as their choice of arms in their quest toward revolutionary goals. Socialists are gradualists rather than extremists. They are slowly chipping away at our G-d given rights. Freedom loving Americans would be well advised to keep a close eye on socialist Congressmen. While they may talk like the rest of us, especially when sojourning in their respective districts, they operate from a different paradigm. If they decide to support a war against Iraq, for example, or any other intervention overseas, their motives would more likely be based on an agenda that seeks to entangle the US in a new world order than in protecting the interests of sovereign America. As a matter of principle and as an article of faith, socialists support a socialist world government as an ultimate goal. The method they employ is the gradual transfer of constitutional responsibilities from elected American legislatures to international agencies accountable to no one. Socialists are apt to support such things as international standing armies, an international tax, the transfer of American capital to third world dictators, and the surrender of congressional responsibilities to the UN, the WTO, the IMF, UNESCO and now the International Criminal Court. Whenever communistic protocols emerge out of a UN sponsored conference, as is always the case, and whenever such un-American protocols are rejected by a still largely patriotic Congress, the socialist congressmen and their allies will more than likely try to foist the protocol on the American people through a back door. Socialists believe in sovereignty eroding entanglements abroad and big-state socialism at home. They support high taxes on working people with the money transferred to bureaucracies staffed by their friends. They support a welfare state that oppresses poor people, especially minorities, who then become their constituents. They support left-wing judges who are willing to subvert the democratic power of Congress by making laws from the bench. While they support mandatory public education, mandatory labor unions, mandatory racial quotas, land-grabbing environmental regulation, and thought control in the form of hate speech legislation, they turn around and become downright libertarian when it comes to pornography, abortion, sex, drugs, homosexuality, and other agendas that debauch the citizenry.Following is the Sept. 2002 membership list of the Progressive Caucus: Neil Abercrombie – Hawaii Tammy Baldwin – Wisconsin Xavier Becerra – California David Bonior – Michigan Corrine Brown – Florida Sherron Brown – Ohio Michael Capuano – Mass. Julia Carson – Indiana William "Lacy" Clay – Missouri John Conyers – Michigan Danny Davis – Illinois Peter DeFazio – Oregon Rosa DeLauro – Conn.

DSA-USA is the prime mover-and-shaker working for the overthrow of our Constitutional Republic. As Jim Robinson has said elsewhere, many times on other threads, we need to get the Democrats out of office across the board. All of these scumbags should be on every FReepers hit-list for defeat.

Ok, Freepers, if you see your state listed here, get up off your duff, get the e mails flying, phones ringing, and get on those walking shoes! Go door to door, talk to people at work, start a REAL grassroot effort in your area to remove the vermin from office! One voice, one vote, won't get the job done. Get out there and shout it from the rooftop, encourage others to do the same!

Is there a list of these commies on the dsa website? I could not find it but it sure would be more effective to expose these slimeballs if the dsa actually named them.

The universal trait of fascism is criminally corrupt socialism. From '30's Italy and Germany to the tyranny of "communism" and Islamic theocracies, the self-appointed elite of each society takes control, directly or indirectly of their economies' critical factors of production, aka political spoils, as any self-indulging mafia don. National wealth is concentrated among the elite and their chosen few while the masses live under "penaly of law".
The Clintons both are criminally corrupt with a brazen lust for power not often seen in English speaking countries. Bill and Hillary have been allowed by frustrated American socialists and RINOs to assemble their own vision of a politburo in the Democrat Party, out of control federal courts, and the unionized, regulatory system protected by over-broad sovereign immunity.
IMO, Hillary is has visions of Lenin and Stalin, not Eleanor Roosevelt. The Clinton pogrom at the Mt. Carmel church in 1993 is all the warning American citizens should ever need as to Hillary's use of the power of the State. Just ask Vince Foster.

The only reason Hillary Clinton's name is not publically listed is that it would ruin her presedential dreams.

If you are stuck with a broken down car and can't replace it, focus friend. Forget the hub caps. Forget the chrome. Breaks are important. So is steering. An oil leak is livable. You can even get by with a cracked radiator. Don't just throw your hands up in the air and tell the boss you can't drive to work any more. Good grief.
