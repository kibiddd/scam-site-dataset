Chicago Tribune
Though the film falls short of its aspirations, there's something magical about it. It's a poetic look at transience, betrayal, loss and doom.

A curious but intriguing movie that leaves you bemused and more than a little confused.

The Man Who Cried is a film directed by Sally Potter and is about a girls journey to reunite with her father. This film is a perfect example of visual story telling at it's best. Our main character speaks so rarely that we need good visuals and great score to explain the story, which this film has. The movement of the camera combined with the directors singular view make the film flawless, but what really stuck out for me is the score. The score is used in such away that it makes you feel like you are watching a modern day opera. This film is near perfection, however it is not for everyone. Like I said our main character has vary few lines and the same is true for her love interest, so if you are looking for film to spoon feed you the plot than this film will disappoint. You really need to be an art lover and a theater nerd to really get this film. In conclusion if you are looking for a fantastic art film than this is the film for you.

The title had more intriguing story than the actual movie
No disrespect, but I was more curious about what man was the story about because, the main character was his child, but it was pretty obvious. The actors played well, but the story was pretty common and predictable, easy solving, she could have skipped the drama and found him earlier, but that's the charm of it. It was good to see Turturro again, and not in a comedy movie, the others too, Johnny really looked like a gypsy. Peace & Love!

There's only one performer in the movie who looks completely at ease with what he's doing: the horse.

A thing of beauty. But then so is a cloud and I wouldn't want to stare at one of those for an hour and half.

The Man Who Cried is like a Yiddish generational tearjerker told from the perspective of the lost child rather than that of the bereaved parent.

Variety
Sally Potter, who leapt to critical attention with her 1992 adaptation of Virginia Woolf's "Orlando" -- makes a serious misstep with The Man Who Cried.

The driving drama of such a desperate situation is lost in the movie's casting silliness.

Who would've thought that a movie starring Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett, John Turturro, Johnny Depp, and Harry Dean Stanton could be this disasterly awful, the movie started pretty powerful and they really telling what was the main point of the film then comes the present day at the times, and suddenly the movie or the story losing their main point completely with adding a very useless love story that is literally 90% of the film played with an unconvincing characters that again played awfully by all the cast with their horrible horrible accent, Christina Ricci was awful, Cate Blanchett who were always good in her previous movie before this, somehow giving her worst and it is indeed so far her worst performances yet, John Turturro was awful, and Johnny Depp is also awful PLUS he seems boring throughout the film and he really look like that he did not have any interest on playing the part in this movie, and then suddenly the last 10 minutes of the film they somehow going back to the main point and they just ended the movie just like that, it's just so unbelievable how this movie is really awfully made not only in terms of a performance but the even worst which is the story, the best performance in the movie is Harry Dean Stanton but his character did not do a lot too, the other is the Young Suzie in the beginning of the film, same case she did not appear a lot, and the other good thing is that this movie is not long, i am so happy when the credits roll, so happy that the movie was ended because i just cannot stand it anymore, The Man Who Cried is just another example of a movie that fills with a great cast but the story of the movie itself and the direction is awful, then the movie became awful completely, so awful, a mess, and it's too bad.
