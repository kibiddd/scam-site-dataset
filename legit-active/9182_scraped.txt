TIPPING IT OFF
The Arkansas State men's basketball team opens its 2011-12 home schedule Tuesday with a 7:05 p.m. match up against Missouri State. The Red Wolves home schedule includes 15 regular season contests.
THE OPPONENT
Missouri State enters the contest with a 1-0 record after wining on the road at Nevada, 68-46, in their season opener. The Bears have just one starter back from last season in senior forward and Preseason Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year Kyle Weems, who averaged 16.0 points and 6.9 rebounds last year. Weems was named the MVC Player of the Year in 2010-11 and scored four points with six rebounds against Nevada. 6-11 center Caleb Patterson led the Bears with 17 points in their season opener against Nevada. Missouri State was picked to finish sixth in the MVC Preseason Coaches Poll after losing to Indiana State in the MVC Championship game last season. The Bears went on to the NIT last year beating Murray State 89-76, but lost to Miami 81-72. Paul Lusk is in his first season as head coach of the Bears.
THE SERIES
The Red Wolves are 25-37 all-time against Missouri State including dropping two contests against the Bears last season. IN their meetings last season Missouri Beat ASU 80-71 in the opening round of the NIT Season Tipoff and 77-70 in Springfield, Mo.
LAMAR GAME
Lamar's Anthony Miles laid the ball in with just seven seconds remaining to give the Cardinals the lead 64-62, a free throw set the final at 65-62 over Arkansas State in the two squad's season opener at the Montagne Center Friday.
The Red Wolves led by as many as nine in the second half and had two players in double-figures led by junior guard Marcus Hooten with 15. Junior forward Brandon Peterson added 14 points with eight rebounds and a pair of blocks to lead ASU in those two categories. Peterson played 39 minutes for the Red Wolves, a career high.
The Red Wolves led most of the second half until Charlie Harper tied the game for Lamar with 1:21 left in the game.
Malcoln Kirkland gave the Red Wolves their largest lead of the night when he connected on a jumper with 17:06 left in the game putting ASU up by nine, 46-37.
A-State trailed by as many as eight points in the first half, but a free throw by Hooten with just 50-seconds remaining put the Red Wolves up 37-36 at the break. Peterson led the Red Wolves with eight first-half points. Finn had six points and four rebounds at the break.
HOME OPENERS
The Red Wolves are 3-0 in home openers with ASU head coach John Brady at the Helm. The Red Wolves will also be looking to extend its 13-0 home winning streak in the process.
AT THE CONVO
Tonight's game will be the 326th men's basketball game at the Convocation Center. The Red Wolves are 236-89 (.724) all-time at the Convocation Center. ASU has gone undefeated at the convo on three occasions, in 1988-89 (14-0), 1990-91 (13-0) and 2010-11 (13-0).
PETERSON-HOOTEN LEAD THE WAY
Against Lamar, newcomer Marcus Hooten and junior Brandon Peterson led the way for the Red Wolves with 15 and 14 points respectively. Peterson also had eight rebounds to lead A-State and two blocks.
RECORD WATCH
Junior forward Brandon Peterson already has 92 blocked shots to his credit after blocking two against Lamar. Peterson ranks fourth on the all-time blocked shot list and needs 13 more to move into a tie for third. Freddy Hicks holds the school record for blocked shots with 204.
FIRST EXHIBITION
Arkansas State rolled to a 125-69 victory past Central Baptist in its exhibition opener that saw eight Red Wolves players score in double-digits. The squad was led by junior forward Brandon Peterson who had 20 points and 10 rebounds while junior college transfer Bryce Clark also poured in 20 points. Marcus Hooten, also a newcomer and JUCO transfer, scored 17 ranking third on the team. ASU continued its history of dominating the boards, outrebounding CBC 51-30 and scored 82 points in the paint. The Red Wolves shot 61.2% from the floor and 68% from free throw range.
SECOND EXHIBITION
Four Arkansas State players scored in double figures, including junior guard Marcus Hooten with a game-high 17 points, to lead the Red Wolves to an 80-55 victory over Henderson State Thursday night at the Convocation Center in a men's basketball exhibition game.
Hooten, who matched his point total in the Red Wolves' first exhibition game, was joined in double figures by Trey Finn with 14 points, Malcoln Kirkland with 13 and Ed Townsel with 12.  A senior forward, Kirkland also pulled down a game-high 10 rebounds to collect a double-double.
ASU shot 45 percent from the field while holding Henderson State to just 25 percent.  Behind Kirkland's 13 rebounds and five blocked shots, the Red Wolves also posted 11 more boards (57-46) and seven more blocks (10-3) than the Reddies.
RED WOLVES RETURNERS
ASU returns two starters from last year's squad which captured a share of the 2010-11 Sun Belt Conference Western division title.  ASU's top returning guard from last season, junior guard Trey Finn returns after averaging 8.7 points and 5.5 rebounds last season. Adams was named Sun Belt Conference Preseason All-Sun Belt First Team and Finn was named to the third team. Also returning for A-State is junior forward Brandon Peterson who averaged 7.9 points and 5.6 rebounds per game in 29 starts for the Red Wolves last season. Off the bench, ASU returns senior Malcoln Kirkland (4.8 ppg, 3.6 rpg), sophomore Ed Townsel  (4.8 ppg, 2.0 rpg), Adam Sterrenberg (3.5 ppg, 1.3 rpg) and Kinley Ogbonnyay-Branch (4.6 ppg, 0.9 rpg).
NEWCOMERS
The Red Wolves picked up some solid newcomers in the off season including three junior college transfers, a division I transfer and two true freshmen. Junior Marcus Hooten joins ASU being named NJCAA Honorable Mention All-American at Copiah-Lincoln. Hooten averaged 21.8 points per game last season for the Wolfpack. Also joining ASU from a junior college is junior Bryce Clark who played his freshman year at Houston and then transferred to Tinidad State as a sophomore where he averaged 16.0 points and 5.2 rebounds per game last season. Sophomore Jordan Weaver will also join ASU but will likely redshirt this season after playing last year at Iowa Western. Kendrick Washington played his first two seasons at Houston and will sit out this season due to the NCAA Division I transfer rule. Rakeem Dickerson and Johnny Zuppardo are true freshman for the Red Wolves. Dickerson, a guard, averaged 14.0 points and six assists a game at Brehm Prep leading his team to a 33-10 overall mark. Zuppardo joins ASU from St. Stanislaus where he averaged 17.0 points per game and led his team to a 4A State title as a senior.
UNDEFEATED AT HOME
For only the third time in the Convocation Center's history the Arkansas State men's basketball team completed regular season action undefeated at home in 2010-11. The Red Wolves posted a 13-0 record in Jonesboro this year. ASU is 236-89 record which amounts to a .724 winning percentage. This season was the first time since the 1990-91 season that the Red Wolves have held a perfect mark at the Convo.
PRESEASON ALL-CONFERENCE
ASU landed  junior guard Trey Finn on the All-Sun Belt Conference Preseason third team. Finn is one of the top returning players from last year's squad which went undefeated at home and won a share of the western division Sun Belt title. Finn is the top returning guard averaging 8.7 points and 5.5 rebounds a game during last season.
ON THE BENCH
For the second straight year, the Red Wolves will hold the distinction of being the only team currently playing in the NCAA with two former final four head coaches on the bench as assistant coach Richard Williams returns for his second season with ASU and Brady. The Red Wolves also hired Melvin Haralson as associate head coach in the offseason. Haralson was at Texas Southern last season after spending 10 years as an assistant and associate head coach at Houston. Jeff Clapacs also returns for his fourth season at Arkansas State as an assistant coach. Clapacs has been with Brady since his arrival at Arkansas State.
PRESEASON COACHES POLL
The Red Wolves were tabbed to finish atop the Sun Belt Conference West Division and received eight first place votes in the poll and 64 points overall. Louisiana-Lafayette finished second in the vote with two first place votes and 60 points. North Texas and Denver each received a first place vote finishing in third and fourth respectively with 50 and 40 points. UALR was tabbed fifth with 26 points and ULM was picked sixth with 12 points. FAU was nearly a unanimous pick to finish atop the east with 11 first place votes and 71 points. Middle Tennessee garnered the other first place vote with 59 points followed by WKU with 41 points, South Alabama with 33, FIU with 31 and Troy with 17.
HEAD COACH JOHN BRADY
Now in his fourth year with the program John Brady was announced as Arkansas State's 15th head men's basketball coach by Director of Athletics Dr. Dean Lee at a press conference held in ASU's Convocation Center on March 19, 2008.
In only three years at the helm of the program, Brady has turned the Red Wolves into a winner including capturing a share of the western division Sun Belt Conference Championship in 2010-11, posting double-digit Sun Belt Conference wins back-to-back for the first time in nearly 20 years and going undefeated at home with a 13-0 record.
During his first season with the Red Wolves, Brady helped lead ASU to one of the best starts in program history and achieved the No. 22 ranking on Collegeinsider.com's Mid-Major Top 25 poll. As a team ASU greatly improved its defending and rebounding, finishing near the top of the conference in several statistical categories.
Brady took a step further in his second season with The Red Wolves, improving their record to 17-14 and the team advanced to the semifinals of the Sun Belt Tournament finishing second in the west. Brady was named Sun Belt Coach of the Year and the District VII Coach of the Year by the USBWA. ASU led the league in three-point FG defense, rebounding offense and defensive rebounding.
ASU also posted an 11-7 SBC record this season which was its best league mark since the 2006-07 season when ASU achieved the same record. Its 11-wins was the seventh-time since ASU joined the Sun Belt that they have posted double-digit league wins.
Brady spent the last 10-plus seasons serving as LSU's head coach, leading the Tigers to six postseason berths, two SEC championships and three SEC Western Division titles. Twice named the SEC Coach of the Year,  Brady is a proven winner who has a well-documented record of success and a long list of accomplishments.
Brady's 16-year tenure as a head coach at both LSU and Samford in Birmingham, Alabama, has been decorated with achievements.  He has coached a combined 25 All-TAAC and SEC selections, 48 academic all-conference choices, posted 11 winning seasons and collected five division championships.  Brady piled up the third most wins in LSU history with 192 and left Samford after the 1996-97 season as the Bulldog's all-time leader in coaching victories (89) as well.
He quickly turned around an LSU's men's basketball program that had suffered four consecutive losing seasons prior to his arrival, leading the Tigers to a 28-6 record, an SEC championship and an NCAA Sweet 16 appearance in just his third season (1999-00) at the helm.  Under Brady's direction, the Tigers recorded six consecutive winning seasons from 2001-02 to 2006-07 while making three trips to the NCAA Tournament and two more to the NIT. The 2005-06 campaign saw LSU post a 27-9 record and advance to the Final Four for the first time in 20 years.
Not only did Brady coach the Tigers to 23 wins versus ranked opponents, he also led them to victories over two teams ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press Poll (Arizona in 2002-03 and Duke in 2005-06).  Additionally, he orchestrated a 19-game home winning streak over SEC opponents, the third longest stretch in LSU history.
While at LSU, Brady coached two NBA Lottery picks and six current NBA players.  The Tigers signed nine Parade All-Americans and four McDonald All-Americans under Brady, who also coached three SEC Players of the Year, four players named SEC Freshman of the Year, one SEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year and 17 All-SEC selections.
Prior to taking over the reigns at LSU, Brady served as Samford's head coach from 1991-92 through 1996-97.  It didn't take long for him to turn around a Samford program coming off six straight losing seasons, either, guiding the Bulldogs to a 17-10 record in his second season.  He led Samford to three straight winning seasons (1995-97) for the first time since 1982-84, all leading up to a 19-9 record and division title in 1997.  Samford won the TAAC West Division each of Brady's final two seasons at the school for the first time in school history.
His four winning campaigns at Samford were the first for any coach at the school, and he led the Bulldogs to an 89-77 record after they went 27-83 the four seasons prior to his initial year.  He coached eight All-TAAC and 14 Academic All-TAAC players over six seasons.
The McComb, Miss., native earned his bachelor's degree in 1976 from Belhaven College, where he was three-year starter and scored over 1,000 points during his college playing career.  Brady was a two-time All-Southern States Conference selection and was later inducted into his alma mater's Hall of Fame.
He got his coaching start as a graduate assistant with the Mississippi State men's basketball program while earning his master's degree from 1976-77.  Brady took his first head coaching position in Louisiana at Crowley High School in 1977 and led the basketball squad to a 129-49 (.725) record in five seasons.  He was named the 1981 Louisiana Sports Writers Association Class 3-A Coach of the Year.
Brady returned to the college coaching ranks in 1982 as an assistant coach at Mississippi State.  He spent the next eight years with the Bulldogs, the first four seasons under coach Bob Hoyt and the next four as a chief recruiter for coach Richard Williams.  Following his tenure in Starkville, Brady returned to Louisiana for the second time, this time to serve as an assistant coach at the University of New Orleans.  Brady helped lead UNO to the NCAA Tournament during his only season with the Privateers.
