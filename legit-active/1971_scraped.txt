They also recalled 20-year-old defenseman Tim Erixon, who flew into Stockholm that night and practiced Thursday morning at the Ericsson Globe on the Rangers’ third pairing alongside Steve Eminger.John Tortorella has not officially announced the roster for Friday’s night season opener against the Los Angeles Kings, but it is expected that Brendan Bell will be scratched as Dan Girardi and Ryan McDonagh play on the first pairing, Michael Sauer and Michael Del Zotto team on the second, and Erixon and Eminger back them up on the third.Have a question about the Blueshirts or a comment?
