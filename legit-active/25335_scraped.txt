Spiritualized – Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space                                lyrics
Take...the pain away Getting
strong today A
giant step each day All
I want in life's A
little bit of love to take the pain away Getting
strong today A
giant step each day I've
been told Only
fools rush in Only
fools rush in But
I don't believe I
don't believe I
could still fall in love with you I
will love you 'til I die And
I will love you all the time So
please put your sweet hand in mine And
float in space And
drift in time All
my time until I die We'll
float in space just you and I I
think I'll love you today I
guess that's what you get And
I don't know where we are all going to Life
don't get stranger than this But
it is what it is And
I don't know where we are all going to Everything
happens today And
we're out here to stay And
I don't know where we are all going to I
think I'll love you today I
guess that's what you get And
I don't know where we are all going to
