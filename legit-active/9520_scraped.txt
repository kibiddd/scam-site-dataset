He had a great senseof humor & was a caring, fun loving person.  He'd rather laugh than eat.During a visit back in the 90's he asked me to drive him down Old PelzerRd in Piedmont, S.C. across from the Estes Plant.  I did & during theride he spoke of his female high school bus driver (I can't remember hername but he did) & how he made an uncomplimentary statement about herbeing overweight & may cause the bridge to collapse as they were aboutto go over it.  Everyone on the bus had a big laugh at her expense.  Hecarried the inconsiderate remark over the years, never forgetting &always felt guilty for hurting her.  He still felt bad because he hadnever apologized.  We went past her Mother's house & he said "JiminyCrickets", she's outside doing yard work; pull in!  He couldn't get outof the car quick enough; she recognized him, they talked about oldtimes, he introduced me, then he very sincerely apologized with tears inhis eyes, about how remorseful he was & asked her to forgive him for therude comment he'd made years ago (he was about 13 at the time.)  Theyhugged & naturally she told him she forgave him years ago.  I realizedthat day that he had exceptional character, was honorable,compassionate, had a strong conscience (a God given gift), & proved thatit's never too late to attempt to right a wrong.Anyone that knew him (myself included) is a better person having knownhim.I love you Uncle Herb!  I'll see you there.Showing 1 - 2 of 2 resultsMake a Donation in Herbert Harris's namePlease consider a donation as requested by the family.Memorial Events for Herbert HarrisTo offer your sympathy during this difficult time, you can now have memorial trees planted in a National Forest in memory of your loved one.Plant TreesPlant TreesFuneral services provided by:Price-Helton Funeral Home731 W Main St, Auburn, WA 98001Call: 253-833-1165How to support Herbert's loved onesHonor a beloved veteran with a special tribute of ‘Taps’ at the National WWI Memorial in Washington, D.C.The nightly ceremony in Washington, D.C. will be dedicated in honor of your loved one on the day of your choosing.Read moreAttending a Funeral: What to KnowYou have funeral questions, we have answers.Read moreShould I Send Sympathy Flowers?What kind of arrangement is appropriate, where should you send it, and when should you send an alternative?Read moreWhat Should I Write in a Sympathy Card?We'll help you find the right words to comfort your family member or loved one during this difficult time.Read moreView AllResources to help you cope with lossEstate Settlement GuideIf you’re in charge of handling the affairs for a recently deceased loved one, this guide offers a helpful checklist.Read moreHow to Write an ObituaryNeed help writing an obituary?
