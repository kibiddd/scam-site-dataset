History
The town of Cass remains relatively unchanged since its founding in 1901 by the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company. Cass was built as a company town for the loggers who worked in the nearby mountains. Construction of the railroad started in 1901. It was used to haul lumber to the mill at Cass. The railroad track was eventually extended to the top of Bald Knob, the third highest mountain peak in West Virginia. In June 1942, the Cass operation was sold to Mower Lumber Company, which operated the town until July 1960, when the mill and railroad were shut down due to rapid decline of the timber industry in the region. In 1961, Cass was brought into the state parks system. In 1977, the company town also was made part of the parks system. Over the years, the railroad was turned into a tourist line and the town was repaired and restored. Today, the railroad is still in full operation, and is managed by the Durbin Greenbrier Valley Railroad.

Dining
Shays Restaurant
In an age where rugged wilderness country, unspoiled streams and steam locomotives are but memories, Cass Scenic Railroad State Park provides unique appeal. Shiny black “Shay” steam locomotives continue to go into deep forests, recreating for visitors what was commonplace in 1905. Youth, many of whom have never seen an “iron horse,” literally jump for joy; and adults find it easy to remember the bygone era of steam engines on American Railroads; as billowing clouds of black sulfurous-smelling coal smoke, a clear and melodic whistle, and the hiss of clean white steam announce the departure of the train. Before or following your train ride, enjoy a meal at “Shays” at Cass Scenic Railroad State Park.
