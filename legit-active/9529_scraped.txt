Many of the gadgets here look similar.  Nevertheless this solo effort of Snub Pollard is well worth seeing. Actually it's among the best he had done.  His usual overacting is not evident in this one,  and it also adds some becoming cartoon quality. The short length also helps, as he often seemed having difficulty to handle more than 10 minutes of screen time.  It really has some very creative ideas in the beginning.gelatofloOct 26, 2000PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 14, 1923 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesNoneEnglishAlso known asSnub der ErfinderProduction companyHal Roach StudiosSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime14 minutesColorBlack and WhiteSound mixSilentAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to It's a Gift (1923) in the United States?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
