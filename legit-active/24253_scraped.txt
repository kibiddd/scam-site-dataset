https://www.pennantchase.com/league..   We have 15/24 spots taken...Most everything is dialed in and ready to go in this new league.
College rules that are similar to here:
Top teams get top recruits.
Tournament format postseason
Shorter than MLB seasons
18-21 with redshirt options
new rules:
NIL money to improve "potential" and draw transfer recruits. (Also, ways to "earn" NIL money by being active)
a transfer portal for players that do not have starting spots on current team.
Possibly (not set up yet), a Discord page to increase involvement and add to the RPG part of the game.
I know you guys already appreciate the College Game...lol
