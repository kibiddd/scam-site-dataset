The Changing Face of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve
Martine Gravel
Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is a
borough of Montreal, located in the East end of the city. Since the 1980s, this
part of Montreal is often seen with a negative eye because of its high concentration
of poverty, even today and even though the area has changed significantly.
Image source: Flickr.For years, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve was
populated with prosperous citizens. In the days, during the 1920s, it had a
great concentration of factories that were very successful. Following the
1920s, factories began to close down and people deserted the area, which
eventually led to welfare and poverty. The neighbourhood had to face
prostitution, violence, crime and decaying apartments. Since the 80's, it has
been viewed as a bad neighbourhood, somewhere you do not wish to raise your
children and one without many cultural activities.
Recently, boroughs like the Plateau
Mont-Royal have become more and more popular, and the rents in those areas have
become unaffordable.  People who were living in the Plateau Mont-Royal look
elsewhere now to rent or purchase a house, and because the cost of living is
lower in Hochelaga, people are considering the area again, which has led to the
gentrification of the neighbourhood. More and more people from 25 to 40 years
old have moved to the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood and have directly
impacted its transformation.
From 2002 until now, I, off and on -
mostly on - have lived in the Hochelaga borough. During these years, many changes
have occurred. Condominiums were built, and the city invested millions in the
borough to improve its quality of life. For example, before, the only option
you had to get something to eat was hot dogs and fries in a snack bar. Now, you
have many more options such as bakeries and cheese shops. Even in grocery
stores, there is a much more diverse choice of products than before. In 2008,
the Place Valois was established. This public space has a fine french cuisine
restaurant called « Le Valois », a charming restaurant that is definitely worth
a visit! The ambiance is inviting and the food is tasty. There are also some
lovely little shops like « Arhoma Boulangerie Fromagerie » where you can buy
good tasting cheese and delicious breads, and specialty shops like « William J.
Walter » which serves fancy sausages and delicious ice cream. The Place Valois
also includes residential condominiums built for young professionals.
Another improvement of the
neighbourhood is on the cultural level. You can now visit a couple of art
galleries like « La Galerie FMR » located on Joliette street near Ontario. Just
a few steps away, there is also a welcoming video club, which is one of my
favorite places, called « Le Septième ». Their selection of movies is
awesome! They also serve coffee and have Internet access.
Even the name of the place changed.
After 2006, the word «HOMA» (short term for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve) appeared.
Probably to help sell condominiums and make the place sound more inviting.
Still, there is lots of prejudice about the neighbourhood and some people still
see it as a tough place. Nevertheless, it is now a neighbourhood with a great
diversity within its population, and I believe there is definitely a place for
everyone. As of today, the neighbourhood is still evolving and I enjoy living
there more and more. But will the place always be associated with poverty and
crime? Let's hope not!
