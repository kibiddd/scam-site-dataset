the 1930s and 1940s. He was born May 7, 1885, the third of seven
children, in the Hayes Hotel (owned by his father) in the tiny hamlet
of Stannards, New York, on the outskirts of Wellsville, New York. Hayes
was the son of hotelier and oil-production manager Clark Hayes, and
grew up in Stannards. As a young man, George Hayes worked in a circus
and played semi-pro baseball while a teenager. He ran away from home at
17, in 1902, and joined a touring stock company. He married Olive
Ireland in 1914 and the pair became quite successful on the vaudeville
circuit. Retired in his 40s, he lost much of his money in the 1929
stock market crash and was forced to return to work. Although he had
made his film debut in a single appearance prior to the crash, it was
not until his wife convinced him to move to California and he met
producer Trem Carr that he began working
steadily in the medium. He played scores of roles in Westerns and
non-Westerns alike, finally in the mid-1930s settling in to an almost
exclusively Western career. He gained fame as Hopalong Cassidy's
sidekick Windy Halliday in many films between 1936-39. Leaving the
Cassidy films in a salary dispute, he was legally precluded from using
the "Windy" nickname, and so took on the sobriquet "Gabby", and was so
billed from about 1940. One of the few sidekicks to land on the annual
list of Top Ten Western Boxoffice Stars, he did so repeatedly. In his
early films, he alternated between whiskered comic-relief sidekicks and
clean-shaven bad guys, but by the later 1930s, he worked almost
exclusively as a Western sidekick to stars such as
John Wayne,
Roy Rogers, and
Randolph Scott. After his last
film, in 1950, he starred as the host of a network television show
devoted to stories of the Old West for children,
The Gabby Hayes Show (1950).
Offstage an elegant and well-appointed connoisseur and man-about-town,
Hayes devoted the final years of his life to his investments. He died
of cardiovascular disease in Burbank, California, on February 9, 1969.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>FamilySpouseOlive E. Ireland(March 4, 1914 - July 5, 1957) (her death)TrademarksCatchphrases "yer durn tootin" and "young whipper snapper""Old Prospector" styleRoles in westernsTriviaIn real life he was the exact opposite of the characters he played on
film. He was well read, well-groomed, serious and highly
philosophical.The character of Gabby Johnson in Blazing Saddles (1974) is a tribute to Hayes.Western sidekicks Hayes and Smiley Burnette were so popular with
audiences that they consistently placed in "top 10" box-office cowboy
star polls alongside Gene Autry and Roy Rogers..Though a long-time western star, he didn't learn to ride a horse until he was 50 years old.Whenever he made a solo personal appearance as his "Gabby" character, he would attract crowds as large as stars such as Gene Autry or Roy Rogers.10 moreAllQuotes[on John Wayne] He's my boy. He's the best. Couldn't think
more of him if he was my own son.[on westerns] I hate 'em. Really can't stand 'em. They always are the same. You have so few plots--the stagecoach holdup, the rustlers, the mortgage gag, the mine setting and the retired gunslinger.
