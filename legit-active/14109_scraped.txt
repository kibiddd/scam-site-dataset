The 27-year-old's recent interview with the Ottawa Citizen newspaper, in advance of her August 11 performance near the Canadian capital, apparently didn't go as well as the country superstar had hoped, due to the reporter's concentration of rifles over records."Dear mr writer at Ottawa citizen: next time u interview me, let's keep it about the music and not about your view on my stance on guns," she tweets (in Twitter-speak). "I don't talk politics period. I'm Not sure all Canadians would like to Be put in your category. Speak for yourself not your country. Thx!"The new bride of Blake Shelton, who enjoyed her first Top 10 single with the self-penned tune 'Gunpowder & Lead,' has been a longtime supporter of the right to bear arms. "I would say two, actually three," she recommends, regarding how many guns should be in every household. "I think you have a pistol, a shotgun and a rifle because that covers the spectrum of what you're going to need to hunt. I'm a gun-toter and I believe in guns -- not for violent reasons, just because it's our right to have one. Also, I'm a hunter so I have to have some."Miranda's next solo album, 'Four the Record,' will hit shelves on November 1. But first, we'll hear the debut from her new trio, Pistol Annies, as they're set to release their self-titled CD on August 23. Watch the ladies' brand-new video for 'Hell on Heels' below.In addition to Miranda's upcoming show in Canada, the reigning ACM and CMA Top Female Vocalist will head to New Hampshire, Nevada and California this summer.
