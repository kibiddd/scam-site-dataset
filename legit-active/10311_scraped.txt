How We Do It
Our Data
Strong performance starts with quality data. We obtain first-party data through our owned and operated (and top rated!) app, WeatherBug, third-party data through partnerships, and bid stream data from our media supply partnerships.
Blueprints
Blueprints are the foundation of GroundTruth’s ability to create and reach unique audience segments based on real-world behaviors that can be reached across multiple media channels. Blueprints also makes it possible to measure how consumers respond to advertising campaigns, including if they physically showed up to a location or visited a website, to understand the real business results generated by a brand's advertising.
Let's chat about how GroundTruth can help you drive real business results.
