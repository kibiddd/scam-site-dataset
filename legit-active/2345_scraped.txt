Since his debut album in the 1960s, Jackson Browne has been one of the
most respected and legendary singer-songwriters in the history of American
music. Browne earned his first big hit with the 1972 single “Doctor My
Eyes,” and over the course of his lauded songwriting career, many more
memorable folk-rock hits have become staples of his live shows. Combining
poetic lyrics with clear, simple melodies, Browne amplified classic rock
songwriting on iconic tracks like “The Pretender,” “Running on Empty,”
“These Days,” “Take It Easy,” and many more. When you have the chance to
attend the latest Jackson Browne tour, don’t miss out on your opportunity

performing on his own or supporting one of his fellow classic rock icons,
