This, however, could be interpreted as intentional by the director, who was parodying non-Western interpretations of a "western" (other countries who partake in a love of westerns are Thailand and Cambodia). The child in this scene is also wearing a Nike shirt. The effect is to present the sort of low-budget, pulp film one might see in a television broadcast in Mali, while supplying a metaphor to the actual movie's plot.QuotesAvocat partie civile: We cannot throw Paul Wolfowitz into the Niger. The caimans wouldn't want him.User reviews20ReviewFeatured review5/10Good Points, but Dubiously pitched and AesthetizisedBamako is more a PBS special than a flat out film. It chronicles a trial in which the World Bank is on trial itself. The film is quite anti Bush-era corporate interests (IMF, World Bank, and G8 are among the villains name-checked), but through the film (I don't even know what it is, a doc. or a film) comes the film maker's true anger which is surprisingly stimulated. In between the quasi-entertaining court-room arguments and the callous shots of town, there isn't much room to inhale pure film making. (There's even a bizarre mock-movie staring Danny Glover as in assassin in a haphazard African town.) And yet, despite the film's slog, there's something in Bamako that keeps it quietly vital, making it a true case of moral politics but pretty much a slog of a film.za-andresMar 13, 2007PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ15How long is Bamako (The Court)?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 18, 2006 (France)Countries of originFranceMaliUnited StatesLanguagesFrenchBambaraEnglishHebrewAlso known asBamako (The Court)Filming locationsBamako, MaliProduction companiesArchipel 33Chinguitty FilmsMali ImagesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget€2,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$112,351Opening weekend US & Canada$10,183Feb 18, 2007Gross worldwide$1,059,232See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 55 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the English language plot outline for Bamako (2006)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
