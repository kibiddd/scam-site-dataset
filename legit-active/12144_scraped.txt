Literature Before 1900 Trivia Questions
1. In 1851, Herman Melville published "Moby Dick".  Of the many members of the crew of the whaling ship the "Pequod", only one survives.  Who is it?
From Quiz Bigger Than Ben-Hur
Answer: Ishmael
If I had mentioned the famous opening line "Call me Ishmael", that might have been a tip-off.  Captain Ahab's obsessive pursuit of Moby Dick, the whale who destroyed his lower leg on a previous voyage, eventually leads to the deaths of all of his crew except for the narrator, Ishmael.  At least Starbuck would lend his name to a Seattle-based chain of coffee shops.
2. In the late 14th century Arthurian Romance 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight', Sir Gawain took shelter in a Green Castle while pursuing the Green Knight. Who was the actual lord of the Green castle?
From Quiz Mysterious Middle Age
Answer: Bertilak
In the Arthurian Romance 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight', Gawain traveled through the wilderness of northwest Britain in search of the Green Knight. He encountered all sorts of beasts, suffered from hunger and cold, and at last saw a Green Chapel and took shelter there. He stayed there for three days and received cordial hospitality. At the end the Green Knight revealed his true identity. He disclosed that he was Bertilak, the actual lord of the castle.
3. Jim Hawkins ends up on an island with hidden treasure in it where they are betrayed by most of their crew - who turn out to be pirates! Which book is this?
From Quiz Classic Literature
Answer: "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson
"Treasure Island" is the book. "Pirates Ashore!" by Jim Henders and "Hidden Treasure" by Robin Clears are fake.
In "Treasure Island", Jim Hawkins sets out with some friends and a crew to Treasure Island. When they have arrived, most of the crew members turn out to be pirates led by Long John Sliver. They end up staying on shore while the pirates stay on the ship, waiting for Jim and his friends to give up the map to Treasure Island.
4. "My dress is silver, shimmering gray, spun with a blaze of garnets.
I craze most men: rash fools I run on a road of rage,
And cage quiet determined men.
Why they love me--lured from mind, stripped of strength--remains a riddle."
Who am I?
From Quiz Riddles (Anglo-Saxon Style)
Answer: Wine
The silver dress is the wine goblet, which was often adorned with precious stones, such as garnets.  The alcohol in the wine makes men crazy, rash, and full of rage.  Though the wine strips men of their strength (the worst thing possible in such a macho world), men still love it.  Some things never change.
5. This novel by one of the most important French poets is about the life of Jean Valjean. It is also about poverty and education. It was published in 1862.  Which great novel is it?
From Quiz Great Romantic Books and Authors
Answer: Les Miserables
"Les Miserables", first released on 1862, talks about the life of Jean Valjean, who tries to reconstruct his life after being twenty years in prison.
6. This is a story about love, self-deception, religious feeling, innocence, and experience. Its main character is a carpenter, and in its pages we meet a female Methodist preacher.
From Quiz Great Literature Miscellany
Answer: Adam Bede
Though most known for "Middlemarch," George Eliot provides a penetrating psychological portrait of her varied characters in "Adam Bede."
7. Jane Austen did NOT write:
From Quiz Who Didn't Write It?
Answer: Agnes Grey
Austen did not write "Agnes Grey", which comes from the pen of Anne Bronte, sister to Charlotte and Emily Bronte.  Of the three Bronte sisters, Anne's writing most nearly resembles Austen's.  It is less Gothic than that of her sisters.  Austen's "Northanger Abbey" is actually a parody on the kinds of Gothic novels Charlotte and Emily would later write.
8. Which Bronte wrote 'Agnes Grey'?
From Quiz Mixed Literature
Answer: Anne
'Wuthering Heights' was Emily Bronte's only novel. Charlotte Bronte wrote 'The Professor', 'Villette', 'Shirley' and 'Jane Eyre'. There is no Jane Bronte.
9. One of the earliest prose works in English is the anonymous work 'Ancrene Riwle', the title of which can be translated to modern English as 'Rule for _____'. What does 'Ancrene' mean?
From Quiz Early English Prose
Answer: Anchoresses
Anchoresses were religious recluses who lived in enclosures attached to a church. For example Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe (see question 3). Like most early prose 'Ancrene Riwle' is a religious work.
10. 'So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by And the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns.'
From Quiz English Literature Before 1800
Answer: Beowulf
The present translation is by the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1995.
11. What is the name of the river that Lazarillo is born in?
From Quiz Lazarillo De Tormes
Answer: Tormes
12. In Homer's 'The Odyssey', what is the name of Odysseus' son?
From Quiz Mostly European Literature
Answer: Telemachus
Telemachus was the firstborn of Odysseus and Penelope. He proved himself an intelligent, strong and brave young man by the end of the epic, and worthy of being his father's son.
13. Who is the author of the Gothic novel, 'Dracula'?
From Quiz Authors of the Classics
Answer: Bram Stoker
14. Time: 'Too slow for those who wait Too swift for those who fear Too long for those who grieve Too short for those who rejoice But for those who love Time is not' (Low they be but the sea shall not claim them)
From Quiz Mixed Literature Rather Tough But ?
Answer: Henry Van Dyke
The dykes of the Netherlands.
15. 'All for one, one for all' is the motto of which fictional heroes?
From Quiz Literature, generally
Answer: The Three Musketeers
Porthos, Athos and Aramis, were the three musketeers in the books by Alexandre Dumas.
16. Leo Tolstoy's sprawling epic "War and Peace" (1869) tells about the effects of war on Russia.  Which war is the focus of the novel?
From Quiz Bigger Than Ben-Hur
Answer: The Napoleonic Wars
Covering the years 1805-1812, Napoleon's invasion of Russia is a major focus of the book.  I actually read the entire book once, but found it hard to keep track of the literally hundreds of fictional characters and historical figures that appear throughout the book.  In the end, I compromised by picking one significant character and focusing on him for the last half of the book.
17. In the Middle English romance 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight', when Gawain reached the Green Chapel, the lord of the castle greeted him warmly and introduced him to his lady and to the old woman who was sitting beside her. Who was the old woman?
From Quiz Mysterious Middle Age
Answer: Morgan le Faye
The old woman at the castle was Morgan le Faye. She was Gawain's aunt and King Arthur's half sister. She sent the Green Knight on his original errand and used her magic to change Bertilak's appearance. She wanted to test King Arthur and his Knights and, as such, framed the whole episode. 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' was a late 14th century verse romance.
18. D'Artagnan has a letter stolen which could have made him a musketeer. Promising revenge on the person who stole it, he sets out to become a musketeer and makes three friends along the way. Name this book.
From Quiz Classic Literature
Answer: "The Three Musketeers" by Alexandre Dumas
"Revenge Is Mine" by Count Flanders is not real. The rest are real stories, but the correct answer is "The Three Musketeers".
D'Artagnan sets out to become a musketeer when his letter is stolen by a man he calls "The Man of Meung". He meets three musketeers along the way: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who become his friends. In the course of events, Cardinal Richelieu - their enemy - plots against them since they are helping the Queen and her friend, Madame Bonacieux.
19. "A wonderful warrior exists on earth.
Two dumb creatures make him grow bright between them.
Enemies use him against one another.
His strength is fierce but a woman can tame him."
Who is this warrior?
From Quiz Riddles (Anglo-Saxon Style)
Answer: Fire
The "warrior" is fire.  The fire is created when two sticks (i.e., "two dumb creatures") are rubbed together.  Fire was often used to burn the towns and homes of enemies. However, it could be put out by anyone--even a woman!
(University of Aberdeen, http://www.abdn.ac.uk/english/beowulf/riddle.htm)
20. This long poem presents the Romantic subject of piracy. This author died in Missolonghi fighting in the Greek Independence War. Which poem are we talking about?
From Quiz Great Romantic Books and Authors
Answer: The Corsair
"The Corsair" is considered the first book that talked about piracy as a Romantic dream.  The author was George Gordon Byron, who died in Missolonghi fighting against Turkey for the independence of Greece.
21. What characteristics do the authors of "The Castle of Otranto", "The Monk", and "Vathek" have in common?
From Quiz Gothic Literature
Answer: They were all suspected of being homosexual.
All were suspected of being homosexual: Horace Walpole (author of "Castle of Otranto") never married; Matthew Lewis (author of "The Monk") had rumours about his preferences for most of his life; and William Beckford (author of "Vathek") was caught in bed with his male cousin.
22. In Sophocle's "Antigone," who, because of his pride, repents too late and must endure the deaths of those closest to him?
From Quiz Great Literature Miscellany
Answer: Creon
Creon must ultimately suffer for his own flaw, and in this sense he could be viewed as the tragic hero of the play. Antigone, on the other hand, triumphs even in death. Oedipus is a character appearing in two other plays by Sophocles.
23. Charles Dickens did NOT write:
From Quiz Who Didn't Write It?
Answer: The House of Seven Gables
The American Nathaniel Hawthorne was the author of "The House of Seven Gables".  Interestingly, Dickens died while writing "Edwin Drood", so the mystery was never concluded, though we can deduce the murderer from the book as well as from the author's notes.
24. What is the first name of Miss Everdene in Thomas Hardy's 'Far from the Madding Crowd'?
From Quiz Mixed Literature
Answer: Bathsheba
Gabriel Oak, the main character in the story, fell in love with Bathsheba.
25. 'In a summer season when the sun was mild I clad myself in clothes as I'd become a sheep; In the habit of a hermit unholy of works, Walked wide in this world, watching for wonders.'
From Quiz English Literature Before 1800
Answer: 'The Vision of Piers Plowman' (by William Langland)
The translation is by E.T. Donaldson and is based on 'Piers Plowman: The B Version', edited by George Kane and E.T. Donaldson.
26. Who is the first person that Lazarillo goes to live with?
From Quiz Lazarillo De Tormes
Answer: a blind man
27. Madame de Lafayette's 'The Princesse of Cleves' is a tale of failed romance and court deception, and many of the characters in the novel die. Who is the first to pass on?
From Quiz Mostly European Literature
Answer: The princess' mother, Mme de Chartres
Mme de Chartres' dying words to her daughter foreshadowed the rest of the novel: she begged the princess not to fall in love with the duke. It would eventually be her downfall.
28. Who wrote 'Northanger Abbey'?
From Quiz Authors of the Classics
Answer: Jane Austen
This book was not actually published until 1818, after Austen's death.
29. 'Who with a little cannot be content, Endures an everlasting punishment'.
