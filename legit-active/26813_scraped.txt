#Cyber school is in session. 🔒
Following the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) request, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) developed requirements within the critical infrastructure protection (CIP) reliability standards for internal network security monitoring (INSM). Once approved, it gives 36 months to high- and medium-impact facilities with external routable connectivity (ERC) control centers for implementation and 60 months to other medium-impact facilities with ERC for implementation.
Join this upcoming #LinkedInLive event as our expert panelists guide facilities on how to prepare for the new requirement.
RSVP below! 📩
Speakers: Anirban Ghosh | Shelby Brooks | Benjamin Stirling | Christopher Walcutt, CISM, CISSP
Moderator: Keon McEwen

Charleston communities have continued to experience frequent flooding even as the city has worked steadfastly to manage it. 💧
To address the issue, Charleston has been shifting its flood control and #RiskMitigation approach with the help of our team.
Together, we have implemented the Charleston Water Plan providing a 25-year framework for:
💦 Controlling #FloodRisks from tides, sea level rise, stormwater, storm surge, and #groundwater.
🌿 Guiding safe and resilient growth while protecting ecologically sensitive areas.
🏙 Embracing the connection between water and the city’s historic sense of place.

The average person might not think water is particularly important to #mining, but it's absolutely crucial.
In celebration of #WorldWaterDay last weekend, our Garrick Field published a piece in Indonesia’s national newspaper, The Jakarta Post. Garrick observed how Indonesia’s policies are spurring significant growth in the mining and metals processing industry, yet few know that mining accounts for 30% of the country’s industrial water use.
#WaterInfrastructure assets can often be overtaken by other concerns on a mining company’s priority list, but water is critical to the reliability and productivity of mine sites, and simple asset management programs can save millions of dollars for the industry.
As Garrick points out, “Mining companies often miss a simple step to protect the value of their operation through improving the management of their water assets. This is a huge opportunity for new and emerging mining companies in Indonesia, in particular, so that the value of the investments in water infrastructure is maximized and preserved for the country over the long term.”

Honoring Her! 🙌
Our Women's Advancement, Vision and Empowerment (WAVE) #ERG offered a number of opportunities to celebrate #InternationalWomensDay this year.
WAVE proudly hosted Mallory Martin, CEO of The Mended Company and an International Justice Mission (IJM) ambassador, as well as Kristy Childs, founder of Veronica's Voice, which is now part of REHOPEorg, to discuss not only the impact of human trafficking, but how to #AccelerateAction against this modern form of slavery.
Additionally, women in our India offices held an event that included gifts, sweets and a vibrant atmosphere where everyone shared stories that highlighted the strength and resiliency of women. Fun-filled games fostered a sense of camaraderie and allowed everyone to appreciate each other. 🙂
Thank you to WAVE for organizing these events!
“Honoring Her” isn't just a day —it is a movement, a reminder to celebrate the women in our lives every day. #WomensHistoryMonth

For critical infrastructure, #cybersecurity should be an integral part of project planning and design.
Rather than retrofitting cyber defenses at the end of a project, a ""security by design"" approach incorporates them from the outset.
Our perspective outlines six steps that critical #infrastructure owners and operators should consider for building a strong #OTcybersecurity foundation: http://ms.spr.ly/6045qXNiF
