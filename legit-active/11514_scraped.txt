INTRODUCTION
This article is written to
pinpoint the timing of the imminent hyperinflation. Statements
are backed up with facts. Inferences are drawn from repeated
past occurrences supported with reasons. Readers should not swallow
my findings; they are encouraged to verify the facts presented.
The findings are the results of my private research work over
25 years.
There may be many people like
me trying to unlock the mysteries of the Universe, but I am alone
in this piece of research work.
THE GOOSE THAT LAYS
GOLD EGGS
Please look at some figures:
Year 1781 was hyperinflationary.
The American Revolutionary War rendered the continental currency
valueless. On 31 May 1781, Gold price soared to $19,390 an ounce.
The goose had laid her first Gold egg!
The figure 1781.40 (2nd quarter in year 1781) is a starting reference
point for computing subsequent events. The height of a crisis
may deviate from the reference point by several months because
a crisis spans months or even years.
THE GOLD EGGS
Gold egg
No. 2 [1837 Q1]
Here are some important events
in the history of Gold:
2 April 1792
28 June 1834
10 May 1837
10 May 1838
Gold was fixed
at $19.39 an ounce under Gold Standard.
Gold price was raised to $20.67 an ounce.
Suspension of free conversion of money into Gold.
Free conversion was re-instated.
After 55.80 years, because
of financial panic and huge demand for Gold, the U.S. government
suspended free Gold conversion. The 2nd Gold egg was laid in
May 1837.
Gold egg No. 3 [1893 Q1]
55.80 years later, in 1893,
another financial panic occurred. Gold was hoarded. In October,
the discount rate soared to 36%.
John Dennis Brown's 101
Years on Wall Street made the following comments:
The last great mercantile
and credit crisis of the nineteenth century smashed the market
in
1893. During the summer, the casualty list included a fast-swelling
list of banks, insurance companies, and brokers. Cash currency
commanded a premium of 5% over certified checks.
The nation, at the same
time, suffered from a growing currency
crisis originating in the
Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 and driven by a growing foreign distrust of dollar holdings.
Heavy selling of securities encouraged the efflux of Gold
and the Treasury's bullion holdings fell dramatically.
Gold egg No. 4 [1948 Q4]
This egg was laid immediately
after World War II. The following events make interesting reading:
Hungary 1946
The inflation rate was 19,800% per month.
In August 1946, 828 octillion (1 followed by 27 zeroes) depreciated
pengos equaled the value of 1 pre-war pengo.
Japan 1947
Fishermen & farmers in 1947 used scales to weigh currency
and change.
China 1946-1948
The Chinese National currency became valueless (when the National
Party was expelled to Taiwan).
Gold egg No. 5
The reference point of the
coming crisis is the 3rd quarter in 2004! The crisis peak may
deviate from the reference point by several months. In a separate
analysis (as I will explain later), I have arrived at the conclusion
that the most turbulent months will be in year 2005. During this
period, Gold and Silver prices will soar. So will commodities.
Before moving to the next section,
let me recapitulate:
THE UNDERLYING CAUSE
I read a novel City Boundary
by Qian Zhong-shu. In the preface, Mr. Qian told a story. An
English woman read the English version and was keenly interested.
She telephoned Qian and asked whether the chief character in
the novel was Qian himself. Qian replied bluntly, "If you
like the egg, eat it. Why are you bothering me with the hen?"
Dear readers, if you like the
gold egg, pick it up and keep it in a safe place. As to the goose...
er... Since you want to know why she lays a Gold egg every 55.80
years, I am telling you the underlying cause now.
People in weather forecasting
business know well that there is a lunar cycle of 18.60 years.
The knowledge is an indispensable tool for predicting water tides.
Three times 18.60 years = 55.80 years. It so happened that in
every 3rd occurrence of this 18.60-year lunar cycle, momentous
events had occurred to bring into prominence Gold's role in the
financial markets.
The following is an explanation
for the formation of the 18.60-year lunar cycle:
The Earth revolves around the
Sun. The plane of the Earth's orbit is called the Ecliptic. The
Moon's orbit (around the Earth) is inclined 5 degrees 8 minutes
to the Ecliptic. The point where the Moon crosses the Ecliptic
from south to north is called the North Node, and where the Moon
crosses the Ecliptic from north to south is called the South
Node. The two nodes (180 degrees apart) move in clockwise direction
and complete one circle of 360 degrees in 18.60 years.
For nodal and planetary positions,
please refer to The American Ephemeris by Neil
F. Michelsen. (Amazon)
THE 18.60-YEAR CYCLE
AND EFFECTS ON GOLD AND CURRENCY
What had happened on the shorter
cycle of 18.60 years?
The effects, though regional
only, were the same. Currency collapsed, and Gold was in great
demand, as evidenced below:
FINANCIAL PANIC
Knowing that hyperinflation
is approaching, we have no difficulty to get into a long Gold
&/or Silver position. The important decision is when to sell
so to maximize profits at or close to the peak. In a spiraling
inflationary period, fortunes can be made or lost within a short
time. It is crucial to know beforehand when to liquidate the
long positions.
I need to state a theory discovered
by me. It has not been disclosed to anybody until now.
Theory
"When lunar node is posited
alongside Jupiter for a long time, there is hyperinflation."
Notes:
Lunar node = North Node or
South Node
Alongside Jupiter = Close to Jupiter, not more than 14 degrees
apart.
Long time = More than 6 months.
To illustrate the application
of this theory, let us study the last soaring Gold market in
1979-1980.
The positions of North Node
and Jupiter are taken from The American Ephemeris.
When North Node was on the
positive side of Jupiter, it lasted only 2 months, so the formation
had no application. When North Node was on the negative side
of Jupiter, they stayed within orb for more than 7 months. Accordingly
the period from early November 1979 through end June 1980 was
extremely bullish for Gold.
Spot Gold was quoted at US$370
an ounce in early November 1979. It soared to US$875 on 21 January
1980. There was a sharp downward reaction in February and March
1980, touching a low of US$475. Gold then climbed all the way
up during the rest of the bullish phase. Its price overshot past
the end of June 1980, reaching US$690 in early July.
The period from early November
1979 through end June 1980 was only a part (the most bullish
part) of the financial panic. The bullish Gold trend started
much earlier.
There is an equally bullish
phase for Gold in the near future.
South Node is on the opposite
side of North Node (the lunar nodes are always 180 degrees apart).
Interactions between South Node and Jupiter are the same as interactions
between North Node and Jupiter. Bear in mind that Libra is opposite
to Aries.
When South Node is in the positive
side of Jupiter, they stay within orb for about 8 months. Therefore
the period from end December 2004 through early August 2005 is
extremely bullish for Gold. South Node then swings to the negative
side of Jupiter, and this lasts only 2 months. The latter formation
has no application. I expect termination of the bullish trend
from the last week of August 2005.
The bullish period from end
December 2004 through early August 2005 is only a part (the most
bullish part) of the financial panic. The bullish trend for Gold
will start much earlier.
A FORECAST FOR GOLD
AND SILVER
It is not the purpose of this
article to make any guesses. However, from the facts presented,
I believe that during the impending hyperinflation, Gold prices
will explode, exceeding significantly the peak achieved in January
1980 (US$875 an ounce) because:
(a) The
astronomical phenomena for 2004-2005 are at least as bullish
as those for 1979-1980.
(b) In
the past occasion, Gold started with a low of US$100 per ounce
in August 1976. The current
occasion had a low of US$252 in August 1999. It is not unreasonable
to expect a much higher peak for the present bullish market.
The next problem is to consider
whether or not to buy Silver as well.
The Gold/Silver ratio was 16
for many years before 1870. The ratio rose to 90 in 1930s (Great
Depression). From 1960 to 1980 (inflationary periods), it fluctuated
between 20 and 40. The latest low was 20 in end 1979-early 1980.
The ratio rose to 100 in 1991 Q1. It now stands at 70.
It is clear that during inflationary
periods, Gold/Silver ratios fall. Since the coming great event
is hyperinflation, I expect the ratio to fall to 20-40 (like
years 1960 to 1980) which is about half of the current ratio
of 70. This means that for 100% rise in Gold (Gold price is doubled),
Silver will rise 300% (Silver price is quadrupled). On this reasoning,
I would advise buying Silver also.
CONCLUSION
Here are the main points:
1. Hyperinflation is imminent.
2. Past analyses indicate the
following will happen:
Gold will soar.
U.S. dollars will collapse.
Interest rates will climb sharply.
3. The reference point for
the hyperinflation is the 3rd quarter of 2004. By planetary correlations,
the most bullish phase has been located. It is from end December
2004 through early August 2005. However, Gold will rise significantly
before this period.
4. Gold price will greatly
surpass the high reached in year 1980.
5. It is advisable to invest
in Silver also because Silver rises more rapidly than Gold.
6. Hyperinflationary forces
will disintegrate by the end of August 2005.
Good luck!
