Vancouver indie-dance duo Humans has just released a video for “The End.” The clip, inspired by horror films such as The Fly, Evil Dead 2, Dead Alive and The Thing, was directed and produced by band member Peter Ricq. The music was written specifically for the short film and documents a picnic in the woods that goes terribly wrong. Check out the man-eating “The End” below.
