Bannister Mall
Bannister Mall was a shopping mall in the southeast corner of Kansas City, Missouri opened on August 6, 1980. After nearly 27 years of operation, the mall closed on May 31, 2007. It was originally anchored by Dillard's (formerly Macy's), JCPenney, The Jones Store, and Sears.
History
Bannister Mall was built and opened in August 1980 at 5600 Bannister Road in Kansas City, Missouri between I-435 and Hillcrest Road. The area was once the site of the Three Trails (Santa Fe, California, and Oregon) and the Santa Fe trail actually crossed the original property. The mall was one of the largest malls in the Kansas City area and in the region in a previously vital and vibrant shopping area. In the early 1980s, Bannister Mall was the "place to go" with a draw over a large area that was mostly from South Kansas City, suburban Jackson County, Missouri, and Johnson County, Kansas. In 1988-1990, an area north and east of the mall called Benjamin Plaza was added to the commercial retail area.

The Last Visit to Bannister Mall in Kansas City Missouri - 05/17/2007
I was looking through my old hard drive and came across the rest of the images and video footage I had taken on our last visit to Bannister Mall in South Kansas City, Missouri. We had taken one last trip to reminisce before it was closed two weeks later on May 31, 2007, and then subsequently demolished two years later in 2009.
I had to convert all of the old file footage and finally got everything to work. Including the pictures and video files, this mini-documentary is about nine minutes long. It is narrated with some informational data as well as some personal memories of the mall.

"Bannister Mall was a shopping mall on the southeast corner of Kansas City, Missouri that closed on May 31, 2007, after being open for almost 27 years. The site will be reused for a new Kansas City Wizards soccer stadium
Bannister Mall was built and opened in August 1980 at 5600 Bannister Road in Kansas City, Missouri between I-435 and Hillcrest Road. The area was once the site of the Three Trails (Santa Fe, California, and Oregon). The mall was one of the largest malls in the Kansas City area in a previously vital and vibrant shopping area. In the early 1980s, Bannister Mall was the "place to go" with a draw over a large area that was mostly from South Kansas City, Jackson County, Missouri, and Johnson County, Kansas. In 1988-1990, an area north and east of the mall called Benjamin Plaza was added to the commercial retail area. In 1995, the mall was one of two final candidates to host the filming of Kevin Smith's film Mallrats, but when the management objected to the script[citation needed], the Eden Prairie Center in Eden Prarie, Minnesota was chosen instead.
By the mid to late 1990s with newer and better deployments further south and in Johnson County Kansas, the area began to wane. Also, due to consistent white flight, the area around Bannister Mall earned a bad reputation as being a high crime area. This combination led to the present blight of the area. By 2005, three of the four anchor stores in the mall were gone. Bannister Mall once hosted 180 stores, but by 2007 only 50 stores were open.
In April 2007, it was announced that due low population and rising costs of operation that the mall would close. At the time, only half of the mall was open, with the northern part blocked off. The failure of the mall is largely due to migration to the suburbs and the general demise of the indoor mall concept. The only new construction in the area is the replacement of the Kansas City Fire Department's Fire Station 41, which once was facing Bannister Road and now is facing Hillcrest Road. Even the nearby Wal-Mart Supercenter closed in January 2007, which was a day before a new Wal-Mart opened on the site of the former Blue Ridge Mall now called Blue Ridge Crossing.[2] The Bannister Wal-Mart was one of the company's earliest Hypermart stores[3], but it later changed to the Supercenter format. At the end of May 2007, Bannister Mall closed its doors.
Demolition of the mall began on January 21, 2009. The demolition is expected to take four months to complete.[4] As of July 2009, very little of the mall remained, and it is no longer standing. The site will be redeveloped as The Trails and will include a new stadium for the Kansas City Wizards, twelve soccer fields for tournaments, 1,500,000 square feet (139,000 m2) of office space, and one million square feet of retail space. The redevelopment is being financed partly through $230 million in local tax increment financing approved by the Kansas City Council and $30 million in state tax credits from the state of Missouri."

I filmed this testing out a new digital camera on May 17, 2007. This was two weeks before Bannister Mall permanently closed its doors. It was torn down in 2009. I wish I had recorded more footage.

Bannister Mall
Bannister Mall was a shopping mall in the southeast corner of Kansas City, Missouri opened on August 6, 1980. After nearly 27 years of operation, the mall closed on May 31, 2007. It was originally anchored by Dillard's (formerly Macy's), JCPenney, The Jones Store, and Sears.
History
Bannister Mall was built and opened in August 1980 at 5600 Bannister Road in Kansas City, Missouri between I-435 and Hillcrest Road. The area was once the site of the Three Trails (Santa Fe, California, and Oregon) and the Santa Fe trail actually crossed the original property. The mall was one of the largest malls in the Kansas City area and in the region in a previously vital and vibrant shopping area. In the early 1980s, Bannister Mall was the "place to go" with a draw over a large area that was mostly from South Kansas City, suburban Jackson County, Missouri, and Johnson County, Kansas. In 1988-1990, an area north and east of the mall called Benjamin Plaza was added to the commercial retail area.
