Although actors were mic'd, it probably wasn't necessary since the acoustics were great and theatre is small.  Keep in mind, I'm an avid NYC theater goer, so comparing to a much larger scale.  My husband & I saw "Strawberries in January" and it was exceptional.  We support live performances often, so was pleasantly surprised, this being our 1st of hopefully many, Montreal shows.  The 4 actors were very talented, as well as, the musicians playing above.  It was a beautiful show in a charming space!Read moreWritten January 24, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

No longer what Podbrey and others created.Sep 2024 • FriendsSadly Centaur continues its downhill slide. There were many good years in the past but under the new artistic director we have seen in recent years a reduction in number of plays in the season subscription while costs are high and the plays themselves are lacking the excitement and variety of the past. There used to be an incentive to subscribe with bring a friend passes but that too is a thing of the past. This most recent presentation is a further example that nothing is moving in the right direction. The play was dull and the acting lacked energy.  One positive aspect was the excellent stage design. The artistic director claimed there was a lot of humour. Not sure what play she went to but it wasn't this one. Listening to comments from the audience on the way out our feelings were shared. Lessons could be learned from the Segal Center. Vibrant, exciting and entertaining - none of which we experienced at Centaur.  As an aside but certainly not the fault of Centaur, parking rates have skyrocketed. $30.00 flat rate  for an evening is ridiculous. It's laughable though that Centaur recommends using public transit. Just what seniors want to do on a Saturday night!Unless there is a significant turnaround for the rest of the season it is hard to justify renewing a season's subscription. I say this reluctantly because we want the Centaur and English theater in Montreal to flourish. Hopefully it's not too late.Read moreWritten September 23, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The latest, "Little Dickens" was amazing.  Ronnie Berkett's Christmas marionette theater piece was creative and very, very funny.  It must have been physically exhausting for Berkett, who handled and all the marionettes and voiced their characters.  Much was improvised, especially the parts where audience members were brought up to take on various roles.  It was obvious that the audience loved it.  I certainly appreciate the opportunity to attend excellent English-language theater in Montreal.Read moreWritten December 23, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Though the seating is not the most comfortable,  and the parking is always a struggle,  the Centaur puts on very good productions.  The new artistic director Eda Holmes has com into the Montreal scene just fine. I appreciate the playbill booklets for each play.Read moreWritten April 13, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Their last plays are in May and they begin again in the Fall.  But we do have the world's greatest festivals in Montreal during the Summer.  The Montreal Jazz Festival has its own site and you must book early once the lineup is announced; the best shows go very fast.  Come on up!
