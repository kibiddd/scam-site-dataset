Live reviews
Collide The Specials with singing of Paul Weller and you get a beautiful mixture of punk and scar to create The Planet Smashers. And they look to be smashing up this planet on tour.
Taking on Canada very soon, The Planet Smashers exceed everything you desire from a modern day scar act. There live shows echo what The Specials and The Madness use to create. Everyones arms are pumping, milking the cow as it were, feet moving to the beat and this is best exampled in 'Fabricated.' Watch on youtube their Super orgy porno party where members of the crowd join the band on stage performing and everyone is loving it to the max!
It would be absolutely brilliant if the band can breakthrough and smash One Directions planet up, throw Miley Cyrus to the side and put scar music back where it belongs- number one in our hearts and charts. They are touring so hopefully this spirals into a larger tour and the comeback of scar music.
