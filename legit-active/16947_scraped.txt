List of Pok√©mon characters
Caitlin
Caitlin or Caitl√≠n is an Irish female given name. Along with the many other variants of Katherine, it is generally believed to mean "pure" because of its long association with the Greek adjective Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅœåœÇ katharos (pure), though the name did not evolve from this word. The name originated in Ireland as Caitl√≠n [Ààkat ≤l ≤iÀên ≤] and is the Irish variation of the Old French name Cateline [katlin], which was derived from Catherine, which was derived from the Ancient Greek Œë·º∞Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÅŒØŒΩŒ∑ (Aikaterine). Catherine is attributed to St. Catherine of Alexandria.
Variations
Historically, only the spellings Caitl√≠n, Caitlin, Caitlyn and the (anglicised) form Kathleen were used. In the 1970s, however, people began pronouncing the name as KAYT-lin, which led to numerous variations in spelling., including Kaitlin, Katelyn, Catelyn, Catelin, Caitlyn, Kaitlyn etc.

List of Pok√©mon characters
This is a list of Pok√©mon characters in the games, anime series, and manga series. A single character may appear in multiple continuities, sometimes in the same basic role (e.g. Giovanni) and sometimes in very different roles (e.g. Brock).
All references to the "video games" collectively refer to Pok√©mon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, LeafGreen, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black, White, Black 2, White 2, X, Y, OmegaRuby, and AlphaSapphire only, unless noted otherwise. Likewise, references to the Pok√©mon anime also include, in addition to the eponymous anime itself, the related sidestory Pok√©mon Chronicles anime, the game Pok√©mon Channel, and Ash & Pikachu manga unless otherwise noted.
Names in bold are the names from the English-language versions of the video games or anime. Names within parentheses in plain text are the anglicized form of the characters' original Japanese language name if different from the English-language version. Italicized names are the romanized version of the Japanese language name if different from the anglicized version.

Caitlin
Caitlin or Caitl√≠n is an Irish female given name. Along with the many other variants of Katherine, it is generally believed to mean "pure" because of its long association with the Greek adjective Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅœåœÇ katharos (pure), though the name did not evolve from this word. The name originated in Ireland as Caitl√≠n [Ààkat ≤l ≤iÀên ≤] and is the Irish variation of the Old French name Cateline [katlin], which was derived from Catherine, which was derived from the Ancient Greek Œë·º∞Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÅŒØŒΩŒ∑ (Aikaterine). Catherine is attributed to St. Catherine of Alexandria.
Variations
Historically, only the spellings Caitl√≠n, Caitlin, Caitlyn and the (anglicised) form Kathleen were used. In the 1970s, however, people began pronouncing the name as KAYT-lin, which led to numerous variations in spelling., including Kaitlin, Katelyn, Catelyn, Catelin, Caitlyn, Kaitlyn etc.

Literature
Caitlin Brennan, pseudonym of Judith Tarr, American fantasy writer
