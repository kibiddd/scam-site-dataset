About Missouri
Missouri is the 24th state of the United States, which was admitted to the Union on August 10, 1821. Jefferson City is Missouri’s capital city. While Kansas City is the largest city in Missouri, Greater St. Louis is the largest metro and urban area.
English and Spanish are the major spoken languages. In the US, Missouri is the 19th most populous state. Mother of the West, Show Me State, and Cave State are some of its nicknames. “Salus Populi suprema lex esto (Latin)” is the State Motto. It means “Let the good of the people be the supreme law.” Learn more about this US state from Facts of Missouri.
Missouri Flag
Missouri’s state flag has three equal horizontal stripes of color:
Red Stripe (at the top): It represents courage.
White stripe (at the middle): It represents purity.
Blue stripe (at the bottom): It represents justice, vigilance, and permanency.
This flag has a 7:12 proportion. The arms of Missouri are placed at the center of the flag, which overlaps all the three horizontal stripes. On March 22, 1913, the state flag of Missouri was established. It was officially adopted when the State flag act was signed by the then-governor Elliot Woolfolk Major.
A blue band of 24 five-pointed stars of white color encircles the seal of Missouri at the center of the flag. These stars symbolize the admission of Missouri to the Union as the 24th state. “Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto” (which means Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law) is written on a scroll below the image.
Missouri State Symbols
The design of the state seal of Missouri consists of:
Coat of arms including:
Great Seal of the United States (on the right-hand side of the image)
Virgin Mary symbol, a crescent moon (at the top left)
A bear (at the bottom left) at the center circle symbolizes bravery and strength
Twenty-three five-pointed stars are there on the crest. A larger five-pointed star rises to join the other stars. This indicates that Missouri is the 24th state that joined the Union.
To represent the sovereignty of Missouri, a helmet has been placed above the shield.
“United we stand, divided we fall” is written on a gold-colored belt buckle surrounding the coat of arms. This symbolizes that the state of Missouri can unbuckle and secede from the Union if needed.
The center shield is supported by two native bears, who are the supporters.
“Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto” (which means Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law) is written on a scroll below the image.
The words “The Great Seal of the State of Missouri” are written on the circle’s outer ring.
Jefferson City’s Robert Wells designed the Great Seal of Missouri. It was adopted on January 22, 1822.
Missouri History
A wide array of indigenous people used to live in Missouri from around 9000 BCE till the European people arrived. The Mississippian culture was the most prominent one. The ancient Clovis and Folsom culture complexes and the Cahokia burial mounds are some of the ancient sites.
Around 1735, the first Europeans (mainly French) settled on the Mississippi River’s western bank, especially at Sainte Genevieve. These early settlers were mostly hunters and lead miners. St. Louis was founded by a French fur trader named Pierre Laclède Liguest in 1765. To avoid conflict with the Europeans, small Southeast Indian communities started pouring into eastern Missouri.
Missouri attained statehood in 1821. The government forced the entire native population to relocate to the west, especially to Oklahoma, through the torturous Trail of Tears. In the early 20th century, Missouri was predominantly rural, and agriculture was the primary economic resource. However, the 1930’s Great Depression, followed by World War 2, brought a paradigm shift. The manufacturing sector started to replace the dominance of agriculture and mining.
Some of the major wars and battles that took place in Missouri are
St. Louis battle of 1780
Mormon War 1838
Blue Mills Landing (1861)
Kirksville battle, the first battle of independence, Lone Jack battle, 1st Newtonia battle (1862)
2nd Springfield, Cape Girardeau (1863)
Fort Davidson, Glasgow, Westport, 2nd Newtonia (1864), and many more.
