1996 Green Bay Packers season
The 1996 Green Bay Packers season was the team's 77th in the National Football League, which culminated with the franchise winning its third Super Bowl and league-record 12th NFL World Championship .  The Packers posted a league-best 13–3 regular season won-loss record, going 8–0 at home and 5–3 on the road. It was the first time since 1962 that the club went undefeated at home. Additionally, the Packers had the NFL's highest-scoring offense (456) and allowed the fewest points on defense (210). Green Bay was the first team to accomplish both feats in the same season since the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins.  They finished the season with the number one ranked offense, defense, and special teams. They also set a then NFL record for the least amount of touchdowns allowed in a 16-game season, with 19. The Packers also allowed the fewest yards in the NFL and set a record for punt return yardage. Brett Favre won his second straight MVP award while also throwing for a career high and league leading 39 touchdown passes.
