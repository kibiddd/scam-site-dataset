Our tour guide also was so polite and so professional and peppered his stories with humorous anecdotes and cool facts about Montréal. I enjoy travelling solo and exploring but the great benefit to joining group events like this is that you'll be shown things you wouldn't have known to visit on your own. I really enjoyed my winter experience and recommend it!Read moreReview of: Montreal City Sightseeing Tour with Live CommentaryWritten January 19, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Francois was so very knowable and enthusiastic about his work and explaining about each part of Montreal, from the old to the new - so much detail, told with a smile and a sense of humour.  We had a tour on 24 December 9am'ish and Grayling picked us up from our hotel St Sulpice.   Our driver was fantastic as well!  Do not know how our driver managed to drive in all that snow and manoeuvred  the coach so brilliantly - he was marvellous and extremely experienced.  Both Francois and our driver are a credit to the company.  Would highly recommend this tour as it is a brilliant start to your stay in Montreal.

Are there any plans to have qualified drivers and tour guides on the bus so that I receive a TOUR of Montreal?
Is the construction still a problem on the route or have you made
adjustments in the route?Read moreWritten September 24, 2016Dream Travel GuruMontgomery, New York252 contributions0I took the hop on hop off for 2 days, first day I was disappointed due to bilingual guide, having to repeat in French and english, second day, we had an all English tour.  We enjoyed the low price and convenience to get around the city.  It stops at many of the great places.   if you are looking for an in depth tour of the city, search for Andre Saint-Amant as a private tours on trip advisor.Read moreWritten September 13, 2017AnswerRead all 5 responsesDebbie MMichiganWhere is best place to park auto when taking bus tour in Montreal?Read moreWritten September 14, 2016sage97Laurel, Maryland527 contributions0We parked at the AVIS parking lot right across the street.
