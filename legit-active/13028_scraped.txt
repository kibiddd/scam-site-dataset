Gossip - Love Long Distance Lyrics
Artist: Gossip
Album: Music For Men (Alben für die Ewigkeit)
Heyo! SONGLYRICS just got interactive. Highlight. Review: RIFF-it.  RIFF-it good.
Call yourself a romantic
Let me explain
Been Across the whole Atlantic
And back again
I had it with your antics
Your childish games
Baby
I call your number twice
But it rang and rang
Against my best friends advice
I should be ashamed
(You) Did it to me once
You'll do it again
So she says
Love long distance
Is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance
Is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Heard it through the bass line
Not much longer would you be my baby
Work yourself into a panic
Bent outta shape
And then take me for granted
Like nothings changed
All my friends are asking
Why you're that way
But I can't explain
Why I call your number twice
And / but it rang and rang
Against my best friends advice
I should be ashamed
You did it to me once
You'll do it again
She promises
Love long distance
Is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
You're making me crazy
The way that you've been acting lately
I need more of your assistance now
Breaking Up or Breaking Down
When I need you, you can't be found
I want someone who's around for me
Does it have to be so complicated?
Either way I'm devastated
I could use a little comforting
Love long distance
Is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance
Is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love, love, love, love
I need some assistance now
Love
(And) I will Thank you for your cooperation
(And) I will Thank you for your cooperation
Stop playing with me
