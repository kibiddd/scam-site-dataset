About Mansfield
At the heart of our picturesque campus in Northcentral Pennsylvania is the iconic North Hall, which features a six-story atrium, houses our library and the cutting-edge Virtual Reality Lab where you can immerse yourself in a new way of visual learning. South Hall Mall is the center of campus, a popular spot for impromptu student activities anchored by — you guessed it — South Hall and Manser Dining Hall. Pass through here on your way to class, hang out with friends, or grab lunch to go. Feeling adventurous? Lambs Creek Bike and Hike Trail is just a jog or bike ride from campus. Or hop in the car for a quick ride to the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon for some Insta-worthy photos, especially in the fall.

Living in Mansfield
Ranked among the Top 10 Best College Dorms in America by Niche, residential life doesn’t get much better than here. And boy do we have options! We’re talking four residence halls, each with accommodations in a variety of configurations between two-person and four-person set ups — all within steps of our dining options, student activities and recreation, as well as picturesque views of the Tioga River valley.  An added perk, especially from higher points of campus, are those Insta-worthy seasonal sunsets. A perfect way to end a productive and fulfilling day.
The Mountie Life
Campus Housing
Campus Dining
As an active Mountie, we know you'll be hungry! It all starts with our flagship all-you-care-to-eat dining facility, Manser Hall. Here it begins with a full breakfast buffet. Brunch is offered on the weekends, and of course, dinner is set throughout the week with specialty days — ahem, burrito Mondays — along with full menus to serve dietary preferences. No time to sit and chat? Then it's steps down to Lower Manser where your attention is split between the MU 1857 Grill, The Mansfield Deli, and A Slice of MU. On the go? No worries. We got the Mountie Market — a 24/7 location for snacks anytime of the day — and Mountie Coffee, your spot for all the Starbucks favs.

Student Life
There’s a lot of forever moments at Mansfield. That’s what college promises to offer, but it’s different here … it just is. Generations of Mounties relive and celebrate them all the time … at weddings, on vacations, crossing paths in the career field, and especially each fall “back home” during Homecoming. It’s evident. It’s undeniable. It’s the Mountie Life. These moments resonate from all walks of the Mountie experience — from residence halls to apartments, from classes to study lounges, from clubs to organizations, from first year to the graduation stage.
Activities and Organizations
Mountie Pride
You’ll find ample opportunities of fitness and athletics at Mansfield, including playing on or cheering for one of 23 intercollegiate athletics programs. Stay active at the Kelchner Fitness Center — which we affectionally call KFC — where you’ll find an impressive array of strength and cardio equipment, fitness classes like yoga and Zumba, rock-climbing walls, an indoor track, and even bike rentals that are fully equipped to take on the five neighboring biking trails. Get in the game by testing your mettle during intramural competition or step up and square off against our rivals as a member of a club team, including bass fishing.
