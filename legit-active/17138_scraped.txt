SPECIAL COLLECTION: BRITISH AND CANADIAN ARMIES IN CANADA, 1758-1891
For a century after the American Revolution and the peace of 1783, the military in Canada
concerned itself almost exclusively with defence against the United States. During the War of 1812
successful defence against the United States was mostly attributable to the British regular
regiments and the Royal Navy. In 1838 the regular garrison of British North America numbered
over 13,000 men, but fell off to only about 3,000 in 1855 because of the high cost of maintaining
such a force. The Militia Act of 1855 set up a new force of volunteers, not more than 5000 strong,
which would be uniformed and armed and would undergo a short period of annual training. This
volunteer force is the origin of the modern Canadian Army (Militia). The first Militia Act of the
Dominion of Canada, passed in 1868, set up a Department of Militia and Defence and divided the
country into military districts.

This collection of miscellaneous military documents can be broken down into three series: military
administration and records; finances and supplies; and staff. Military records include reports of
losses in the War of 1812 and in the Rebellion in Upper Canada, a copy of a report to the Duke of
Wellington on the military administration of North America, 1825, and a document on the
reconstruction of a monument to Sir Isaac Brock, 1840. Two volumes of army orders for Québec
cover the period 1786-1796, while one for the Montréal Garrison Artillery spans 12-22 April,
1870. Finances, supplies, provisions and wages are the subject of a group of warrants, orders,
receipts and documents, 1759-1858, while correspondence between the Canadian Army, the
Department of the Interior, and David Ross McCord discusses compensation to members of the
Red River Expeditionary Force, 1891. Staffing is documented by a census of the Montréal militia
and of the Light Infantry and Grenadier Companies of the 1st Battalion, 1812, as well as by
appointment letters, 1841.
SPECIAL COLLECTION: MILITARY PAPERS, 1710-1918
For most of its history, Canada has been defended by either French or English regular troops
working in conjunction with local militia units. It was only in 1871 that the last British regulars left
central Canada and the first Canadian regular army units were formed. Canadian forces were
involved in the supression of the Northwest Rebellion of 1885, the Boer War of 1899-1902 and
the First World War, 1914-1918. Although during the First World War the Canadian Corps was
technically part of the British army it was commanded by a Canadian, Sir Arthur Currie and
enjoyed some measure of autonomy. Until 1917, when conscription was instituted by the Borden
government, the Canadian forces were made up entirely of volunteers.

SPECIAL COLLECTION: NAPLES, UPRISING OF 1647
After 1503, Naples was ruled by Spain through a Viceroy. The seggi or municipal administration
was dominated by the aristocracy, but there was a small popular representation. While the uprising
of July 1647 was provoked by the high cost of living and by taxes, and ostensibly lead by a
fisherman named Masaniello, it was in fact organized by Giulio Genoino, a lawyer who wanted
the people's voice on the seggi to be equal to the patricians. The rebels attacked prisons and
armouries, looted the houses of the nobility, and lynched unpopular persons. After a few days, a
settlement was negotiated by the Cardinal Archbishop.

embarked upon the decisive campaign of the war, the seizure of Québec City. The commander of
the French defenders of the city was the Governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, although the key
military commander was the Marquis de Montcalm. The British forces under James Wolfe
captured the city after a battle on the Plains of Abraham where both Montcalm and Wolfe received
mortal wounds. In 1763 the loss of the French empire in North America to the British was
officially recognized by the Treaty of Paris.

In 1812, the United States of America declared war on Great Britain, claiming that the latter had
violated her neutrality.  Most of the battles between the two countries took place in Canada and the
northern United States. Canadian militia units participated in the war, along side the British
regulars. Sir George Prevost, 1767-1816, was the governor-in-chief of the Canadas and the
military commander in chief during the war. Sir Issac Brock, 1769-1812 was the military
commander of Upper Canada and the provisional Lieutenant-Governor until his death at Queenston

(1811). In 1815 he was created K.C.B. Following Napoleon's return from Elba, Wellington
appointed Hardinge as British military commissioner to Prussian headquarters. During the final
confrontation with Napoleon, Hardinge commanded a Prussian division, and lost his left hand in
the battle of Quatre Bras.
Hardinge was elected Tory M.P. for Durham in 1820. He continued his association with
Wellington as clerk of ordnance, and when Wellington became Prime Minister in 1828, Hardinge
was appointed Secretary of War. He served as Irish Secretary for a short period in 1830, and
again in 1834-1835 under Sir Robert Peel. In 1841 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and
resumed the duties of Secretary of War until 1844, when he was named Governor-General of
India. His victory in the First Sikh War (1845) won him his peerage, but his real achievements in
India lay in the areas of economic development, particularly the introduction of railways and tea
cultivation, of public education, and of enlightened cultural policy, especially towards the
preservation of artistic monuments. Hardinge retired from India in 1848. On the death of
Wellington in 1854, Hardinge succeeded his old friend as commander in chief of the forces. He
was named field marshal the following year.
RARE BOOK DEPARTMENT
Originals and Copies, 1803-1856, 6 m and microfilm (Large MSS)
Hardinge's papers are divided into two series: manuscripts and correspondence. The manuscripts
comprise about 550 documents, reports, memoranda, etc. relating to Hardinge's work as a career
soldier and administrator. The Indian phase of his career is the least well covered. Many of these
documents were written by others, such as the Duke of Wellington or Lord John Russell, though
they contain Hardinge's marginal notes. Papers on the British Army cover such topics as religious
services for soldiers, 1823-1844; the organization and reform of military supply departments,
1822-1830; an inquiry into British military education, 1822-1829; and the organization of the
Medical Department, 1812-1828. Material on the Home Army covers the period 1814-1850 while
material on Ireland, 1816-1843, concern not only the militia, but also more wide ranging
economic, social and political issues, such as the commutation of tithes. Papers on British North
America, 1815-1844, concentrate on defence of the St. Lawrence Valley and the Maritimes, with
special emphasis on canals (Rideau, Lachine, Welland). The strength, distribution, health
problems and pay of troops in India, 1846-1847; the fortification of Aden, 1825-1847; and military
matters pertaining to the West Indies, Bermuda, Australasia, South Africa, Mauritius, China, the
Iberian peninsula and the Crimea are also discussed. It should be noted that the Australian papers
also contain a considerable body of civilian population statistics. Hardinge's files also contain
materials on military finance, particularly army estimates, 1826-1844; half-pay and pensions,
1812-1832; pay and allowances, 1827-1841; and the finances of the War Office, 1803-1847.
Finally, a section of miscellaneous papers includes addresses by {Hardinge, memorials of civil
and military officers, cases of military discipline, proposals for new weaponry, and some
documents on the reorganization of the government in 1827. The only items of personal interest
concern the duel between Wellington and Lord Winchelsea, in which Hardinge was Wellington's
second.
The Hardinge correspondence is of much the same character as the manuscripts. It comprises over
2,000 letters, the largest blocks falling in the periods 1828-1831, 1842-1844, and 1852. There is a
particularly substantial body of letters from Wellington and Lord Londonderry.
Supplementing these papers is a microfilm of Hardinge materials in Cambridge University Library.
These place more stress on the Indian period, with a large number of letters from Sir Robert Peel.

MONTECUCCOLI, RAIMONDO, 1608-1681
Raimondo Montecuccoli was one of the outstanding strategists of the 17th century. Born in
Modena, Italy, he began his military career in Germany, in a regiment of Imperial dragoons. His
successes in various engagements in the Thirty Years' War brought his rapid advancement to the
rank of field marshall. In 1657, the Emperor sent him to Poland to help reinstate King John
Casimir, and in the following year he joined the Elector of Brandenburg to help the King of
Denmark. His most famous campaign, however, was waged against the Turks in Transylvania
(1661-1664). From 1672 to 1675 he commanded the Imperial Forces against the French under
Turenne. Turenne's death gave Montecuccoli the ultimate victory, but he retired immediately due to
ill health. He passed the remainder of his life in Vienna, devoting himself to his studies and to
composing his memoirs published in 1708.
