We're coming off of a rough stretch in March that has seen movies misfire left and right, with "Novocaine" and "Black Bag" having recently led the worst weekend of the year so far. All eyes then turned to Disney to hopefully save the day with its live-action remake of "Snow White," which stars Rachel Zegler ("West Side Story") and Gal Gadot ("Wonder Woman"). Sorry to say, this was not like the Disney remakes of the 2010s that did gangbusters business. Rather, it's a full-blown bomb.Director Marc Webb's "Snow White" opened to an estimated $43 million domestically, coming in well below projections that had it debuting in the $50 million range. To be clear, even that wouldn't have been great for a movie with a production budget north of $250 million. Disney needed this to be a smash hit.

The Wicked Witch of the West, one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, has been thoroughly and agreeably overhauled into Elphaba, an intelligent and moral young woman who rebels against a con artist who calls himself the Wizard and demonizes her to his people to ensure that they'll stay true to him.But "Wicked" is far from the only piece of modern pop culture that tries to revisit quintessential baddies.

The movie has been making headlines for years, typically for all the wrong reasons.Whether it's Rachel Zegler's divisive comments about the 1937 classic, Gal Gadot's stance on the Gaza war, or the many changes Disney has made to the story to update it for the present day, there's a lot of negative buzz surrounding this one. Throw in the fact reviews haven't been good and Snow White's opening weekend is off to a sleepy start.According to Variety (via Toonado.com), the movie only drew an estimated $3.5 million from Thursday previews screenings; that's a long way off what Aladdin ($7 million), The Lion King ($23 million), Beauty and the Beast ($16.3 million) made, for example.Snow White is, however, performing better than Maleficent: Mistress of Evil ($2.3 million), Dumbo ($2.6 million), and even Mufasa: The Lion King ($3.3 million...See full article at ComicBookMovie.com3/21/2025ComicBookMovie.comSnow White: The 5 Biggest Changes In Disney's Live-Action RemakeSpoilers for "Snow White" (2025) ahead.By this point, it almost feels as if Disney has already remade every one of its animated classics in live-action. It's a trend that started in the mid-1990s with the Mouse House's live-action redo of "101 Dalmatians," before really ramping up in 2010 with Tim Burton's 3D version of "Alice in Wonderland." Now, at long last, the studio has gone back to the movie that started it all. Both Disney's first feature film and feature-length animated movie, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was released in 1937. Its number is finally up, though, as Disney has gone and refashioned it as a blend of live-action and CGI, this time going under the title "Snow White."

It’s projected to make $45 million to $55 million in its opening weekend, plus another $50 million internationally for a worldwide launch of around $100 million.Based on those projections, “Snow White” will end up below the 2023 “Little Mermaid” remake, which opened with $95 million, and more in line with 2019’s “Dumbo,” which launched with $45 million. “Little Mermaid” had $10.3 million in Thursday previews, while “Dumbo” took flight with $2.6 million. “Snow White” cost more than $250 million, plus marketing costs, so it’ll need to stick around in theaters and play well with families to turn a profit.

Although the press campaign has been muted, Disney hasn’t shied away from a wide roll-out.See full article at ScreenDaily3/21/2025ScreenDailySnow White’s Scary Adventure: Inside the Bumpy Ride to Get Her Remake to the Big ScreenOn Saturday, March 15, on a sunny afternoon, Disney’s “Snow White” finally had its big premiere at the Disney-owned El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood. There was a brightly decorated pre-party with activities for kids. The stars of the movie, Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, who had weathered respective controversies, showed up and even took pictures together, sometimes with director Marc Webb sandwiched in-between them. Instead of actual press, Disney had Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in 1989’s animated classic “The Little Mermaid,” asking questions on behalf of D23, the company’s in-house fan club. A chubby bunny hopped down the red carpet.The premiere felt like a joyful release, or maybe a guttural scream, depending on who you talk to, and served as the culmination of a nearly 10-year journey to get this gauzy remake of Walt Disney’s original animated classic back to the big screen.

Internationally, the Rachel Zegler-led fairy tale is estimating a $50 million take and bring its overall gross to somewhere around $100 million in its first week. Projections are not putting Snow White above previous live-action remakes from the House of Mouse, where 2023’s The Little Mermaid would gross $95 million in its opening weekend.Snow White has an uphill battle to fight as it encountered much controversy, ranging from casting to CGI issues to the stigma of Disney live-action remakes in general. Marc Webb directs this new interpretation. Webb is previously known for also taking up the task of battling the uphill fight of a divisive franchise with The Amazing Spider-Man reboot at Sony.See full article at JoBlo.com3/21/2025by EJ TangonanJoBlo.comMovie Review: Disney’s Snow WhiteThe latest “live-action” re-imagining of an animated Disney classic, Snow White, proves to be less of the triumphant success that 2017’s Beauty and the Beast was and more of a competent and entertaining, yet flawed, adaptation along the lines of Cinderella (2015) or The Jungle Book (2015). Although it has a dynamic tandem of leads in Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, it is Zegler who proves the more intrinsic piece to the film’s overall success than her counterpart.Snow White plays out as a faithful adaptation of the well-known story of an orphaned princess who, with the help of seven dwarves she befriends after escaping the clutches of her evil stepmother, attempts to bring peace and prosperity back to a kingdom that hasn’t enjoyed such since her father and mother ruled over the land side by side.In this version, Snow White is played by Rachel Zegler and her stepmother – aka,...See full article at CinemaNerdz3/21/2025by Mike TyrkusCinemaNerdzDisney’s Snow White | Can we have live-action back in live-action films, please?Snow White is Disney’s latest live-action remake, but why isn’t there that much live-action in it? Some thoughts on that below…Hollywood and audiences have a love-hate relationship with remakes. There’s always the argument that a remake can’t be better than the original, but there are exceptions to that – John Carpenter’s The Thing being one of the finest examples.When we talk about live-action Disney remakes, we tend to think of the newer ones, such as Cinderella, The Lion King and Aladdin. It’s not exactly a new trend for the studio though; its first live-action remake was 1994’s The Jungle Book, followed by 101 Dalmatians, which gave us Glenn Close’s deliciously wicked Cruella DeVil.After 1992’s 102 Dalmatians was largely a disappointment – even that many cute dogs can’t save a film that dull – Disney steered away from remaking its own films.

I’m speaking of the “brain trust” at the “Mouse House” who are diving into the Disney Classics vault once more to remake another one of their animated features. And this is their “deepest dive” yet in this “sub-genre” of “re-imagining” those “2-D”, hand-drawn animated masterpieces into “live-action” films that will hopefully attract a new audience (and enhance the ole’ “I.P.”). It perhaps started nearly thirty years ago with 101 Dalmatians, and had its biggest success with 2019’s The Lion King, with spin-offs like the “backstories” of villains Maleficent and Cruella and the recent prequel/sequel Mufasa: The Lion King. Now it’s “back to the beginning” with a live “re-do” of what was then jeeringly referred to (by the “Tinseltown” gossips) as “Walt’s Folly” in 1937, as animation formally (there had been a few silent-era experiments) burst out of the six or seven-minute...See full article at WeAreMovieGeeks.com3/21/2025by Jim BattsWeAreMovieGeeks.comFilm Review: Wishing Away Disney Live-Action ‘Snow White’Chicago – The latest Disney Studio live action reboot of an animated classic is the worst thing to happen to “Snow White” since the poisoned apple. This woebegone misfire in re-imagining the 1937 film hit a new low with this incompetent, incoherent, and incomprehensible miscalculation of epic proportions.Rachel Zegler is Snow White, a princess daughter of a benevolent king and queen … but her mother the queen later dies. Enter the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), who disappears the king and makes Snow White a scullery maid. When the mirror routine happens … who’s the fairest of them all? … and determines Snow White instead of the Evil One, the Queen banishes her to the forest. There she meets seven dwarves and a Robin Hood type named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) – essentially the prince in this story – who leads a gang who are loyal to Snow’s father.

The remake charmed audiences and many critics, becoming the 12th top-grossing film of the year. Since its success, Disney has remade more of its animated films as live-action, including Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.In 2025, Disney dares to make a live-action remake of the animated classic that started it all, the 1937 film Snow White. Rachel Zegler from West Side Story portrays the fair princess, while Gal Gadot from Wonder Woman slides into the role of her evil stepmother.The movie begins with two little animals opening the fairy tale book Snow White, and a voiceover recites the classic opening line, “Once upon a time.” The narrator then reveals that Snow White was born during a significant snowstorm, leading her parents, the King and Queen, to name her Snow White.See full article at Showbiz Junkies3/20/2025by Kevin FinnertyShowbiz JunkiesSnow White Review: A Dull Disney RemakePlot: An enchanted kingdom is ruined by its evil Queen (Gal Gadot).

It’s become something of a political hot potato, with its detractors claiming it would be overly “woke” based on some clumsy quotes attributed to the movie’s star. Whatever those quotes might have promised, there’s nothing particularly incendiary about this retelling of the Disney classic, and there’s certainly nothing particularly woke about it, with it hitting most of the same beats as the original. However, that doesn’t mean it’s good either.Truth be told, none of Disney’s live-action adaptations of their animated classics have been winners, outside of maybe The Jungle Book, with them typically...See full article at JoBlo.com3/20/2025by Chris BumbrayJoBlo.comSnow White Rotten Tomatoes Score Is Here; Rachel Zegler’s Live-Action Remake Achieves Less Than Half Of Walt Disney’s 1937 OriginalRachel Zegler Snow White Review (Photo Credit – Instagram)Disney’s hotly anticipated Snow White is finally here, but did critics love it? To divert attention from the many controversies incited by lead actress Rachel Zegler’s outspoken stance, the House of Mouse desperately seeks favorable reviews to woo audiences.Unfortunately for Disney, when it confidently lifted the review embargo on Wednesday, expecting a positive critical reception, the results were quite the contrary. Snow White has manifested a milquetoast response, with even its positive reviews ceasing well short of calling it a masterpiece.Snow White holds a 48% “rotten” score on the namesake site after 83 critics weighed in, its aggregated score stranded at 5.5/10. While not abysmal, this number falls below Disney’s recent middling releases, including Moana 2 (61%) and Mufasa: The Lion King (57%).

With stunning visuals, highly memorable musical numbers, and iconic character designs, the legacy of the original movie was always going to be difficult to surpass. Nevertheless, Disney and director Marc Webb sought to reimagine the 88-year-old movie for a new generation.Starring Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, Snow White is far more than a live-action update on the animated classic. Similar to Disney's Cinderella remake from 2015, Snow White further fleshes out the titular heroine's backstory, both with the Evil Queen and her birth parents, which calls back to the original Grimm fairy tale, Schneewittchen. Though the movie aims to honor the legacy of the original movie while updating the story's more problematic elements, it does fall short on executing its...See full article at Comic Book Resources3/20/2025by Diane DarcyComic Book Resources'It Was a Delicious Role': Gal Gadot Talks Playing the Evil Queen in Snow White RemakeGal Gadot switches from a beloved DC hero to a reviled Disney villain thanks to her antagonist role in the anticipated Snow White remake. Though being a baddie is new territory for the acclaimed actor, she insists she had the appetite for the "delicious" role of the Evil Queen in the live-action adaptation from the beginning.Speaking with Variety before her induction into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Gadot shared her thoughts on playing Evil Queen, the tyrannical and envious stepmother of Rachel Zegler's Snow White. The reinterpration of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs not only sees Gadot portray a villain, but sing on-screen for the first time while doing so, challenges she embraced during production. “It was different than anything that I’ve ever done because I was playing the villain,” she said. “She’s so theatrical and so grand and bigger than life … it was a delicious role to play.See full article at Comic Book Resources3/19/2025by Jodee BrownComic Book ResourcesSnow White's Rotten Tomatoes Score Revealed As Critics Praise Rachel Zegler's "Pitch-Perfect" PerformanceSnow White arrives in theaters tomorrow and, despite what's felt like an endless series of controversies and online backlash, it's currently eyeing an opening somewhere between $45 million - $55 million in North America. Overseas, a $50 million debut looks likely for a $100 million global bow.While social media reactions were positive, it's the reviews that count. After all, they - along with that all-important Rotten Tomatoes score - will decide whether Snow White opens closer to $45 million or $55 million.So, what are critics saying about Snow White? As we mentioned on Toonado.com, it's always hard to say this soon into the embargo lifting but they do appear largely mixed/negative.

The star also drew heat for her hostile reaction to Donald Trump’s re-election (she later apologized) and her pro-Palestine stance. People on social media have also attempted to paint a feuding narrative between Zegler and Gadot, the latter of which has spoken out against antisemitism and advocated for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.See full article at The Hollywood Reporter - Movie News3/19/2025by Carly ThomasThe Hollywood Reporter - Movie NewsRachel Zegler's Snow White Remake Continues to Be Polarizing With Debut Rotten Tomatoes ScoreThe debut score has been revealed for the new Snow White remake. Even ahead of its release, the film was rather polarizing, and that trend will continue with the divisive Rotten Tomatoes score.Heading into its opening weekend, Snow White has garnered a debut score on Rotten Tomatoes of 48%. Initially, the early reactions from critics on social media were very promising, though with many other critics having more harsh opinions, the Rotten Tomatoes score is almost firmly right in the middle of the road. The number may continue to fluctuate as added reviews come in, but this is a clear indicator that the critics can't agree on how they feel about Snow White."Snow White offers a fresh spin on the classic tale that is elevated to the realm of a new original musical thanks to tracks by Pasek and Paul," reads one glowing review by Kristen Maldonado of Pop Culture Planet.See full article at Comic Book Resources3/19/2025by Jeremy DickComic Book Resources50 moreIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.
