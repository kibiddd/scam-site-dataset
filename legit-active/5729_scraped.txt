American character actor Denis O'Hare found lasting fame from his roles in supernatural thrillers, especially his partnership with famed producer Ryan Murphy. He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but spent the majority of his youth in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. After college at Chicago's Northwestern University, he moved to New York to work in theater. He appeared in Off-Broadway productions before making his Broadway debut in 1995's "Racing Demon." On screen, he began securing small roles in television shows like "New York Undercover" (Fox, 1994-99). In film, Woody Allen cast the actor in a small role in "Sweet and Lowdown" (1999), starring Sean Penn. O'Hare would appear again with Penn in the political drama "Milk" (2008), playing anti-gay California politician John Briggs. Like numerous theater actors, he made numerous appearances on Dick Wolf's "Law & Order" (NBC, 1990-2010). He also had a recurring role on the family drama "Brothers & Sisters" (ABC, 2006-11). After roles in films such as "Charlie Wilson's War" (2007), with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, and "Baby Mama" (2008), with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, he began gaining traction as a film actor. His appearance as an immigration agent investigating the relationship between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in "The Proposal" (2009) provided additional audience recognition. He stepped squarely into the limelight, however, when he was cast as Russell Edgington in HBO's "True Blood" (HBO, 2008-14). Playing the ambitious vampire king, he became one of television's most unique villains. He continued his supernatural run with help from Murphy. The producer cast the actor in the first season of "American Horror Story" (Fox, 2011- ) as the "Burned Man." He would return to the series in the third season "American Horror Story: Coven," playing the butler to a coven of witches, in the fourth, "American Horror Story: Freak Show," as the con artist partner of Emma Roberts, and would have roles in the fifth and six seasons as well. The actor had a recurring role as Judge Charles Abernathy in "The Good Wife" (CBS, 2009-16) and its spinoff "The Good Fight" (CBS All Access, 2017- ). Similarly, he lent his talents to the series "The Comedians", "This Is Us" (NBC), and "Big Little Lies" (HBO), in recurring parts. He never stopped working in film, with prominent roles in "J. Edgar" (2011), "Dallas Buyer's Club" (2013), "Late Night" (2019), and "The Goldfinch" (2019). On television, he joined the cast of Joss Whedon's Victorian-themed thriller "The Nevers" (HBO, 2020- ) playing a ruthless surgeon.
