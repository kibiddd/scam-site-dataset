Kate Campbell – Galaxie 500                                lyrics
We got her white
From the factory
But daddy had her
Painted baby blue
She had
A red vinyl interior
That burned my legs
On summer afternoons
She took us
Down to Panama City
And we got sand
All in the seats
And the year
We went out west
She made it up
Pike's Peak
I could go anywhere
In that automobile
My dreams came true
Behind the wheel
No road was too long
No mountain too steep
For me
And my Galaxie 500
Mama said kids
I'll be right back
And left us
In the K-Mart parking lot
On the radio
We heard the news
In Memphis Dr. King
Had just been shot
So late that night
I sat alone
Feet propped up
On the big dashboard
And I cried myself
To sleep again
Like every time before
When I came home
From school one day
In the driveway
Sat a Datsun
With two doors
And I never told
A single soul
How much
I missed that Ford
No road was too long
No valley too deep
For me
And my Galaxie 500
