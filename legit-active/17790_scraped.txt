By: Brett MacKnight
June 27, 2008 - PRLog -- A new reality series featuring Amanda Lucas and eleven other female Mixed Martial Artists is being produced by Los Angeles based production company One Giant Leap Media.  Promoter Belinda Dunne brought together two teams (USA vs Australasia) for the continental  'Princesses of Pain' Championship and the cameras were there to capture all of the drama, including Lucas'mixed martial arts debut in Auckland on May 31st.These bouts feature female fighters from all walks of life, skilled in jiu-jitsu, boxing, judo, kickboxing, and wrestling. The contests are full-on fights by highly trained athletes drawing crowds from all over the world.The unique aspect and controversial element of the fights  have single-handedly transformed these ladies into America¹s newest sports heroes, and have catapulted these competitions into the limelight as an athletic, social and cultural phenomenon sweeping the nation and world by storm. Led by Team Captain Lana Stefanic, Team USA consists of Amanda Lucas, Tamara Parks, Shawn Tamaribuchi, Van Do, Katie Meehan and Cindy Hales.Team Australasia is led by Captain Tony Green and consisted of Nicole Kavanagh, Margaux La Trobe, Leighann Banham, Mandy Stewart, Michelle Preston and Fiona Muxlow. Executive Producer Andrea Stockert is aware of the controversial nature of the footage and welcomes a discussion. ³My ultimate vision was to explore why these women do this, and why we all have such visceral reactions when we see them put on the gloves and hit each other.  As an outsider, it looks incredibly brutal and uncontrolled- but once you understand the game (and the women) you begin to see it all so differently - it becomes an art form,² comments Stockert. "The footage has already garnered a lot of interest from cable networks and agencies" says Stockert, "and we are now taking the steps to find the right home for the series. We're looking forward to finding the right match."# # #ABOUT BAM MEDIA: The best and boldest new media solution based in Los Angeles, CA, BAM Media is all about MEdiaEnd
