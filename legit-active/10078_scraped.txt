Is this a Giorgio Chinaglia-joint? Isn't he the one behind these Cosmos-esque barnstorming tours?

I believe this one is run by CAA Sports and MLS

What are the chances we could get a block of Orange RailHawks supporters in among the sea of red & white Chivas fans? (I doubt there will be too many Juve fans.)

I had a friend ask about ticket prices. Do we know where they start at yet?

Judging from the other games, I'd say they'll be around $40-150

Will this game, or any of them, be televised or streaming online?  BTW, even if it's blocked locally, it can be found online if on tv at all   It would likely be good to watch, but I don't know that I want to spend that much for the family to see two teams we really are indifferent about.

I'm indifferent to both teams as well, but I'm still going. I'm sure if there was a really good turnout for this match, it would bode well for any future MLS aspirations the RailHawks might have. Plus, I've always wanted to see how they'd do soccer in Carter-Finley. The field dimensions are too narrow for my liking, but there's great atmosphere when the house is near full.
Sadly, I bet they won't allow any food trucks in. That'd be perfect.

With Chivas there, this should be a packed house.  I personally don't want to spend the money for teams I don't care too much about, but I bet the atmosphere from the Chivas fans all across the region will be great.

about $30-45 for endzone
about $60-90 for sideline
$150 for club
not all that bad, considering how pricey these usually are

Oh, I'm so going.
Should I buy the tickets early, or do you think I'll be fine on gameday?

Have you ever been to one of the RailHawks exhibition games when they face a Mexican team? No, you haven't because I'm the only gringo in the stands!
It's amazing how many latinos will show up for one of these matches, even if they're not fans of that particular Mexican team. Entire families will be decked out in their favorite team's colors. It's not just a soccer game, it's more important than that. It's a cultural celebration.
There will be tons of Chivas fans in attendance and there will be just as many Chivas haters too, just to heckle the Goats. Juve? Not so much.

True. Though there are 20,000 seats at Carter-Finley compared to 7,000 at WakeMed. I was just taking that into consideration. I'm most likely buying early, or show up VERY early on matchday if I have to.
And I was at the RailHawks vs Mexico U-23's a couple years back.

No worries. I wasn't sure either until I looked it up.   Besides, I don't believe in "epic fails." It's too much faux drama for me.
