Lyrics to Hamilton Anxiety Scale
Hamilton Anxiety Scale Video:
Can't control my fear, my doubts.I want to change, help me. x 2When rivers flow backwards Our words drown inside us.Speak up, scream out, hear me.
Come out of this shell.
Breathe in slowly--feel your pulse.
Lay down with sound--feel your pulse.
Can't control my fear, my doubts.
I want to change, help me.
