The Liberals are low in Quebec, but the problem for the BQ is that the Bloc is at an all-time low in some of the polls too.  The BQ has lost ground in the polls since the campaign began, and so even if the Liberal vote drops in a riding like this, the BQ vote will drop too so they will not be able to benefit from it.

If Pablo Rodriguez could survive through the sponsorship scandal, I see no reason why he shouldn't hold this one.  It will probably only be a plurality but I expect it to stay Liberal.

Liberals are at all time low in Qu�bec. The Bloc has a well known and appreciated candidate. Also, the libs only won previous elections because of Bloc supporters no show at polls. The Bloc will pick this one up. Pablo is gone

I also just noticed that the former BQ candidate from 2006 & 2008, G�rard Labelle, is now running for the Conservatives.  The fact that the former BQ candidate gave up and joined the Conservatives may show that he didn't think the BQ could win, so that doesn't look good for the BQ.

I'm not sure if Martin Laroche is considered a 'star candidate'.  He is a comedian/actor, but I don't think that's a strong enough profile to win against an incumbent MP in a riding like this.   Rodriguez was able to hold this riding during the Sponsorship Scandal, and won by a large margin in 2008.  The Liberal vote may be down from 2008, but I think if the Bloc wanted to win here they would have run someone with more political experience.  Actors don't usually get elected to Parliament, and Laroche has a thin r�sum� from what I can tell.  The BQ also appears to be down from 2008 in the latest polls, so that may cancel out any decline in the Liberal vote.

Suite � une course serr�e en 2004, le Lib�ral a connu une remont�e artificielle de sa majorit� due seulement aux bloquistes qui sont rest�s chez eux (voir les donn�es) en 2006 et 2008. Avec le vent glacial qui souffle actuellement sur la faveur lib�rale partout au canada mais surtout au Qu�bec, ce n'est pas l'appui de sa petite mafia lib�rale de village qui permettra � Rodriguez d'�tre r��lu. Un candidat vedette comme Martin Laroche il est � peu pr�s temps que ce comt� passe au BQ.

After a close race between the BQ and the Liberals in 2006, this was one of several Liberal ridings in Quebec in 2008 where the Liberal vote went up and the BQ vote went down.  Pablo Rodriguez has also become one of the highest-profile Liberals in Quebec.  Another Liberal riding that looks like it will stay that way.

Circonscription acquise aux Lib�raux. Rodriguez ne craint rien, d'autant plus qu'il avait tr�s bien r�sist� lors du scandale des commandites. Alors maintenant...
