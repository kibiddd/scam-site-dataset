Aimless Love
Great Days: the John Prine Anthology
Aimless
Love
Â©John Prine
He's just a small fry. A bit too gun shy.
To have his heart touched without a glove
He looks at strangers as potential dangers
Trying to Steal his aimless love.
Love has no mind. It can't spell unkind.
It's never seen a heart shaped like a Valentine
For if love knew him. It'd walk up to him
And introduce him to an aimless love
I been out walking. Kinda pillow talking
To anyone that has the time for me
For there are some folks they think that love chokes.
It ties and keeps them from being free
Love has no mind. It can't spell unkind
It's never seen a heart shaped like a Valentine
For if love knew you. It'd walk up to you
And introduce you to an aimless love
Do you look at strangers as potential dangers
Trying to steal your aimless love.
Love has no mind. It can't spell unkind
It's never seen a heart shaped like a Valentine
For if love knew you. It'd walk up to you
And introduce you to an aimless love
And introduce you to an aimless love
