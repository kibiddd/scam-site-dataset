Testimonials
Check out some reviews from our CPR Classes
I just wanted to reiterate our thanks for the onsite training you did at our offices in July/August.  That training came in useful for dealing with shock after the recent accident in our neighborhood: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/vehicle-crashes-into-building-in-pioneer-square/. One of our employees witnessed a pedestrian being hit by the runaway vehicle and went into shock.  Thanks to our training, several of us were able to help them when it happened and get them the care they needed.
So thanks again!  We didn’t expect to use the training so quickly, but we’re very grateful that our staff felt confident enough to respond to someone in need.

Depending on what type of CPR class you need or are interested in, you have come to the right place to receive that certification.
There are classes specific to healthcare, family and recreation safety, instructor training and the general CPR, First Aid & AED. You can sign up to attend one of their classes at their facility on 45th Street or they travel to you.
Signing up is easy, all you need to do is look for the class you want to sign up for. I signed up for Adult/Child/Infant CPR, First Aid & AED class, which was roughly 4.5 hours. My instructor was Jeff, who was friendly and great at explaining the material.
Fun fact: you receive your ecard certification immediately after class and it recommends what year you should renew.
Definitely looking forward to signing up for some of their other classes like Mastering Fundamentals of Skin Laceration Repair, Wilderness First Aid or Pet CPR & First Aid.

I'm a Certified Personal Trainer/Health Coach and just did the Adult First Aid/CPR/AED training with Dan. I've been renewing my certification every two years for the past 10 years and this was by far the best one ever. Why? Because it was based on constant practicing, drills, interactivity and excellent communication. The instructor explained the why of everything rather than just teaching basic facts and how.... I'll be back again in 2 years.... and will do the pet first aid in the meantime. It actually made me consider teaching CPR myself. Bravo!!!!!
