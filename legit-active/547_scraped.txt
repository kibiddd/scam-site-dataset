fresh new copy ASAP!

Reason #1:
Your film is deteriorating while you are reading this
webpage.
Reason #2:
Make it easy and accessible to view your filmed
memories.
Reason #3:
No more burnt out bulbs, screens to set up, film tears to
repair.
Reason #4:
DVDs make everything so easy and inexpensive to view old
images.
Like film, video tape deteriorates with time. And it is a subtle deterioration: first the colors fade and then the rest of
the images. So, we recommend all transfers be made to DVD. Each DVD will have an automatically imbedded chapter stop
every 5
minutes. Additional reasons: better video transfer and better audio on playback.
Once your film memories are archived to DVD, you will be assured that the images will last for years. Remember, all orders
include one DVD copy for the safety deposit box and the other one for general use. All DVDs are only one scratch or
mishandling away from becoming useless.
Note: If you intend to edit your films after the transfer, we recommend a film transfer to mini-DV or DVCAM tape. All Prices
are here. If you decide to transfer to digital tape, please note that we will not transfer titles or music.
We don't want you to forget your valued memories that are now on film so here's our good news:  transfer prices are
reasonable!  Once transferred view your movies on a DVD set top player, a computer or a VCR. Additionally, you can
choose
the transfer to be to: VHS, mini-DV, DVCAM tape or DVD-R (our recommendation). We keep it simple too our prices are the
same for 8mm, super 8mm or 16mm film.
