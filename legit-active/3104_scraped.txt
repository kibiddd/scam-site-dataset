Coach: Gary Pinkel (5th year at Missouri)
Team Name: Tigers
2004 Record: 5-6
2004 Big 12 Conference Record 3-5
2004 ATS Record: 3-7
Returning Starters: 10
The strength of the Tigers 2004 squad was the defense. They
were the 2nd best in the Big 12 and were ranked 14th in the
nation in total defense. This season the Missouri defense must
replace 8 starters, including their top 2 tackles and their
2 best linebackers. A drop-off is anticipated and the offense
will need to pick up the slack.
The Tigers offense is lead by standout quarterback Brad Smith.
Smith and the Missouri offense took a step back in 2004, when
Coach Pinkel decided to concentrate on truing Smith into more
of a pocket passer. After disappointing results, this idea has
been scrapped and the Tigers offense will now revolve around
putting Smith on the run where he flourished the previous 2
years. This gives Smith options to run or pass to his gifted
wide outs. The biggest improvement will have to come from the
offensive line which struggled in the 2004 season.
Besides a meeting with Texas all of the other games on Missouri’s
schedule are winnable, as all lines should be within 1 score
either way. A bowl big is obtainable in this up for grabs North
division.
