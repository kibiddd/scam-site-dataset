Anybody catch the show at Yoshi's last week?? Caught it on Wed nite and i was thoroughly disappointed... He's not doubt a great artist but his live shows are mos def hits or misses.. (mostly misses when i've caught him).. Seemd like he was content having people listen to a jam session and not a focused show....

Mos Def is mos definitely worth avoiding.  No talent and no brain.  The final straw was when he wason the "panel" with Cristopher Hitchens and Salman Rushdie on the "Real Time with Bill Maher" show. Yikes!!! Someone should have given him the hook or at least given him flash cards.  Here we had two brilliant articulate writers trying to have a conversation while the nitwit Mos Def clearly not only couldn't follow the thread of thought but hearrogantly talked nonstop OVER Hitchens and Rushdie, and prevented the conversation from going anywhere.  I suspect it was Mos Def's appearance that has caused Bill Maher to change the format of his show.  Mos Def gave as pitiful an appearance as any "artist" could possibly make, only compounded by his complete cluelessness...............

Carlo:Yes I saw the mos def show in Oakland on Thursday night.  I brought some music heads with me as well.  You should have known by the 'chosen" venue that this was going to be a Jazz trip hop show.  I did not expect to hear "black on both sides."  I was not dissappointed in the least.The band he put together for this show was a group of super talented young black musicians....The drummer was absolutely a stunning player.  So quick and in the pocket.  He was amazing.  Mos Def was cool and performed some cover of Slum Village, Radio Head, Miles Davis, and of course Bel Biv De Voe....It was a great show......It was a Jazz show.

"Mos Def is a great lyricist. I've never seen him live, but he mos def can string some words together well."Oh, Puhleeezze.  Greaty lyricist compared to whom? Bob Dylan, Springsteen, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Marley?  Those are poets.The example of "lyrics" you gave just proved my point about Mos Def being a nitwit.  No depth to the song, the lyrics are  simply a shopping list of "foreground" superficial details with some flirtation and ends with sexist imagery. It's trite and just like every other shallow song of this era and genre.Perhaps you need to educate yourself about what lyricism is all about.........

The postings i have made were about lyrics and lyricism in reference to Mos Def............If any of you wish to put forth the names of Hip Hop albums that can rank with great poetry be my guest. I haven't heard anything that reminds me of Dylan or Dylan Thomas by a nautical mile. What I have heard is lots of trite imagery that was old by the 60's, to say nothing of hatred and objectifying directed toward me as a woman.  I stand by my remarks on Mos Def re: his appearance on Bill Maher as well as the brainlessness and sexism of the lyrics quoted by  May T.

I've seen Mos Def tons of times...he's been worse lately..but I saw him before he was this huge star/actor. Dude always put on a good show back then. Aaron..if you want to see a great hip hop group/rapper..go see The Roots..go see Pharohe Monche...it's just kinda sucks..a lotta great mc's perform mostly in the east coast. There's more of a thriving scene there than out here. The bay sucks for real hip hop now. Gotten more and more jiggified and big willy style in the last several years. but let's not compare black art to white art...the canon of great white art can never be challenged right Viviano? Hilarious.

Whatever Viano.  Again you are not a fan or listener of hip hop and you are slamming a hip hop / jazz artist...nuff said.Here is a piece from the San Jose Mercury Review:  The name the drummer:The set list mixed Eric Dolphy with Slum Village, Radiohead with Common, and - get this - even included some Huey Lewis. About the only thing missing was a little Chuck Berry, the rock legend that the rapper (born Dante Terrell Smith) portrayed in the 2008 movie "Cadillac Records."All of the selections received hip metropolitan makeovers from the 35-year-old New Yorker and his sensational band of players - pianist Robert Glasper, bassist Mark Kelly, drummer Chris "Daddy" Dave, saxophonist Casey Benjamin and trumpeter Keyon Harrold. And, for the most part, the ensemble's formula of experimental jazz + positive-tip hip-hop + loads of charisma equaled a very entertaining evening.

I like Mos a lot, but he is kind of a mush mouth. He can work the mush mouth stylistically on his albums, but when you get him in a talk show setting, he's almost unintelligible. I will say that his more recent appearance on Bill Maher was much better than the first time he was on the show when he really came off like a raving lunatic.

He was an mc before he ever got into acting. Check out UTD in 94.  Jessus..I love the kiddies on here...they hear about people 10yrs after the fact and think they know everything about them ..or just don't even do a simple search to find out about their background.

I was at the Mos Def show on Wednesday last week and he rocked the fuckin mic.  It was what I expected...what I described as a jazz-hop show.  He displayed his diversity, his range, his incredible flow.  His band was also simply amazing...Chris Dave and Robert Glaspar...and the dude with the dreads with the oh-my-god-seriously-low-rise-skin-tight-hipster-jeans playing the keytar.I love love love Mos Def.  If you think that he's not a talented artist and musician...seriously, get your ears and head checked.'nuf said.

JP,I'm ignorant because I don't like Mos Def?? Okay, now you sound ignorant. And furthermore, I don't know where you got your info, but Mos Def was an actor before he became a rapper. And I have friends who work in the music industry who personally know about dude, and they don't think much of him.I've also seen his performances, and he's wack in my opinion. The only album I ever liked of his IS "Black on Both Sides" and some songs he did with Q-Tip. That's it. So, glad you think you know so much shit cuz you Wikipedia his info.

Joe, don't get me wrong...Mos is one of my favorite rappers. I saw him live at a little show in Watts with Talib, J5, Saul Williams and a bunch of other people before he "got big" too. But enunciating isn't his strong suit. :)

He started rapping in 94..shit he was on De La's Stakes is High Album..the Bush Babees albums..way before he started acting. You're wrong. I never wikipedia'd his info. Actually I've been a hip hop fan before it was ever cool or before Tupac and gangsta rap. Please. Again..all you've shown is a lot of ignorance. You really shouldn't be talking about the dude if you really think he was an actor before a rapper. What movie was he in before the early 90's? I'm all ears. (like Will Smith)

I was talking about him doing theatre before actually becoming an MC. Btw, most rappers aren't going to admit to doing something like beforehand because to them it might mess up their street cred.Any rapper, including Tupac himself, and with the antics of Rick Ross can create another identity and story for themselves to feed the public. Regardless, I don't think much of him and that's my right. You're entitled to think he's the shit :)

totally missd out on the discussion the last few daze.. but listen.. Dante, like i said, is talented.. No doubt, no questions asked.. i knew he wouldn't perform a strictly live hip hop show.. i don't really think he incorporated the hip hop or jazz aesthetic very well.. at best, the show was a jam session..  the band was amazing but he missed the opportunity to really shine.. he has the right to be an artist and experiment... but at least make it good .. go have a jam session, tighten up the set, and get back to us.. don't charge us to watch u stumble around and repeat lyrics for 5min and call it a show..(and he claimed that the show was gonna be good.. and he dissappointly pointed out that "he wasn't a jukebox" when fans were playfully calling out songs..)there were spots in the show that had potential.. but he never followd thru.. (totally reminded me of the time he opened up for femi at the hollywood bowl).. if jay-z can rock a set wid the Roots, mos can totally put aside his artistic pride and ego, and tighten up his performances.. or at least be a lot more focused..

JP,At the risk of going off on a few too many tangents and taxing your poor brain, here's wtf I'm talking about my good man:1) As yvonne just confirmed and as I've been saying before, Mos Def was into theatre and acting before becoming a rapper. Your point about how many movies he's been in was irrelevant and misguided in that acting can come in different forms, such as theatre/plays or commercials, etc. I wasn't talking about him being in movies.2) DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. Mos Def, like many rappers, including Tupac and as I mentioned Rick Ross (surprised you haven't heard the true story about him) is a self-created product and image. He's an actor playing a rapper, and he, his publicist, and the media have created their own story about him for the public's consumption that anyone can find out about.Your so-called knowledge about him is probably minimal at best and what's superficially given to most websites and other forms of media.Aside from his background, I see him as being arrogant and full of himself, and I've heard from inside sources some notso complementary things about him. I don't see as him as being sincere in the things in he talks about.3) Your arrogance and supposed "schooling" of us supposed youngins (I'm 30 btw) was cute and most entertaining. Thanks for that bit of a lesson Mr. I Am Hip-Hop.4) The most important point here is: I don't like Mos Def. I don't think he's that great of a rapper or performer, and I'm entitled to my opinion and I'm entitled to not liking him just as you're entitled to thinking he's the greatest thing since sliced bread.

It's funny...you find out Tupac took theater classes in high school and think every rapper is the same. Hilarious...your knowledge of hip hop is consumed by pop shit.

Saying shit like that shows how dumb you are and just plain ignorant. Please...dude saved indie hip hop in the 90's and brought lyricism back to the game for a while. If you haven't heard his first solo album or heard the Blackstar album you're missing out.

um...the entire history of hip hop is filled with rappers whose stage person is drastically different than who they are in "real life." I don't see why Mos is any different from Kool Herc to KRS-ONE, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, P. Diddy/Puff Daddy/Diddy, Eminem, Ice Cube and Flavor Flav.I'd expect Mos Def to be a lot different than Dante Smith...wouldn't you?I can only think of a few rappers that use their real names off the top of my head...Talib, Nas, Kanye, Rakim. Who else is there?

Tuesday night (April 21), New York deejay Funkmaster Flex made a sizable threat on his HOT97 radio show. According to Flex, he plans on banning all Interscope artists from his show.Throughout the broadcast, Flex made several references to an employee at Interscope Records whom he referred to as Nino."Like I told you, Interscope Records is a label," Funkmaster Flex explained on his show. "They have G-Unit-they have 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo. They have Akon's label too...A lot of your favorite artists New York, but let me tell you something. That label is trying to make some decisions. Nino, let me tell you something Nino. New York, I'm talking to a person who makes decisions. Who does things up there moving funny style."Flex then went on to explain that he will no longer play any music from artists on Interscope unless changes are made."Interscope Records, nothing is spinning...I take pride in how I'm gonna do this movement," Flex explained.Flex even urged 50 Cent to leave the label telling the Queens rapper, "From what I understand your deal's up at Interscope. We got you. I'd walk out that building after that. Let's do it, let's do it."If Flex's boycott were to in fact happen, major artists such as Eminem and Dr. Dre will no longer be in Flex's rotation.

With independent distribution through the internet, myspace, etc. the fate of the dj to promote and hype artists is not as relevant as it once was, say 15 yrs ago.  That being said...dudes like Flex have a serious following but with a limited audience.  Some suburban kid in Anywhere, USA will most likely not give a hoot about any Flex's boycott on Interscope.

Mos was a top notch theater actor, but now the only thing really interesting about him is he helped bring back the fedora trend.It just happens that he's a bozo whenever he tries to act socially conscious, and his hip hop credentials went sour the second he ripped off Grandmaster Caz for a tv commercial.
