The Music of
Mary Elizabeth Caldwell
Mary Elizabeth Caldwell (1909 - 2003), distinguished American composer,  was educated at UC Berkeley, with further study at the Munich Conservatory and the Juilliard School. A church organist for over fifty years, many of her hundreds of published works were written for various choirs ranging from youth to adult, with voicings ranging from unison to complex divisi SATB.  She composed numerous cantatas for   young voices  and  was one of the first composers to explore the rich folk carol tradition. Several such arrangements were chosen by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for their earliest recordings in the late fifties and are still favorites today. In the sixties her interests expanded to include opera and liturgical drama. She was commissioned by the Pasadena Junior League to write three operas for children to be presented by the Pasadena Symphony all of which delighted thousands of children. The second of the these, A Gift of Song, the story of Franz Gruber's  composing of Silent Night, has been presented in numerous performances  world wide from Australia to Europe and often regarded the equal of Amahl. In  addition, she has written  collections for solo voice and organ. Her works have been the subject of both a Masters and Doctoral dissertation and she has been listed in Who's Who of American Women since 1967.
