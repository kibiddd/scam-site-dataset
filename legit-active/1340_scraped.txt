Lima (footballer)
Rodrigo José Lima dos Santos (born 11 May 1983), known as Lima, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Emirati club Al-Ahli Dubai F.C. as a striker.
He spent the better part of his professional career in Portugal, amassing Primeira Liga totals of 175 games and 85 goals over the course of six seasons, representing mainly Braga and Benfica and winning six major titles with the latter club, notably the treble in 2014.
Club career
Early years
Born in Monte Alegre, Pará, Lima played for nine different clubs in his country, without settling at any. In the 2008 edition of the Série A he did not manage to score for Santos FC, who ranked in 15th position.
In the 2009 summer, after failing to sign with Ukrainian side FC Metalist Kharkiv, Lima moved to Portugal with C.F. Os Belenenses, scoring regularly for the Lisbon team but also suffering relegation from the Primeira Liga.
Braga
Afterwards, Lima joined another club in the country, S.C. Braga – which was filled with several of his compatriots – signing a three-year contract. On 24 August 2010, after coming on as a substitute, he netted a hat-trick against Sevilla FC in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, in a 4–3 away win (5–3 on aggregate).

Lima (restaurant)
Lima is a restaurant in London, United Kingdom, which serves Peruvian cuisine. The chef patron is Virgilio Martínez Véliz. In 2014, it was awarded a Michelin star, the first time a restaurant serving this cuisine had been awarded a star in Europe.
Description
Lima is owned by Gabriel and Jose Luis Gonzalez, in conjunction with Peruvian chef Virgilio Martínez Véliz. The front of house is run by maître d’ Bunmi Okolosi, formerly of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. In the kitchen, Roberto Ortiz is the head chef of the restaurant as overseen by chef patron Virgilio Martínez Véliz. Martínez Véliz is the chef at Central Restaurante in Lima, Peru, which was named 15th in the 2014 The World's 50 Best Restaurants.
The interior of Lima was designed by Erik Munro, and features a mural whilst the rest of the restaurant is beige. The restaurant is small and narrow, and mirrors are used to give the impression of greater space. A skylight lights the rear of the restaurant, the remainder of which is lit by candles and industrial-style lamps. The kitchen is open to the dining area of the restaurant.

Lima (models)
Lima S.p.A (Lima Models) was a brand of railway models made in Vicenza, Italy, for almost 50 years, from the early 1950s until the company ceased trading in 2004.  Lima was a popular, affordable brand of 00 gauge and N gauge model railway material in the UK, more detailed H0 and N gauge models in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States as well as South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia. Lima also produced a small range of 0 gauge models. Lima partnered with various distributors and manufacturers, selling under brands such as A.H.M., Model Power, and Minitrain. Market pressures from superior Far Eastern produce in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with Rivarossi, Arnold, and Jouef. Ultimately, these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004.
Hornby Railways offered €8 million to acquire Lima's assets (including tooling, inventory, and the various brand names) in March of the same year, the Italian bankruptcy court of Brescia (town near Milan, last headquarters of Lima) approving the offer later that year.  In December 2004, Hornby Railways formally announced the acquisition along with the Rivarossi (H0 North American and Italian prototypes), Arnold (N scale European prototypes), Jouef (H0 scale French prototypes), and Pocher (die-cast metal automobile kits) ranges.   As of mid-2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and sprung buffers and sockets for DCC (Digital Command Control) decoders.

Lima (footballer)
Rodrigo José Lima dos Santos (born 11 May 1983), known as Lima, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Emirati club Al-Ahli Dubai F.C. as a striker.
He spent the better part of his professional career in Portugal, amassing Primeira Liga totals of 175 games and 85 goals over the course of six seasons, representing mainly Braga and Benfica and winning six major titles with the latter club, notably the treble in 2014.
Club career
Early years
Born in Monte Alegre, Pará, Lima played for nine different clubs in his country, without settling at any. In the 2008 edition of the Série A he did not manage to score for Santos FC, who ranked in 15th position.
In the 2009 summer, after failing to sign with Ukrainian side FC Metalist Kharkiv, Lima moved to Portugal with C.F. Os Belenenses, scoring regularly for the Lisbon team but also suffering relegation from the Primeira Liga.
Braga
Afterwards, Lima joined another club in the country, S.C. Braga – which was filled with several of his compatriots – signing a three-year contract. On 24 August 2010, after coming on as a substitute, he netted a hat-trick against Sevilla FC in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, in a 4–3 away win (5–3 on aggregate).
