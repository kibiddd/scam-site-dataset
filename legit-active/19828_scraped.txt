Dear ESPN 860.
your signal during night hours after 7 PM in the area of Sacramento become very weak to the point of we can't listened to any of your programs like balon latinoamericano and others programs please can you guys do something to improve your signal especially during night hours!.
thank You.!! By: manny perez on December 17, 2012
Hola,espero que puedan leer estas lineas,por favor podrian alguien de su empresa aumentar el bataje por la noche de su radio trasmicion,debido a que despues de las 7:30pm su trasmisio se debilita por un 90% a casi un 100%,dejando  asi mas de 25 ciudades sin recibir su trasmicion de los programas balon latinoamericano, y los demas programas que le siguen,
Por favor si alguien hiciera un estudio veria las oprtunidades  ecomonicas y de marketing que 860AM esta perdiendo por las noches!!.
Gracias y siempre seguire fiel a ESPN 860AM deportes radiBy: manny perez on February 16, 2013
I can't believe 860am in San Francisco put a regular SF Giants game in Spanish and not the World Cup. How many Spanish speaking people in the bay area is listening that, not to many. What a mistake, but that is the USA sport radio, they don't have a clue what is important for us.
Are they bigots or just poor business practice.
Please let the soccer funs enjoy our game at list the World Cup.   By: Hugo Franco on June 12, 2014
