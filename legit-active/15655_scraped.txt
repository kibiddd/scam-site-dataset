Bordeaux
Bordeaux (French pronunciation:¬†‚Äã[b…î Ådo]; Gascon: Bord√®u) is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France.
The municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 241,287 (2012). Together with its suburbs and satellite towns Bordeaux is the center of the Bordeaux M√©tropole, which with 737,492 inhabitants (as of 2012) is the 9th largest in France. It is the capital of the Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called "Bordelais" (for men) or "Bordelaises" (women). The term "Bordelais" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.
The city's nicknames are "La perle d'Aquitaine" (The Pearl of Aquitaine), and "La Belle Endormie" (Sleeping Beauty) in reference to the old center which had black walls due to pollution. Nowadays, this is not the case. In fact, a part of the city, Le Port de La Lune, was almost completely renovated. Bourdeaux is the city with has the highest number of preserved historical buildings in France, except for Paris.

List of craters on Mars: A-G
This is a list of craters on Mars. There are hundreds of thousands of impact craters on Mars, but only some of them have names. This list here only contains named Martian craters starting with the letter A ‚Äì G (see also lists for H ‚Äì N and O ‚Äì Z).
Large Martian craters (greater than 60¬†km in diameter) are named after famous scientists and science fiction authors; smaller ones (less than 60¬†km in diameter) get their names from towns on Earth. Craters cannot be named for living people, and small crater names are not intended to be commemorative - that is, a small crater isn't actually named after a specific town on Earth, but rather its name comes at random from a pool of terrestrial place names, with some exceptions made for craters near landing sites. Latitude and longitude are given as planetographic coordinates with west longitude.

In today‚Äôs episode of Our Pour Decisions we‚Äôre going back in time to look at the legendary 2000 vintage. This was the year of the Y2K, the hanging chads, and the height of the dot.com bubble. Tiger Woods won three majors that year, and Putin, well, he was just becoming President of Russia. It seems like a lifetime ago ‚Äì and for some of us it really is. But for Bordeaux, it was the vintage that started the meteoric rise in prices. Today we‚Äôre trying Lafite, Latour, Margaux, and Mouton. How are these legendary wines developing today?

In today‚Äôs episode of Our Pour Decisions we‚Äôre going back in time to look at the legendary 2000 vintage. This was the year of the Y2K, the hanging chads, and the height of the dot.com bubble. Tiger Woods won three majors that year, and Putin, well, he was just becoming President of Russia. It seems like a lifetime ago ‚Äì and for some of us it really is. But for Bordeaux, it was the vintage that started the meteoric rise in prices. Today we‚Äôre trying Lafite, Latour, Margaux, and Mouton. How are these legendary wines developing today? Was the 2000 vintage really the greatest of all time or was there also some Bordeaux hype involved?
And stay tuned for the next episode in this series where we do a 2000 right bank tasting!

The city flourished over the centuries because of the wine trade. It is known to be the capital of wine because of having 60 appellations, 7000 winemakers, and being a home to the oldest vineyard. It‚Äôs not only a center of exquisite wineries but it‚Äôs also surrounded with profound villages to roam around as well and is flooded with culture, art and much more. The best part about this city is it‚Äôs walking friendly so you don‚Äôt have to rent a car for sightseeing.

In today‚Äôs episode of Our Pour Decisions we‚Äôre going back in time to look at the legendary 2000 vintage. This was the year of the Y2K, the hanging chads, and the height of the dot.com bubble. Tiger Woods won three majors that year, and Putin, well, he was just becoming President of Russia. It seems like a lifetime ago ‚Äì and for some of us it really is. But for Bordeaux, it was the vintage that started the meteoric rise in prices. Today we‚Äôre trying Lafite, Latour, Margaux, and Mouton. How are these legendary wines developing today? Was the 2000 vintage really the greatest of all time or was there also some Bordeaux hype involved?
And stay tuned for the next episode in this series where we do a 2000 right bank tasting!
Thanks for watching!

Bordeaux
Bordeaux (French pronunciation:¬†‚Äã[b…î Ådo]; Gascon: Bord√®u) is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France.
The municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 241,287 (2012). Together with its suburbs and satellite towns Bordeaux is the center of the Bordeaux M√©tropole, which with 737,492 inhabitants (as of 2012) is the 9th largest in France. It is the capital of the Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called "Bordelais" (for men) or "Bordelaises" (women). The term "Bordelais" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.
The city's nicknames are "La perle d'Aquitaine" (The Pearl of Aquitaine), and "La Belle Endormie" (Sleeping Beauty) in reference to the old center which had black walls due to pollution. Nowadays, this is not the case. In fact, a part of the city, Le Port de La Lune, was almost completely renovated. Bourdeaux is the city with has the highest number of preserved historical buildings in France, except for Paris.
