Dating back to 1817, the Lowell High School Review â major pupil publication â is one of the cherished traditions and institutions among the student body, as well as a revelation, at times to the faculty. Replete with features that have a personal appeal to members of all classes, and recording High School happenings from month to month. The Review is both a chron- icle of serious events and a clearing house for humor, with the  Blah  column a uni- versal favorite. Other fixtures that seem to fascinate are Anthony ' s Anecdotes, Sports, Platter Chatter, and Profiles. In The Review, variety is certainly the spice of life. The ladies and gentlemen of the press who comprise The Review Staff are selected annually at the end of their Junior year by the faculty director of the periodical, Miss Anna M. Ryan, who also serves as advisor. Ability in English and recommenda- tion of English teachers are pre-requisites in staff candidates. The Review is published at the beginning of each month of the school year and copies are sold during all recess periods by members of the staff. Its best recommenda- tion, perhaps, lies in the fact that few copies are left on the shelves. It is, indeed, the book of the month at Lowell High. 127 ”

M. C.A. and organized the Pi-Hi. A few years later the Pittsfield group dropped the original name and adopted the term Hi-Y. The Hi-Y is composed of high school boys some fifty in number. The members need not be of any special race, creed, or color, for all are welcome. The purpose of the Hi-Y is  to create, maintain, and extend throughout the school and community, high standards of Christian character through clean speech, clean living, clean scholarship, and clean sportsmanship.  The Hi-Y meets every Tuesday night during the school year. Notice of these meetings are sent out each week by the club ' s secretary. At these meetings, which are really suppers prepared by the Y ' s Women Auxiliary, a guest speaker is invited to talk to the boys. The topics on which the speakers talk vary, and include sports, the importance of good character, and the developing of a likeable personality. There are numerous social activities, the highlights, faculty night, college night and the annual Tri-Hi, Hi-Y formal. The officers, elected at the last meeting of the year, preside over the following year ' s activities. Helping and advising the boys in running things smoothly are: Paul McLaughlin of the High School Faculty and Mike Pearson, General Secretary of the Y. M. C.
