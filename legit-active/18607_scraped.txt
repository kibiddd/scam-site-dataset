EXCLUSIVE: CSI: Miami alum Sunil Nayar has inked an overall deal with ABC Studios. Under the two-year pact, which begins June 1, Nayar will develop new series projects for the studio. Additionally, he will serve as showrunner on the ABC Studios’ drama Body of Proof (formerly Body of Evidence) if the pilot written by Chris Murphey is picked up to series. Like CSI: Miami, Body of Proof is a forensic procedural. It stars Dana Delany as a tenacious medical examiner with a background as a neurosurgeon.
Nayar has been based at CBS TV Studios with two back-to-back overall deals. He spent more than five years on CSI: Miami, rising to an executive producer. He also developed several projects for the studio and most recently served as a consulting producer on the CBS/CBS Studios medial drama Three Rivers. CAA-repped Nayar started off as an assistant to Tom Fontana on Homicide before landing his first writing gig on Fontana’s HBO prison drama Oz.
