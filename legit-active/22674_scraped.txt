These were both actual stripper-themed LPs released in the 1960s (perhaps suggesting Mrs. Shorn's previous occupation?)QuotesChild: Hey. You don't have a watch on.

Although it contains a few shocking scenes (if viewed unedited) it still comes across as kind of campy. When a girl on a motorcycle p***es off a motorcycle gang the fun begins. First of all, the girl on the cute little scooter type motorcyle looks like she just finished a gig on the "Hullabaloo" TV show complete with her matching go-go boots and bikini.  She is kinda cute except she has a haircut that looks like they put a bowl on her head and cut around it.   (She could have at least wore a "Bob's Big Boy Cascade" to sex it up a bit).  She mouths off to the group of scumbags who all look like rejects from the Manson Family.One shocking scene for 1967 is the part where two gang members french kiss (they are both men)!  This is to illustrate the free-sex attitude of the era and supposedly (I am guessing here) to show what a bunch of degenerates these guys are.Jane Russell is over the top here as a drunken, floozy mother of a teenage trollop who does a strip tease in her trailer park that has to be seen to be believed.  The look on her face while stripping is somewhere between orgasmic and root canal.
