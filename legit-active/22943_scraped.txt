Event Venues & Vendors near Kansas City, MO
Everyone knows that Kansas City is famous for its barbecue and baseball team, but did you know that Kansas City has almost as many fountains as Rome, Italy and more miles of scenic boulevards than Paris, France? Imagine walking down the aisle for your dream wedding at one of the 1000 architectural structures listed in the national register of historic places.
Need a city that can accommodate your next business convention and provide incentives to bring the family along for the trip? Look no further than right here in Missouri. Kansas City is a Southwest Airlines hub offering great deals on flights from across the country to the home of Worlds of Fun – a 175-acre theme park which boasts one of the tallest and fastest steel roller coasters in the world, and then head on over for another unique adventure and cool off at Oceans of Fun, featuring a million-gallon wave pool.
