Our Mission:
Ohio Citizen Action informs, organizes, and mobilizes people to advocate for public interests across issues and campaigns. In person, by phone, and online we engage people in actions that protect public health, improve environmental quality, and benefit consumers. Our campaigns connect Ohioans and build a movement to protect democracy and create a sustainable and equitable future.
