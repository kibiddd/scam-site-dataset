Public Property Image As Image
Property Value
Image
An Image displayed on the Label. The default is null.
Examples
The following code example demonstrates how to create a Label and then to display an Image behind the Label. First, the example creates a Label and then creates an Image based on a disk file. Next, the Size property is initialized to contain the Image. Finally, the Image property is initialized to the Image.
public:
void CreateMyLabel()
{
// Create a new label and create a bitmap.
Label^ label1 = gcnew Label;
Image^ image1 = Image::FromFile( "c:\\MyImage.bmp" );
// Set the size of the label to accommodate the bitmap size.
label1->Size = System::Drawing::Size( image1->Width, image1->Height );
// Initialize the label control's Image property.
label1->Image = image1;
// ...Code to add the control to the form...
}
public void CreateMyLabel()
{
// Create a new label and create a bitmap.
Label label1 = new Label();
Image image1 = Image.FromFile("c:\\MyImage.bmp");
// Set the size of the label to accommodate the bitmap size.
label1.Size = new Size(image1.Width, image1.Height);
// Initialize the label control's Image property.
label1.Image = image1;
// ...Code to add the control to the form...
}
Private Sub CreateMyLabel()
' Create a new label and bitmap.
Dim Label1 As New Label()
Dim Image1 As Image
Image1 = Image.FromFile("c:\\MyImage.bmp")
' Set the size of the label to accommodate the bitmap size.
Label1.Size = Image1.Size
' Initialize the label control's Image property.
Label1.Image = Image1
' ...Code to add the control to the form...
End Sub
Remarks
The Image property cannot be used at the same time as the ImageList and ImageIndex properties. When the Image property is used to display an image, the ImageList and ImageIndex properties are automatically set to their default settings.
