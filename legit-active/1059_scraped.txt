About us
Host Ellen DeGeneres continues to deliver uplifting, inspiring, and hilarious experiences to viewers. Ellen's talent, personal warmth and insight have earned her recognition as a global entertainer and household name. Through her show, she brings her humor and talent for tackling topical issues into viewers' lives with her distinctive style touching every aspect of the show.
"The Ellen DeGeneres Show" has become the daytime destination for laughter and fun. Bringing a refreshing perspective to daytime television, Ellen's engaging personality and unique take on everyday life invite a relaxed and candid environment and allow her guests to engage in entertaining and thoughtful discussions on topical issues. The environment also often leads to having moments of unpredictable fun, illuminating celebrities "in the moment," and saying and doing things viewers won't experience anywhere else. When members of Hollywood's A-list and Ellen get together, anything can happen -- from dancing with First Lady Michelle Obama to Christmas caroling with Britney Spears,l to catching George Clooney after setting numerous "Clooney traps."
