Hi
We're going to a wedding in Crear in February and are looking for accommodation nearby. Any recommendations / suggestions? Also, what about taxis to and from hotels further away from Crear, itself; are there any?
Any information gratefully received.

The Kilberry Inn would be ideal, but worth checking if its open at that time of year, as it is quite remote.
Otherwise, your best bet is probably some of the hotels in Tarbert, or a farmhouse B&B. Tarbert is an attractive harbour town, with several good pubs and hotels.
I'm sure there must be reviews of these places on TripAdvisor. Have fun

You lucky people! As Peterscot says, the Kilberry Inn is very nice, but I think he's right to suggest that its closed in winter. Anyway, here's the link so you can check. http://www.kilberryinn.com/
Otherwise, it's Tarbert or Lochgilphead: Tarbert is nearer, and a pleasant fishing village to stay in. The hotels there are a mixed bag - you might do best getting a B&B and eating out - the Anchor has good food. There are taxis in Tarbert, and surprisingly (for such a remote spot) there are a few buses. See here: http://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/pdffilesstore/btt421429
In Lochgilphead I can thoroughly recommend the Corran B&B.

Thank you so much for your replies. The Kilberry Inn is shut until mid-March, so no joy there. I've had a look for places around Crear and 'Tarbert' seems to be a very confusing place, ie I've contacted some B&B's and they haven't even heard of Crear and seem to be miles away from it!
Lochgilphead seems to take an hour on the bus from Kilberry, so that might be a bit far away.
I'm getting depressed!!

Don't be depressed - it will be wonderful!
I'm not surprised they haven't heard of Crear in Tarbert - Crear is really a place, it's just a converted farm in the middle of nowhere, about 15 miles away, where they do concerts and functions. And anyway, the hotels in Tarbert are a 'mixed bag' as I said - and I was trying to be tactful!
Book a B&B in Tarbert and they will get you a taxi to Crear. Once you get to the wedding you can ask around for a lift back to civilisation by chatting up the other guests. Have a great time!

Hi again!
Does anyone know anything about Dunivaig Bed and Breakfast in Tarbert? I can't see any reviews - or any information whatsoever, actually - about this place, and just wondered, as they have vacancies when I need it.
The Cuillins B & B has also got vacancies and I've seen good reviews about that one.
I've contacted The Moorings, which is top of the list of favourite B & B's, but haven't had a reply, yet.
I've now located everything on a map and feel a little more in control!!

I've stayed at the Moorings, and probably at one or both of the others as well - I can't recall all of their names. (I stay overnight at Tarbert on my way to and from Islay). Most B&Bs in Tarbert are along Pier Road, an easy walk from the centre, and they are all much of a muchness - you can take your pick with confidence - and it's only one night anyway.
