This play forces me to appreciate both sides of the equation. On the one hand, human innovation has graced us with longer, more comfortable lives. On the other, we are taxing the planet's resources and have to learn to manage our food and energy supplies.NicknameSpongeRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentLearn more about contributingEdit page
