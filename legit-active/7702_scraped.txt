On May 24, Efrim Manuel Menuck (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Thee Silver Mt. Zion, Hotel2Tango studio) will release Plays “High Gospel”, described by Constellation as “a unique combination of short and long analog delays, biting compression and blown-out clouds of pink noise distortion.” In other words, sounds exactly like something we’d eat up here at TMT. Check out two tracks from the album above.
