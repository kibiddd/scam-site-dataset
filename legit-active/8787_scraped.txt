John Peters Ringo was born in Wayne County, Indiana in 1850. After stays in Missouri and Texas, he eventually wound up in Arizona.  He was noted in the Great Register of Cochise County in 1882 as a "speculator."  Was supposedly one of the "cowboys" who waged their war against the Earps and Doc Holliday in Tombstone.  Was not present at the "Gunfight Near the O.K. Corral."  Some think he committed suicide and there is also a preponderance of evidence that he was murdered.  The coroner's report said only that he met his death as a result of a gunshot wound to the head. Some think that the murder scene was contrived to look like it may have been suicide. Among the suspects to have killed Ringo were Wyatt Earp, Lou Cooley, and Buckskin Frank Leslie. His body was found in the crotch of a huge black oak tree approximately 5 yards from where he is now buried.
