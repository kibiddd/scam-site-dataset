Customer Reviews
Great small candy shop with a fantastic selection of candies fast and friendly serviceAndrew MailletHigh quality chocolates, bud selection.  LoCharles Dowd SrIf you like chocolate you can't go wrong here. Handcrafted little bundles of deliciousness reign supreme here. I love the toffee, the honeycombs but my favorites are the maple creams and the bridge mix. Reasonably priced (since chocolate has gotten sky high crazy), good service and well, chocolate.... How do you go wrong. They also have a good selection of non chocolate candies, maple sugar candy and more. Worth the indulgent visit.Mike CHad a problem with order on Valentine Day.  Custom order was not what I ordered.  Next day spoke to owner Caran.  She was so kind.  She immediately apologized and priority shipped next day correct order.  Will definitely be back!!  Thank you so much!!Priscilla DorrStopping by Huckleberry's Candies for candy, nuts, chocolates and gifts for closing baskets üç≠‚ù§Ô∏è Your family and friends will love your thoughtful and local gifts from Huckleberry‚Äôs Candies! Happy to feature this local favorite business on my new tide charts. Hampton Harbor tide charts available to pick up here too!üåäüåäüôåTami MallettFriendly staff, lots of options. Soooo good!Brian CuddyCandy is delicious üòã they have dark chocolate orange peels are üòã  deliciousCindy MurraySuch a cute little candy place. There's no dearth of varieties. Treat yourself to a bag of assorted candies if you're in or around the Hampton Beach area. And yeah,  don't forget the truffles!Sharanya SarkarThe people that work there are incredible individuals with a great knowledge of the products..... a must  place to visitJohn TierneyGreat selection of candy and treats.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I used to frequent Winfrey's but the chocolate is better at Huckleberry's.  You won't be disappointed.Jeffrey LaPointeVery friendly staff. Delicious candy. Would be nice if they offered a sample like Lindt or See's candies.Sydney BailyAlways helpful and friendly staff. One associate was kind enough to explain the difference in the boxes of chocolate for the holiday and helped me pick one out for my grandmother.isbell homeBest dark chocolate peanut butter cups and coconut clusters I've ever had. Just ordered a five-pound box to share with coworkers and a pound of chocolate pecan turtles to send to family.Caren is super responsive and the shop can make truly custom chocolate molds in a short turnaround time.  Not sure how many local shops can do that.Some negative reviewers seem to be missing the exact experience they had year after year with Sanborn's, but they are also clearly missing the fantastic offerings from Huckleberry's.UPDATE: Dog got into about a pound of the peanut butter cups.  Vets loaded her up with activated charcoal and, somehow, all is well.  I take full responsibility.  Dog also gives five stars.Kevin Jerram‚Äπ‚Ä∫
