(April 8, 2010) - Talk about a baptism by fire. The NSC Minnesota Stars begin their inaugural season in the USSF Division 2 Pro League Sunday night with a road match against Vancouver Whitecaps FC. With two league titles and three title game appearances since 2006, Vancouver will welcome the Stars to Swangard Stadium for a 6 p.m. CST kickoff."We fully expect them to come at us and push the game," Stars head coach Manny Lagos said. "More than likely, they're going to come out with home energy and enthusiasm, and we'll have to match them."The Whitecaps finished last season as USL First Division runner up after winning the league in 2008. With an eye toward its future in Major League Soccer, where it will begin playing in 2011, Vancouver spent the past offseason making some significant upgrades to its roster, bolstering an already strong midfield with former Minnesota Thunder playmaker Ricardo Sanchez. Sanchez was a fan favorite during his time with the Thunder, and in 2009 he was second on the team with seven goals and led the league with eight assists."Ricardo is a very talented player," Lagos said. "He's got a great left foot, and he's somebody we're going to have to keep an eye out for throughout the game."Fans can watch Sunday's game - and all USSF D-2 Pro League games this season - online for free.

It's a quality that Del Do said he's always tried to emulate."I'm a strong believer that hard work pays off," Del Do said.
