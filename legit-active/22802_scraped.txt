Tamil cinema
The cinema of Tamil Nadu is a part of Indian cinema, producing films in the Tamil language. Based in the Kodambakkam district of Chennai, India, the industry is colloquially referred to as Kollywood, the term being a portmanteau of the words Kodambakkam and Hollywood.
The first silent film in Tamil, Keechaka Vadham, was made by R. Nataraja Mudaliar in 1916. The first talkie was a multi-lingual, Kalidas, which released on 31 October 1931, barely 7 months after India's first talking picture Alam Ara By the end of the 1930s, the legislature of the State of Madras passed the Entertainment Tax Act of 1939. Tamil cinema later had a profound effect on other filmmaking industries of India, establishing Chennai as a secondary hub for Bollywood, other regional film industries in South India, as well as Sri Lankan cinema. In its modern era, Tamil films from Chennai have been distributed to various overseas theaters in Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.
The industry also inspired independent filmmaking in Tamil diaspora populations in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Western Hemisphere.

Ramarajan is an Indian Tamil film Actor, Writer and Director who specialised in acting and directing films on village-based subjects. He is also known as Makkal Nayagan. Many of his films were successful. He was called the rural box office king in the late 1980s. He is known for his colourful gaudy costumes and excessive makeup. His pairings with Rekha and Gauthami in Tamil cinema were his biggest hits. He has worked in more than 40 films and has directed more than 10 films.
Ramarajan hails from a small town Melur situated near Madurai. He grew up from a Cinema entrance ticket validator and plantain seller to a cinema producer.[1][1] Known for his films with rustic simplicity, he had disappeared from filmdom following a string of failures. His films were so popular and made big at box-offices that they were equally competent to Superstar Rajinikanth and Kamalhassan's films. Considered as the man of the rural audiences, he was nicknamed Vasool Chakravathi. Many of his films based on village-based subjects were a big hit in B and C centres. He is known for his dark shirts and colourful costumes. His film Karagattakaran was a block buster which ran for 365 days in Madurai and in Chennai.
In the late 1990s, Ramarajan's career began to falter with several of his films failing at the box office or becoming stalled. His Anbe Vaa and Annan had a delayed release, while films such as Sathya Thaai with Suvaluxmi, Thambikku Thaai Manasu with Sanghavi and Kannuppada Povvudhu were cancelled midway through shoot.[2] Another project Madurai Thangam which was launched in 2006 was also shelved.[3]
He took a plunge in politics and managed to become an MP. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Tiruchendur constituency on the AIADMK ticket in 1998.[1] His film and political career both failed for a certain period.[4] His last low budget film Medhai got released on 2012 which largely went unnoticed and failed.

Ramarajan is an Indian Tamil film Actor, Writer and Director who specialised in acting and directing films on village-based subjects. He is also known as Makkal Nayagan. Many of his films were successful. He was called the rural box office king in the late 1980s. He is known for his colourful gaudy costumes and excessive makeup. His pairings with Rekha and Gauthami in Tamil cinema were his biggest hits. He has worked in more than 40 films and has directed more than 10 films.
Ramarajan hails from a small town Melur situated near Madurai. He grew up from a Cinema entrance ticket validator and plantain seller to a cinema producer.[1][1] Known for his films with rustic simplicity, he had disappeared from filmdom following a string of failures. His films were so popular and made big at box-offices that they were equally competent to Superstar Rajinikanth and Kamalhassan's films. Considered as the man of the rural audiences, he was nicknamed Vasool Chakravathi. Many of his films based on village-based subjects were a big hit in B and C centres. He is known for his dark shirts and colourful costumes. His film Karagattakaran was a block buster which ran for 365 days in Madurai and in Chennai.
In the late 1990s, Ramarajan's career began to falter with several of his films failing at the box office or becoming stalled. His Anbe Vaa and Annan had a delayed release, while films such as Sathya Thaai with Suvaluxmi, Thambikku Thaai Manasu with Sanghavi and Kannuppada Povvudhu were cancelled midway through shoot.[2] Another project Madurai Thangam which was launched in 2006 was also shelved.[3]
He took a plunge in politics and managed to become an MP. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Tiruchendur constituency on the AIADMK ticket in 1998.[1] His film and political career both failed for a certain period.[4] His last low budget film Medhai got released on 2012 which largely went unnoticed and failed.
