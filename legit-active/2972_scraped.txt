Farmland Information Center
The nation’s largest online collection for information on farm and ranch land protection and stewardship.
About the Farmland Information Center
The Farmland Information Center (FIC) is a clearinghouse for information about farmland protection that serves people working to save farmland and ranchland for agriculture. It is a project of American Farmland Trust (AFT) maintained on behalf of and with support from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The FIC is authorized by the federal Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA), the first federal law to address the loss of productive agricultural land to non-farm development. AFT and NRCS have worked together since 1994 to fulfill this requirement.
