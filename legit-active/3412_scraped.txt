Cézanne, Paul: The Mont Sainte-Victoire and Bibemus saga
The Sainte-Victoire mountain near Cézanne's home in Aix-en-Provence
was one of his favorite subjects and he is known to have painted it
over 60 times. Cézanne was fascinated by the rugged architectural forms in
the mountains of Provence and painted the same scene from many different
angles. He would use bold blocks of color to achieve a new spatial effect
known as ``flat-depth'' to accommodate the unusual geological forms of the
mountains. Cézanne travelled widely in the Provence region and also
enjoyed painting the coast at L'Estaque.
