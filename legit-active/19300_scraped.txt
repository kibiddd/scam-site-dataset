Growing up in Philadelphia, far removed from spectacular natural landscapes, there was still inspiration to be found in many places. It all started with a natural curiosity of science; pictured encyclopedias, visits to places like the Benjamin Franklin Museum of Science, the New York Museum of Natural History, the Academy of Natural Sciences, aquariums, zoos, and a cousin, Harry, who had a darkroom in his basement. Following a biology degree from Quinnipiac College in the 70's, came a fork in the road. I had to decide whether to pursue biomedical photography or medicine. As it turned out, pursuing medicine with a career in pathology, would blend photography in an extraordinary way to see the world through the lens of a camera, and the lens of a microscope. Forensic pathology added another unexpected, otherworldly dimension. I contemplate the lyrics of a song by the late George Harrison titled: "Any Road". The song was reportedly inspired by a beach sign in Hawaii that read, "if the wind blows, you can always adjust your sails",  which inspired  if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there. I've been fortunate along my journey to pursue my interests wherever they have led me, I hope you enjoy the images and thoughts I've made along the way.RobPhotographyLandscape and Nature Photography of Colorado and Beyond PhotographyForensic PathologyForensic Pathology Services, Commentary, and PhotomicroscopyForensic Pathology  Blog  Rob Kurtzman - Palisade, COCopyright © 1998 Rob Kurtzman - All Rights Reserved.
