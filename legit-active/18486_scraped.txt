World Leading Flight Training Organization to Integrate Ascent(R) Jet Trainer(TM) and Ascent(R) Flight Trainer(TM) in MPL Curriculum
MONTREAL, Aug. 31 /PRNewswire/ - Mechtronix Systems Inc., an MWC company, a world leading manufacturer of Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD), today announced the purchase of two FSTD's by Oxford Aviation Academy (OAA) for their Australian training center based in Melbourne, VIC. The order consists of an Ascent(R) Jet Trainer(TM) and an Ascent(R) Flight Trainer(TM); the first is configured as a regional jet and will be used for MCC training in a jet environment and jet orientation courses while the second will be used for IR training. It closely replicates a Cessna C172S. Both units are ideally suited to meet the challenges of MCC and MPL implementation in Australia and will be installed in the course of 2010.
"We selected Mechtronix' FSTD's for our Australian base as once again they proved to have the best product offering matching our specific requirements," said Mr. Anthony Petteford, OAA's Managing Director. "We trust them to have the most innovative training tools with the highest level of fidelity which is crucial for our determination to offer quality-oriented flight courses and raise training standards in Australia. Many factors were key in our decision to renew our trust in Mechtronix, such as their worldwide references as well as their experience and involvement with schools offering MPL programs. We already use Ascent(R) Jet Trainers(TM) at our training base in the UK and we knew this equipment would work well in the Australian context."
"We are very excited to work again with a top-flight aviation academy like OAA and develop our list of references in Australia", said Mechtronix Systems President Hervé. "OAA is a longstanding customer and their renewed trust in our technology testifies of the efficiency of our simulation solutions in the long term. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art flight training solutions will be a key component in OAA's effort to implement MCC and MPL high quality training standards in Australia."
The Ascent(R) Jet Trainer(TM), configured as a Regional Jet, will provide exceptional fidelity via a RSI Image Generator as well as an extended visual library representing Australian airports. Featuring fully functional FMS with RNAV and GNSS approach capabilities, the FSTD will familiarize the students with the advanced automated flight deck environment. The device will be qualified JAR FSTD A FNPT II MCC under EASA regulations and will be compliant with ICAO FSTD Type 2 requirements. The Ascent(R) Flight Trainer(TM), reflecting the newest "S" version of the Cessna 172, will integrate real Garmin 1044B GDU enabling the students to train for IR in a high fidelity environment. The unit will meet and exceed FTD Level 5 as per FAA 14 CFR Part 60 Change 1 equivalent to JAR-FSTD A FNPT II. Both FSTD's will be inspected by the British Civil Aviation Authorities (UK CAA).
