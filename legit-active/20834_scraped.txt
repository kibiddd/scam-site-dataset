“Basically, I’m trying to cram everyones name in the entertainment business in 90 minutes while making it rhyme all at the same time. Throw in a few ’64 Impala references along with a few Air Max ’95 lyrics, and you got a classic right here.” – The Game

The album is dope and i love how everyone continues to clown but the fact of the matter is…. if it wasnt dope, we wouldnt be sitting here looking at the posts, let alone all the posts that have been up lately! yes name dropping is annoying but when hes not name dropping, its DOPE!!! Especially the way the CD flows together! And listen to his interviews, he admits that he jocks ppls flow and he admits that its not Watch The Throne or C4. #REALNIGGASHIT PLUS I KNOW U SEE HIM FUCKING CATS UP IN THE CLUBS!!!! LMFAO

Eehh. With all his Wacky actions on the Side.
Overall it was an Alright album.
If your on Games Nuts and say it’s album of the Year or “you dont know what good music is”
you might as well cut your Balls off!
Its a cool album. not the Best Game album, but pretty decent. not much his usual west coast Style he should of sticked with. or at Least keep going the same route as L.A.X.

I’m not hating on Game. It’s all in good fun. Let’s not forget he came out the gate “hatin” on other artists while promoting this album. He seems like a good dude though. Just not a fan of his antics.

Pushing the envelope??? Bragging about you’re jewelry and money is not “Pushing the envelope,” maybe production wise…. just maybe.
And If I’m skimming through the music? Then you’re listening too hard, cause you’re hearing things that aren’t there pimpin……
Also, making a reference to another artist or setting up a line and finishing with an artist name is not name dropping for the sake of name dropping. That’s his style…… listen carefully to the lines where he references other artist names…tell me they don’t make sense in the context of the song or bar…

The album is dope bottom line. Antics need too stop tho. I thought Game was lying for promotion but the album is #1 on itunes. Its better than WTT if you want a hardcore hip hop album.
@Jaymalls you going to far with the push the envelope comment. WTT was a good album but its simply just Jay and Ye doing them.

Definitely gives you another perspective on the album.  Wish more rappers and bands did this more often.  No doubt at all that Game is a real fan of hip hop.

THE REAL DEAL IS>>>>>>>>>>>
THIS ALBUM WAS DOPE. I REALLY FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT, THE GAME PUTS OUT NOTHING BUT CLASSICS WHEN IT COMES TO HIS ALBUMS. SURE, HE HAS HIS WACK TRACKS EVERY NOW AND THEN, A LOT OF THINGS HE DOES PERSONALLY IS BITCH MADE WITH THE JAY Z SHIT TALKING , BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HIM WORKING HARD ON A ALBUM…HES PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST TO DO IT CONSISTENTLY IN THE LAST 7 YEARS.  NOT A FAN OF A LOT OF THE FEATURES ON HERE , BUT SOMEHOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER IN A GOOD WAY.
OVERALL: 7/10, SOME FEATURES ON THERE ARE SO ANNOYING THAT I HAVE TO FAST FORWARD THERE PARTS ESPECIALLY OFFICER RICKY. DRAKES VERSE WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST STANDOUT FEATURES ON THERE.
GO AHEAD AND HATE

Chan says:
I come here to hate on Game because Game ask for it. He is a attention hoe, a biopolor lunatic, and a shitty rapper. Yes I hate on Game. I wouldn’t hate if I wasn’t constantly reminded by games pathetic attempts at attention and shitty songs, e.i, Pot of Gold. “Im famous and I wish I wasn’t” Boo Hoo. Seriously the guys an asshole. Cool dude your a blood. Who cares. Quiks a blood but doesn’t feel the need to make that the focal point of his music. Why? Because Quik is a REAL artist whose music holds its own. I love west coast rap. There is a lot of old talent and new talent in California. Games not on that list. period.
