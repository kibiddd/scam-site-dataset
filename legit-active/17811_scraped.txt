Izzy was back at it again today, but this time solo. She did very well and the judge had nothing but advice for getting better. She ended up with the best score possible: superior.

Izzy’s “The Flutes” Score Superior Rating
Posted on February 21, 2020  by  Jason
Reply
This evening Izzy participated in her first county flute ensemble competition. They sounded great, but got a little out of sync near the end of their musical piece. However, they still scored the best score you can get: superior.

We Escaped The Playground
Posted on December 26, 2019  by  Jason
Reply
Our vacation escape room adventures continued today with a visit to The Playground. We joined up with a family of seven from North Carolina in order to get all of our grades so that we could make it to the dodge ball tournament on time. There was so many people in the room, it helped to break up into groups and solve multiple puzzles at the same time. We finished with five minutes to spare.

Abby Lands in London
Posted on August 28, 2019  by  Jason

For Abby’s first semester at Florida State, she is studying abroad in London, England. What a great opportunity for her to learn a whole new culture without having to learn a foreign language. I haven’t been this nervous since we put Abby on the school bus for her first day of kindergarten.
She flew out last night and then landed at 2:00 a.m. EST, or 7:00 a.m. London time. She made her way through customs and then to the Florida State study center where she will be staying.
She said she’s loving her flat and getting to know her flatmates. So far, so good to her 3 month adventure in London, England. She starts school on Monday.

We Didn’t Escape Prison
Posted on July 26, 2019  by  Jason

Abby had a day off from being a lifeguard down at the Oviedo pool, so we decided to spend that time in prison, an escape room prison that is. It was a challenge for six people, but the other two people didn’t show up, so we tackled it on our own. We also found out that it’s their toughest room, but we felt we were up for the challenge.
We started out in two separate cells and had to work together in order to get a key to our jail cells. One was a magnetic maze that me and Izzy could see and had to convey the direction Abby and Emily had to go on the other size in their cell. Once out, we had to figure out a few more puzzles to get through some doors. There were colored pipes and we had to look through them at hash marks on the wall in order to tell the combination to a lock. Then, we had to key in some switches to some tic-tac-toe puzzles that were around the room. A few more puzzles later and we slid down into our final room. With only ten minutes left, we didn’t have enough time to finish. We had two puzzles left when time was up.
It was a trough room, but we had fun. I thought we did a good job for down two people and it being their toughest room.

Musicians of the Galaxy
Posted on June 12, 2019  by  Jason
Reply
This past week Izzy attended the Seminole County Summer band camp for the third time. Big change from when she had only been playing the flute for eight days. The camp was themed around Guardians of the Galaxy and they all had shirts made up that said Musicians of the Galaxy. I was blown away by their rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody and they also played a medley of songs from Guardians of the Galaxy.

Happy Birthday, Izzy!

Today Izzy turns 14 years old! I can’t believe it. She’s finished seventh grade and is moving up to eighth grade in the fall. This past weekend she wanted to have fish for dinner, unique in our family, so we all went to Bonefish Grill and had a nice dinner. Emily even had shrimp and I had crab cakes with my steak. Later that evening we celebrated with cake and took some Polaroids of the festivities.
