(Hryhorii Hladiy), moved from Lviv to Kyiv upon completing high school
and graduated from the Karpenko-Karyi Theater Institute with a degree
in acting and cinema. Impelled by an interest in directing, he enrolled
in the directors' program at the State Institute of Theatre Arts in
Moscow, where he studied under the tutelage of the gifted Russian
director, Anatoly Vassiliev. As one of Vassiliev's outstanding
graduates he quickly became one of the most sought-after stage and
cinema actors and directors in Eastern Europe.However, Hlady's approach to theater was not well received by the
Soviet authorities. So, in 1989 he left Kyiv for Tallinn, Estonia. In
1990, however, a contract to perform in "Six Characters in Search of an
Author" took him to Montreal. His French-language production of Franz
Kafka's "Amerika" brought him critical acclaim in both Montreal and
Brussels. But it was his production of Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming" that
won him Quebec Theater Critics' Award for best directing in the
1991-1992 season.While directing plays as diverse as Dostoyevsky's "The Idiot"
(Lausanne, Switzerland), Ionesco's "Exit the King" and Sophocles'
"Electra" (Montreal), Hlady has also conducted master classes in
Austria, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Ukraine. In 2000 he
rejoined Vassiliev's company to play Salieri in "Salieri and Mozart" in
Rome. Last year, he appeared in a Paramount film, The Sum of All Fears (2002) and this
year, he plays the lead in Kim Nguyern's new feature film, Le marais (2002).Currently, the Ukrainian actor is appearing in Paula de Vasconcelos'
Montreal theatre production of "The Other". Mr. Hlady speaks English,
French, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian, and makes his home
in Montreal.BornDecember 4, 1954More at IMDbProContact infoAgent infoResumeBornDecember 4, 1954IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to listView contact info at IMDbPro
