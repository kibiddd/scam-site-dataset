If you have toy train questions, a Contact link is provided on all pages.On my site you'll find information about building and maintaining Lionel and Kusan O gauge toy train layouts. There's also narrative and photos for Lionel, Kusan, American Model Toys (AMT), Kris (KMT), Newbraugh Brothers Toys, Frank's Roundhouse, Williams, K-LINE, Western Coil and other toy trains.

Search tip: less is better. For example, type "237" instead of "# 237 steam engine."
Special thanks to Charles Wilber for providing the Lionel Trains Horizontal Rules and various other graphics appearing my pages. Charles also created a Hobo Signs page for my website. And a big thank you to Joe R. for animating my first toy train set at the top of this page and helping with my train layout track plan.
