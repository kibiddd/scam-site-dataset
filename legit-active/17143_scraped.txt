HARE-BRAISING TALE IS LOONY?

That’s the lesson from an anonymous prankster who promises to kill and cook his pet rabbit, Toby, unless he gets $50,000 in donations by June 30.
“I don’t want to eat Toby, he is my friend, and he has always been the most loving, adorable pet,” wrote the person behind savetoby.com. “However, God as my witness, I will devour this little guy unless I receive $50,000.”
The site features pictures of an adorable, sandy-haired, floppy-eared Toby, as well as recipes fit for Elmer Fudd – braised rabbit, rabbit confit and rabbit stew. It claims $19,762.15 has been raised in donations and sales of T-shirts and coffee mugs.
Toby’s owner is shielded behind a web of cybersecurity, and he didn’t respond to an E-mail message from the Daily News.
But several other sites, including snopes.com, have declared savetoby.com’s tale of a bunny hopping on borrowed time as a hoax – in part by noting the words “humor . . . funny . . . jokes” buried in hidden coding on the site. Some animal-rights groups and rabbit lovers have tried to shut down savetoby.com without success – but they note that Toby might not really exist. Yet references to savetoby.com on the Internet are multiplying like . . . well, you know.
