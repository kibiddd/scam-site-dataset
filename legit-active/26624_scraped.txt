This year we took on the monumental task of reskinning our website, which was a massive undertaking but one that was well worth the effort. We simplified navigation, consolidated pages, and completely restructured the way our beers and beverages are organized. My favorite part is the effort we put into bringing in more personality and photography to each brand's page; taking the opportunity to showcase not only the product descriptions but showing consumers how can interact with each brand. Oh, and how could I forget...now it works on MOBILE.
Huge shout out to Propaganda3 for their patience and flexibility!
