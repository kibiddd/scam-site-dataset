About Ummah Forum – A Brief History
Welcome to the Ummah Forum, a vibrant and engaging online community for Muslims around the world. We are excited to have you here and would like to share a brief history of Ummahforum.
Ummah Forum was initially set up in 2001, with the primary goal of providing a safe and welcoming platform for Muslims to engage in discussions, seek advice, and share knowledge about various aspects of Islam and daily life. Over the years, the forum has grown significantly, and at its peak, it boasted over 100,000 active members from all corners of the globe.
Our members have contributed to a rich tapestry of topics ranging from Islamic theology, history, and jurisprudence to more practical aspects of daily life, such as marriage, parenting, and personal development.
The Ummah Forum has always been a place where Muslims can come together to learn from each other, ask questions, and make lasting friendships as well as more than a few ummah forum marriage stories.
Unfortunately, in early 2023, the original Ummah Forum was wiped due to unforeseen circumstances. But as the saying goes, “With every hardship comes ease.” This setback has paved the way for the creation of a new and improved Ummah Forum that you see today. We have put in our best efforts to preserve the essence of the original forum and we hope that you will join us to make it the lively and engaging community it has been for so many years.

We are slowly working to rebuilt some of the more popular content from the old forum, and in addition to the ummah.com forum, we are also excited to announce that we will be sharing new content and articles on our main site. This will include informative and engaging articles on various Islamic topics, fun Islamic quizzes, lifestyle content and contemporary issues that matter to our community.
We invite you to explore the new Ummah Forum and contribute to our ever-growing community. Let’s continue the tradition of learning, sharing, and connecting with our fellow Muslims from around the world.
Thank you for being a part of the Ummah Forum family, and we look forward to your valuable contributions!
Warm regards,
The Ummah Forum Team
