Due to a major knee injury, Cyr endured a two-year absence for the NHL in
the late 1980s. In total, he had to miss the remainder
of 1988-89 season, the 1989 playoffs and entire 1989-90 season with a torn
ACL and MCL in right knee, an injury suffered when he missed a check on Steve Thomas
in N.Y. Rangers' Oct. 6, 1988,
season-opener at Chicago. The injury required major reconstructive surgery
in October 1988 and again in August 1989. In the second surgery, doctors
re-routed three muscles in Cyr's knee. Part of his kneecap was also
removed, and the knee was held together with two screws and a pin to
help it heal. In February 1990, the Rangers told Cyr he would be
released after the season, and he was finally released in July 1990. Because
Cyr's agent, Bill Watters, was friendly with Hartford general manager Ed Johnston, the
Whalers invited invited Cyr to their 1990 training camp on a free-agent tryout
basis and promised him a fair shot at making the team. He made the roster,
signed with the Whalers as an unrestricted free agent on Sept. 30, 1990,
and finally returned to action in Hartford's Oct. 4, 1990, season-opener
vs. Quebec --  having
missed 159 consecutive games over two seasons.
NON-NHL CAREER
Post-Draft Teams:
Victoria (WHL); Springfield (AHL)World Junior Championships: 1983 (bronze medal)NON-NHL
AWARDS AND HONORSMiscellaneous: Did not play his
first minor-league games until he was demoted to Springfield (AHL) by
Hartford early in 1991-92 season.Shot on Vacation: Cyr survived a
scare on May 20, 1987, when he was shot in the abdomen while vacationing
in the Dominican Republic. The incident took place during an attempted
robbery. Cyr, then 23, fought off the would-be robbers, who managed to shoot
him in the side of his body. The bullet did not cause a major injury, and he
recovered from the gunshot within a few weeks. Cyr and his fiancee, Cheryl
Pera, were inside a taxi at 9:30 p.m. on the night of the robbery, as they
were headed to watch a weightlifting competition. The taxi pulled over at
the site of an apparent bus accident, which turned out to be an in-progress
hijacking. Two men and a woman had forced the bus off the road in order to
rob the passengers. When they saw the taxi coming at them, they decided to
rob the occupants and then seize the taxi to flee the scene. The female
hijacker held a bayonet to Pera's throat and demanded her necklace. Cyr
pushed the bayonet away from his fiancee, and one of the men pointed his gun
at Pera. As the man hesitated to shoot, Cyr grabbed the gun and fought with
the man in the front seat of the cab. While he was wrestling for the gun,
Cyr was shot. Dominican police praised Cyr as a hero for foiling the
robbery. "I wish I was remembered for being a 50-goal scorer rather than
getting shot by a guy yelling Spanish and demanding pesos," Cyr later said.Personal: Full name is Paul A. Cyr.
... Uncle of former NHL player Jason Bowen.
HOW HE GOT AWAY

Buffalo traded Cyr and 1988 10th-round pick (Eric Fenton) to N.Y. Rangers in
