A creative hub, Montreal's artistic elite pack the cafes along Rue Saint-Denis, where young painters and fashion designers draw inspiration from the playful murals and stately Victorian homes that dot the Plateau's side streets. Not a major sightseeing destination, a visit to Plateau Mont-Royal allows you to enjoy a local perspective, soaking in indie films, latte art, contemporary galleries, and the city's best bagels. A center of polyglot culture, Québécois accents mingle with shades of Portuguese, Greek, and Hebrew in the area's iconic Mile End district, where restaurants straddle chic designer boutiques, serving up chorizo and caldo verde. Friendliest to those on foot, it's a jungle of colorful awnings and sidewalk umbrellas, pedestrian walks and luxury shopping.Read moreHow to get thereBeaubien • 9 min walkReach out directlyVisit websiteEmailFull viewBest nearbyRestaurants3,613 within 3 milesCorneli4.24.2 of 5 bubbles(335)0.2 mi$$ - $$$ • Italian • Pizza • Vegetarian friendlyJaja Restaurant4.34.3 of 5 bubbles(306)518 ft$$$$ • Italian • French • Vegetarian friendlyDamas Restaurant4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(1,614)0.6 mi$$$$ • Mediterranean • Healthy • Vegetarian friendlyChez Gus4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(108)432 ft$$ - $$$ • French • Steakhouse • Vegetarian friendlyVices et Versa4.34.3 of 5 bubbles(146)298 ft$$ - $$$ • Bar • Pub • Vegetarian friendlyIl Bazzali4.64.6 of 5 bubbles(121)0.2 mi$$ - $$$ • Italian • Mediterranean • Vegetarian friendlyIle Flottante4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(882)0.7 mi$$$$ • French • Contemporary • Vegetarian friendlyBottega Pizzeria4.04 of 5 bubbles(371)0.2 mi$$ - $$$ • Italian • Pizza • Vegetarian friendlyDinette Triple Crown4.44.4 of 5 bubbles(151)0.2 mi$$ - $$$ • AmericanImpasto4.14.1 of 5 bubbles(255)0.2 mi$$$$ • Italian • Mediterranean • Vegetarian friendlySee allAttractions739 within 6 milesMarché Jean-talon (jean-talon Market)4.54.5 of 5 bubbles(1,940)0.4 miFarmers MarketsMile End4.44.4 of 5 bubbles(270)0.6 miBallets • NeighborhoodsRue St. Denis4.24.2 of 5 bubbles(450)0.5 miPoints of Interest & LandmarksMusée du Montréal juif - Museum of Jewish Montreal4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(416)0.8 miSpeciality MuseumsNotre-Dame Basilica4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(20,453)Points of Interest & Landmarks • Churches & CathedralsOld Montreal4.54.5 of 5 bubbles(13,883)Points of Interest & LandmarksSt. Louis Square (Carré St-Louis)4.14.1 of 5 bubbles(78)0.3 miPoints of Interest & Landmarks • ParksNotre-Dame-de-la-Défense4.64.6 of 5 bubbles(8)0.3 miChurches & CathedralsNostra Madonna della Difesa4.34.3 of 5 bubbles(7)0.3 miReligious SitesWills3.03 of 5 bubbles(1)0.3 miBreweriesSee allContributeWrite a reviewUpload a photoReviewsQ&AFiltersEnglishMost RecentMost Recent: Reviews ordered by most recent publish date in descending order.

Not too much around here that is truly interesting or worth making a special trip to see. A few churches, a couple of parks. Saw the Bocce Ball courts in one park, but it had little kids and daycare adults just hanging out in it. Not really much for shops or restaurants. The neighborhood seemed nearly abandoned. Though the walk itself was pleasant enough.Read moreWritten August 22, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I actually don’t come every year however maybe I should because it was very pleasant.   Little Italy in Montreal is obviously known for its great café places as well as it fine dining Italy restaurants.   The street was filled with vendors.   They had a scopa card competition; they also had two stages with Italian music.   It was a very nice experience and I highly recommend a visit especially when there are festivals because there are a lot of things happening in the area.   I must add that parking is very difficult to find during festivals, you need to pay attention to the parking signs and restrictions.Read moreWritten August 24, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Walk the streets and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere and duck into one of many little cafés or authentic pizza restos. Jean-Talon market is also a must!

Blocks if fresh everything at great prices and all kinds of prepared food to be eaten or taken home. There is a pasta maker that prepares plates of fresh made pasta that was a great surprise. If you enjoy food at any level this is something to see.Read moreWritten October 21, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

ThanksRead moreWritten July 14, 2018Kevin BKemptville, Canada1,275 contributions-1Ok...I don’t know why people are saying that there are not a lot of Italian restaurants in Ottawa’s Little Italy...I disagree. I went to Little Italy in Montreal and we ended up eating in some South American restaurant...I wasn’t impressed. As for Ottawa, here are a couple of recommendations. If you are out and about and just want a sandwich...you have to go to Di Rienzo Deli...don’t let the outside or inside fool you...the best sandwiches in Ottawa...I guarantee it...and all for 6 bucks taxes in!. My wife and I went to La Roma restaurant and very much enjoyed it. We also very much like La Favorita. You can’t go wrong with either place...don’t listen to those other reviews...they obviously didn’t look around.Read moreWritten July 14, 2018AnswerDiane M31 contributionsI’m thinking of moving to Little Italy   Do you know what day time activities, for adults, are available?
