A memory came to me this morning and I looked him up. Pete was a good man. A Great Father and a Great Drummer.  He was a good friend to my late father as well.  Gods Speed. Your memory remains eternal.Tom LinardosFebruary 1, 2013Peter, I first remember you in Chicago when you were coming to our house as a teenager for your drum lessons from my dad.  As you developed your skills with the drums your charming personality also grew closer to our hearts; as time passed we attended your wedding to April and then we officially became part of your family when my father and I baptized little Jimmy, unfortunately we moved away to Canada, lost touch and unfortunately we missed these last years of your life.  I miss your smile Pete, your personality and I will always remember talking to you on the phone on those last difficult days you had.  I hope you are at peace now, I will always remember you Pete.Joe SurrattJanuary 10, 2011Pete lived across the alley back in the day. We lived on Superior street. Pete lived on Chicago Avenue. He was a friend of my sister Carol. He was a very good drummer from what I can remember. Pete is the first person that influenced my decision for playing drums. I am deeply sorry to read of Pete's departure.Cheri CroninNovember 12, 2010I have been thinking about Peter for months! He used to call me every couple months - every time - he'd say "what you don't call me no more?" - I wish I would have called him more   :(  He was such a sweet guy (and funny!)  He will be missed!!Sherry KeleghanApril 20, 2009Dear Pete:It was with great sadness I learned you had left us here on earth.  It was my gift to have had some time to spend with you.  What courage you displayed, what a great love for your family too.  Thank you for sharing with me those special parts of your life..your family, your love and appreciation of music and the old record shop, Oak Park, and where you used to climb up to see April at her parents home when you were dating, Nashville and Memphis (Elvis and Graceland), that silly way you snapped your fingers, watching together non-stop The Thornbirds, and going to meet my Mom and going horseback riding.  You made me laugh and sometimes cry but I’ll always remember you and hold you close in my heart and prayers.Love,Sherry KeleghanBrenda PutnamApril 4, 2009Peter touched many including myself I am saddened by his passing but yet glad he is no longer suffering. My prayers are with all he left behind.Omar ZayyadApril 1, 2009Dear Pete; I am so sorry to hear you left us. You are a great friend. We met at work, and we played raquetteball every week in the late 1990's. You always wore a warm smile. You had something pleasant to say every time I saw you, and when we played ball, you were a fierce competitor, but with sportsmanship reserved only for knights. I will greatly miss our friendship, and will always remember you. To your family, please accept my sincerest expressions of sympathy for the loss of truly wonderful man. God bless you all.Rev. David and Mrs Patty Jo YountMarch 30, 2009To the family and friends of Peter Mestousis:  It was a joy and honor for my wife and me to minister to Peter from the time he began attending New Hope Church.  He was always eager to know more of the Bible and to share with others the joy of knowing Christ in a personal way.  As his pastor, I had the joy of going through the 12 basic discipleship lessons that we had developed and had encouraged others, in turn, to use the same lessons with another in one-on-one sharing.  Peter memorized the twelve suggested memory verses as well as other verses that had touched his heart.  He requested believer's baptism by immersion. Right away, he found a new neighbor to whom he shared the 12 disicipleship lessons.  It was so neat because that man was a seminary graduate and Peter was a recent born-again Christian. Peter demonstrates to us all that it is never too late to learn.  Up until the time the Lord called Peter home, we spoke almost daily on the phone even though in August we had moved to Tustin, California. We look forward to seeing Peter again at throne of our Lord Jesus Christ, see First Thessalonians 4:13-18.   Rev. and Mrs. David W. YountNila DimangondayaoMarch 30, 2009We would like to invite all who knew Peter to a memorial service in his honor at New Hope Church, 5100 W. 115th St. in Alsip, IL on April 3 (Friday) at 7:00 pm. If you have any questions, please call 708-824-9190.Stacy Carbonara (Lenik)March 20, 2009I am so sorry to hear of your loss. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help at this time. Please accept my deepest condolences.Tom & Betty LenikMarch 19, 2009Sorry to here about my friends passing.I lived across the alley from him and any time I needed a hand doing something I just asked for Pete the Greek from asross the street and he was there. I will miss him.Stacy & Joe Carbonara (Lenik)March 19, 2009Dear Mestousis Family,I am so sorry for your loss. Pete was like a second father to me growing up. He always made people laugh and was always there to help you when you needed it. He will be missed. May he rest in peace.Nicole LangMarch 17, 2009Dear Mestousis family~ I am so sorry for your loss.  You have endured so much heartache recently.  At least you know they are at peace in heaven with one another.  My deepest sympathy to you all.Joe JanovjakMarch 17, 2009Dear April, Jimmy, Nicki, Carole and family,    I am very sad to hear about Pete's final passing.  I had the honor of being his friend and fellow musician for the last 29 years.  He was a good man who loved his family and his friends.  We had many an interesting philosophical conversation over the years.  We also had the pleasure of playing music together.  I am sure that he is organizing a "honking" jam session in Heaven.  Please accept my deepest condolences.Glen PappasMarch 16, 2009Pete was a co-worker of mine. I only knew him for a couple of years. But in that short time I learned he was the most courageous person I ever met. He was always upbeat and always had a good word to say to everyone. I'm glad I got a chance to meet and work with him. We will really miss him. He's in a better place now with God. Rest in peace Pete."Pete the Greek" and his family 1979March 16, 2009Maria, Uncle Pete, Auntie Tootie Greek Easter 08'March 16, 2009Pete & Papou 2008March 16, 2009Nick and Pete Sept.2000March 16, 2009Nick and Pete 1960March 16, 2009Sharon AlexanderMarch 16, 2009I met Pete through my husband who was a co-worker with him.

The thoughts of many are with you at this time of sorrow.Julie Gieffers-KaneMarch 16, 2009I was very saddened to see Pete's name in the obituaries.  54 is so young!  Although I have not seen or spoken to Pete in years, I remember him as being a great guy!  He and I worked together in a band called, "Good Sounds."  I was only 18 at the time and was treated with great respect.  With Pete and the band, not only did I learn a lot about music, I also learned a lot about Greek weddings and Berwyn!  I remember that he often talked about his family.  He even helped me when I was a music major in college and had to learn about the drums.  What a great guy!  My deepest sympathies go out to his family.  I am so sorry for your loss.Pete and his drum student ViaEd & Nila DimangondayaoMarch 16, 2009Our family was blessed with Pete's friendship. He not only was a great musician--he so unselfishly shared his expertise with whomever wanted to learn some tricks on the drums. He mentored our daughter Via. She is now carrying on as main drummer for Sunday morning worship at New Hope Church. Pete's excellent artistry, his zest for life, his loyal friendship and the joy that lit up his face as we served together on the worship team at New Hope Church--these memories will stay with us forever. We could imagine Pete playing with the band as they play the fanfare when our turn comes to enter heaven's gates.Christmas 2004March 15, 2009Bill and I were so blessed to call Pete a good friend.  We loved him as a member of our family.  His passing has left a void that only memories, photos and music can partially fill.  Our prayers are with his family.Bill and Mary HeldtDAD & JIMMYMarch 14, 2009DAD & PAPOUMarch 14, 2009March 14, 2009Pete was truly a pleasure to talk with, I enjoyed many a conversations some of which I will always remember.I recall how especially overjoyed and secure he felt in God's eternal promise (John 3:16, 14:6) since he gave his heart and life over to the only who can provide his place in heaven..Jesus Christ. Pete said " I wish I knew this 30-40 years ago". To Pete's family, my prayers are with/for all of you in this difficult time and may God grant you the peace only he can provide. I know in my heart Pete accepted God,s gift of eternal life, and though I miss him now I'll see him again with better days ahead.Pat GiacobbeCarmelita ArnoldMarch 14, 2009To the family of Peter Mestousis, my deepest sympathy for your loss.
