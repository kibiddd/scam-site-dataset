Owen Hart was set to make an entrance from the ceiling, and he fell from the ceiling. And I have the unfortunate responsibility to let everyone know that Owen Hart has died. Owen Hart has tragically died from that accident here tonight.ConnectionsFeatured in WWE Monday Night RAW: Who is the Greater Power? (1999)User reviews13ReviewFeatured reviewThe show must go on???The fact the entire card of that PPV took place that night makes me really feel bad about being a wrestling fan. The WWE stated in a press conference following the event that the reason they went on after Owen's fall is that this is what Owen would have wanted. Sure Owen would have wanted wrestling to go on but not right away. Excuse me but that is by far the WORST decision Vince Mcmahon ever tooked. Im so disgusted with the fact that they were only able to give 15mins, they annouced his death live and spend the following night at Raw all crying out loud on network television paying him a so-called Steve Austin drinking beer celebration. No matter what kind of entertainment you are offering even though you are live in front of the entire country, sometimes the show must be stopped.sickthings81May 11, 2003PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateMay 23, 1999 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishFilming locationsKansas City, Missouri, USASee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime2 hours 22 minutesRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page
