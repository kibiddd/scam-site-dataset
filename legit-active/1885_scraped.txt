LES GRANDS BALLETS CANADIENS PERFORMSGREAT CLASSICS OF THE 20TH CENTURY The renowned MontrÃ©al-based Les Grands Ballets Canadiens will kick off its U.S. tour series, Great Classics of the 20th Century, with a performance at the Luckman Fine Arts Complex on the campus of California State University, Los Angeles, on Saturday, March 25.In tribute to a century barely over, the company will present George Balanchine's Valse fantaisie, Antony Tudor's Jardin aux lilas, JosÃ© Limon's The Moor's Pavane and Kurt Jooss' The Green Table, thus giving audiences a chance to experience several astonishingly modern works.Valse Fantaisie was originally the second part of Glinkaiana, a ballet in four movements created in 1967 by the New York City Ballet to music by the Russian composer MikhaÃ¯l Glinka. Balanchine then used Glinka's music, Valse Fantaisie in B minor, to create a unique ballet in 1969. The choreography requires from its performers velocity, virtuosity and brio.Antony Tudor, British dancer, choreographer and teacher born in London in 1909, created an extensive repertoire of works based on social and psychological themes. In 1936, Ballet Rambert premiered Tudor's Jardin aux lilas (Lilac Garden), a tragedy of manners set to Ernest Chausson's romantic PoÃ¨me, opus 25, for violin and orchestra. This passionate story of love thwarted when two people are forced to enter into a marriage of convenience was staged for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1981 by Sallie Wilson.The Moor's Pavane, subtitled Variations on the theme of Othello, was first performed in 1949 by the JosÃ© LimÃ³n Dance Company. Rather than a retelling of Shakespeare's play, the work reinterprets the legend of the hapless Moor and his wrongly suspected wife in the form of a pavane and other dances of the High Renaissance. Music is by Henry Purcell.An avant-garde masterpiece, Kurt Jooss' The Green Table won first prize at the International Competition of Choreography in Paris in 1932. Warned that he was to be taken into "protective custody" by the Nazis for refusing to dismiss the Jewish members of his company, Jooss and his company secretly fled Germany and relocated to England. Ballet Jooss toured worldwide with great success, and Jooss did not return to his native country until 1949. His seminal work, The Green Table was described by John J. O'Connor of the New York Times as "very likely the most powerful antiwar statement ever devised for dance." In Jooss' own words from 1932, the ballet is "a choreographic figuration on the occurrence of war. Starting from the Dances of Death of the past centuries, it is a surrealistic performance of the destructive power of war."Gradimir Pankov, who succeeded Lawrence Rhodes as artistic director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in January, excelled as a dancer in the former Yugoslavia and Germany. Pankov was guest teacher for the prestigious ballet companies Le ballet de l'OpÃ©ra de Paris, the Nederlands Dans Theater and the American Ballet Theatre, and served as Artistic Director of four major international ballet companies since 1980: the Nederlands Dans Theater II, the National Ballet of Finland, the Culberg Ballet and the Ballet du Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre de GenÃ¨ve."[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens] is known for the rich interpretive qualities of its dancers and the uniqueness of its repertoire," Pankov stated after nomination last fall to his position as the company's artistic director. "Passion, heart and originality are values which are important to me. These values will carry us across the new millennium and will be adapted to meet the needs of today's public."Founded in 1957 by Ludmilla Chiriaeff, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens has toured France, Brazil, England, Scotland, Luxembourg, Spain and the U.S. The 1999-2000 season marks the company's twelfth visit south of the Canadian border since 1990. After Los Angeles, the tour will proceed to Houston, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. Sponsors are the Societe gÃ©nÃ©rale de financement du QuÃ©bec, and Donohue, with additional backing provided by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. In May, the company will present the Great Europeans program at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, South Carolina. WHAT:Great Classics of the 20th Century series, Les Grands Ballets CanadiensWHERE:Harriet & Charles Luckman Fine Arts Complex at Cal State L.A.5151 State University Drive, Los Angeles (intersection of the 10 and 710 freeways)WHEN:Saturday, March 25, 2000 at 8:00 p.m.TICKETS:$40/35.
