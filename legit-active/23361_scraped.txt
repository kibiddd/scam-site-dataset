Jets expected to bring back LaDainian Tomlinson for 2011 season; John Conner slated to be starting fullback

The future Hall of Fame running back was the team’s leading rusher in his first season with Gang Green. He was also the unquestioned inspirational leader.Tomlinson, 31, started off the 2010 season on fire. He eventually split carries with Greene, but remained a valuable pass catching option for Mark Sanchez throughout the season.When I caught up to Tomlinson in Dallas during Super Bowl week, he left little doubt that he wanted to return to the Jets as long as his role was clearly defined. He also made it clear that he was amenable to not being a starter. He’ll likely play more of a complementary role to Shonn Greene this time around.Tomlinson is scheduled to earn $2.4 million in the final year of his two-year deal. The Jets don’t have much money tied up in the running back position. Greene is slated to earn $480,000 in base salary, while McKnight has a $405,000 base salary for 2011.“That’s something that really needs to be decided,” Tomlinson told me last month about the team outlining his specific duties. “I don’t want to be there and just be this guy that’s just on the bench. I think that reduction would have to be defined. I always want them to be up front with me. I think I deserve that much.”“Usually teams already have their minds made up of how they want things to go,” Tomlinson added. “So, for me, I just want to do the best that I can and not really say that I want to be the starter. Because that’s not what it’s about for me. I’m just going to be the best that I can be. Whatever role that might be.”Tomlinson firmly believes the Jets can thrive with a three-headed rushing attack that also includes Greene and Joe McKnight.“We absolutely can make it work,” Tomlinson said. “I think it would work great, to be honest with you. Because all of us bring something a little bit different.”
The Daily News has also learned that second-year pro John Conner will be slated to be the starting fullback in 2011. Veteran fullback Tony Richardson is an unrestricted free agent.(Photo by Antonelli/News)For more Jets news, follow Manish Mehta on Twitter at http://twitter.com/TheJetsStream
