MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER GAME SUMMARY
MARCH 23, 2002 - METROSTARS 3, NEW ENGLAND REVOLUTION 1
EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey - Offseason acquisition Diego Serna registered
two assists, while Clint Mathis and Rodrigo Faria each scored once, as the
MetroStars defeated the New England Revolution 3-1 at Giants Stadium on Saturday
night. The match was the season opener for both teams during Major League
Soccer's seventh campaign.
Serna was one of 10 players to make his debut with a new club in tonight's
match, after playing last season for the Miami Fusion. He faced a Revolution
squad comprised of former Fusion teammates Carlos Llamosa, Jim Rooney and
Alex Pineda Chacon.
The first quality chance of the game came from Faria, who penetrated the
left side of New England's penalty area in the 22nd minute. Faria's short
cross found streaking teammate Petter Villegas, but the midfielder's shot
sizzled wide left.
Faria nearly struck again in the 33rd minute when an errant clearing header
by Revolution midfielder Jay Heaps floated high to him in the center of the
penalty area. With time to balance himself as the ball came down, Faria unleashed
a spectacular side volley that was knocked wide right by Revolution goalkeeper
Juergen Sommer.
The Revolution quickly attempted to counter as reigning MLS Budweiser Scoring
Champion Pineda Chacon slightly tested MetroStars goalkeeper Tim Howard with
a long shot seconds later. Still on the prowl two minutes later, Pineda Chacon
sent a glancing header wide by inches.
Pineda Chacon wasted little time moving back into the attack as the second
half begun. Taking a feed from teammate Andy Williams into the penalty area,
the Revolution's Honduran legend danced past MetroStars defender Steve Jolley
and rolled his first goal of the season past a sprawling Howard in the 50th
minute.
\Faria quickly answered however, as Serna split the Revolution defense with
a pass up the middle of the field. In a foot race with New England defender
Leo Cullen, Faria inched past his pursuer to claim the ball and poked it
past the charging Sommer to tie the match at 1-1.
Both teams traded quality chances after the match reached the hour mark as
a Daniel Hernandez freekick struck the crossbar in the 63rd minute and a
Mamadou Diallo header forced a Howard save in the 66th minute.
Still pushing for the equalizer, the MetroStars surged ahead 2-1 following
a Revolution own goal in the 72nd minute. After slicing through the Revolution
defense from midfield, Serna reached the top of the penalty area before sliding
a short pass to Faria on his right side. Faria then sent a first time crossing
attempt though the box only to see Llamosa's lunging header deflect past
the helpless Sommer into the net.
Now sensing the Revolution's vulnerability, the MetroStars seized their final
goal of the evening when Mathis nodded home a cross from Serna in the 77th
minute.
The victory marked the MetroStars second straight season opening win against
the Revolution at Giants Stadium. Octavio Zambrano's squad secured a 2-1
win versus New England in last season's campaign opener on April 7, 2001.
On Wednesday, March 27, the MetroStars (1-0-0, 3pts) will return to action
at Giants Stadium as the host the Columbus Crew at 7:00 p.m. (ET). The match
will be followed by an international exhibition between the national teams
of Ecuador and Bulgaria. New England (0-1-0, 0pts) remains idle this coming
week, next traveling to meet the defending MLS Cup Champion San Jose Earthquakes
on Saturday April 6 at 3:00 p.m. (ET).
