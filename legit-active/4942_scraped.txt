List of states and territories of the United States
The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (where the nation's seat of government–Washington, D.C.–is located), five major territories, and various possessions. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America (also bordering Canada) and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.
States are the primary subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as regulating intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state.Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.

United States nationality law
Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the United States Constitution expressly gives the United States Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 sets forth the legal requirements for the acquisition of, and divestiture from, American nationality. The requirements have become more explicit since the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, with the most recent changes to statutory law having been made by the United States Congress in 2001.
Rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens
Rights of citizens
Adult citizens of the United States who are residents of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) have the right to participate in the political system of the United States, as well as their state and local governments (with most states having restrictions on voting by persons convicted of felonies, and a federal constitutional prohibition on naturalized persons running for President and Vice President of the United States), to be represented and protected abroad by the United States (through U.S. embassies and consulates), and to live in the United States and certain territories without any immigration requirements.
Felons can vote in over 40 states, and in at least 2 while incarcerated. Felons can also serve jury duty if approved.

Basketball
Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end.
A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one point, after the other team was assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) is issued when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by throwing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.

SS United States
SS United States is a luxury passenger liner built in 1952 for United States Lines designed to capture the trans-Atlantic speed record.
Built at a cost of $79.4 million ($724 million in today's dollars) the ship is the largest ocean liner constructed entirely in the U.S. and the fastest ocean liner to  cross the Atlantic in either direction. Even in her retirement, she retains the Blue Riband, the accolade given to the passenger liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean in regular service with the highest speed.
Her construction was subsidized by the U.S. government, since she was designed to allow conversion to a troopship should the need arise.United States operated uninterrupted in transatlantic passenger service until 1969. Since 1996 she has been docked at Pier 82 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.
Design and construction
Inspired by the exemplary service of the British liners RMS Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, which transported hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to Europe during World War II, the U.S. government sponsored the construction of a large and fast merchant vessel that would be capable of transporting large numbers of soldiers. Designed by renowned American naval architect and marine engineer William Francis Gibbs (1886–1967), the liner's construction was a joint effort between the United States Navy and United States Lines. The U.S. government underwrote $50 million of the $78 million construction cost, with the ship's operators, United States Lines, contributing the remaining $28 million. In exchange, the ship was designed to be easily converted in times of war to a troopship with a capacity of 15,000 troops, or to a hospital ship .

How Big is America, Really?
People often talk about how massive the United States is in terms of economy and land, but here's a fact that really puts it into perspective: The state of Texas alone has a GDP roughly equal to the entire African continent-minus South Africa.
Yes, you read that right. One U.S. state generates as much economic output as over 50 countries combined.
Texas, a single state, with just 30 million people, produces the same wealth as a continent of over a billion people. That's the scale of the economic disparity.
And we're not even talking about the entire U.S. economy-just one state, known for oil, tech, energy, and industry, standing toe-to-toe with an entire landmass that spans three times the size of the U.S.

Weston McKennie tried his luck for the USMNT with a header in the area in the 20’ that was denied by Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera.
The second half saw an intention to attack from both teams, each searching for a chance to change the game.
Panama eventually found the match-winner in the 90’+4, Adalberto Carrasquilla getting the ball from the United States defensive line before sending it to the edge of the area where Cecilio Waterman sent a right-footed shot to the left side netting.
The U.S. tried to even things out in the final seconds, with Tyler Adams getting the last look towards goal in the 90’+8, but his shot was wide.
The Stars and Stripes will meet the loser of the Canada-Mexico semifinal in the third-place match on Sunday.

People often talk about how massive the United States is in terms of economy and land, but here's a fact that really puts it into perspective: The state of Texas alone has a GDP roughly equal to the entire African continent-minus South Africa.
Yes, you read that right. One U.S. state generates as much economic output as over 50 countries combined.
Texas, a single state, with just 30 million people, produces the same wealth as a continent of over a billion people. That's the scale of the economic disparity.
And we're not even talking about the entire U.S. economy-just one state, known for oil, tech, energy, and industry, standing toe-to-toe with an entire landmass that spans three times the size of the U.S.

Disambiguation
Welcome to another edition of the VT Podcast which I’ve called Ideas That Matter.
In this episode, I talk about Disambiguation.
If you want to change the world, you have to see the world for what it is. We humans are pattern-seeking animals. We love stories. Our minds are hard-wired to organize the world using patterns, which saves our conscious minds a lot of mental effort. But it's also become a limitation for us - it's easy to get stuck in patterns that don't serve us well. If you're dispelling myths about yourself, or if you're trying to change your life, start by looking at the small things - the patterns that shape your life on a daily basis.
Listen in.

Disambiguation or Entity Linking is the assignment of a knowledge base identifier (Wikidata, Wikipedia) to a named entity. Our goal was to improve an MVP model by adding newly created knowledge while maintaining competitive F1 scores.
Taking an entity linking model from MVP into production in a spaCy-native pipeline architecture posed several data science and engineering challenges, such as hyperparameter estimation and knowledge enhancement, which we addressed by taking advantage of the engineering tools Docker and Kubernetes to semi-automate training as a...

SUPER ADVANCED US Navy DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class STEALTH Destroyer
US Navy The Zumwalt-class destroyers are a class of United States Navy destroyers designed as multi-mission ships with a focus on land attack. The class is a scaled-back project that emerged after funding cuts to the larger DD-21 vessel program. The program was previously known as the "DD(X)". The class is multi-role and designed for surface warfare, anti-aircraft, and naval fire support. They take the place of battleships in filling the former congressional mandate for naval fire support,[8] though the requirement was reduced to allow them to fill this role. The vessels' appearance has been compared to that of the historic ironclad warship.[9]
The class has a low radar profile; an integrated power system, which can send electricity to the electric drive motors or weapons, which may somed...

Welcome to another edition of the VT Podcast which I’ve called Ideas That Matter.
In this episode, I talk about Disambiguation.
If you want to change the world, you have to see the world for what it is. We humans are pattern-seeking animals. We love stories. Our minds are hard-wired to organize the world using patterns, which saves our conscious minds a lot of mental effort. But it's also become a limitation for us - it's easy to get stuck in patterns that don't serve us well. If you're dispelling myths about yourself, or if you're trying to change your life, start by looking at the small things - the patterns that shape your life on a daily basis.

Disambiguation or Entity Linking is the assignment of a knowledge base identifier (Wikidata, Wikipedia) to a named entity. Our goal was to improve an MVP model by adding newly created knowledge while maintaining competitive F1 scores.
Taking an entity linking model from MVP into production in a spaCy-native pipeline architecture posed several data science and engineering challenges, such as hyperparameter estimation and knowledge enhancement, which we addressed by taking advantage of the engineering tools Docker and Kubernetes to semi-automate training as an on-demand job.
We also discuss some of our learnings and process improvements that were needed to strike a balance between data science goals and engineering constraints and present our current work on improving performance through BERT-embedding based contextual similarity.

The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a transcontinental country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine minor outlying islands,[i] and 326 Indian reservations with limited sovereignty. It is the third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] The United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and with Mexico to the south as well as maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia, among others.[j] It has a population of over 331 million,[d] and is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city and financial center is New York City. The United States is a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, and its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. It has a highly diverse climate and geography and is officially recognized as one of the 17 ecologically megadiverse countries.

SUPER ADVANCED US Navy DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class STEALTH Destroyer

US Navy The Zumwalt-class destroyers are a class of United States Navy destroyers designed as multi-mission ships with a focus on land attack. The class is a scaled-back project that emerged after funding cuts to the larger DD-21 vessel program. The program was previously known as the "DD(X)". The class is multi-role and designed for surface warfare, anti-aircraft, and naval fire support. They take the place of battleships in filling the former congressional mandate for naval fire support,[8] though the requirement was reduced to allow them to fill this role. The vessels' appearance has been compared to that of the historic ironclad warship.[9]
The class has a low radar profile; an integrated power system, which can send electricity to the electric drive motors or weapons, which may someday include a railgun[10] or free-electron lasers;[11] total ship computing environment infrastructure, serving as the ship's primary LAN and as the hardware-independent platform for all of the ship's software ensembles; automated fire-fighting systems and automated piping rupture isolation. The class is designed to require a smaller crew and be less expensive to operate than comparable warships. It will have a wave-piercing tumblehome hull form whose sides slope inward above the waterline. This will reduce the radar cross-section, returning much less energy than a more hard-angled hull form. As of January 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that only four out of 12 of the critical technologies were mature.[12]
The lead ship will be named Zumwalt for Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, and carries the hull number DDG-1000. Originally 32 ships were planned, with the $9.6 billion research and development costs spread across the class, but as the quantity was reduced to 10, then 3, the cost-per-ship increased dramatically.[13][14] The cost increase caused the U.S. Navy to identify the program as being in breach of the Nunn--McCurdy Amendment on 1 February 2010.[15][16]
Stealth[edit]
Despite being 40% larger than an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer the radar signature is more akin to a fishing boat and sound levels are compared to the Los Angeles-class submarines. The tumblehome hull reduces radar return and the composite material deckhouse also has a low radar return. Water sleeting along the sides, along with passive cool air induction in the mack reduces thermal emissions.[42]
The U.S. Navy solicited bids for a lower cost steel deckhouse as an option for DDG-1002, the last Zumwalt destroyer in January 2013.[43][44][45] On 2 August 2013, the US Navy announced it was awarding a $212 million contract to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works to build a steel deckhouse for destroyer Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002).[45]
The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. It is larger than the next 13 largest navies combined in terms of battle fleet tonnage, according to one estimate.[5][6] The U.S. Navy also has the world's largest carrier fleet, with 10 in service, one under construction (two planned), and two in reserve. The service has 317,054 personnel on active duty and 109,671 in the Navy Reserve. It operates 283 ships in active service and more than 3,700 aircraft.[3]
The navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was essentially disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. It played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers. It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Japan.
The 21st century United States Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in such areas as East Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward areas during peacetime, and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it an active player in U.S. foreign and defense policy.
The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Secretary of Defense. The Chief of Naval Operations is a four-star admiral and the senior naval officer of the Department of the Navy.[7] However, the CNO may not be the highest ranking naval officer in the armed forces if the Chairman or the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are Navy officers, who by law, outrank the CNO.

United States 🆚 Panama
Game Highlights 📹
#CNLFinals #unitedstates #panama #concacaf #nationsleague
Panama earned a 1-nil win against the United States to determine the first finalist of the 2025 Concacaf Nations League Finals on Thursday at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, USA.
Los Canaleros became the first Central American squad to advance to the championship match, which they will play on Sunday against the Canada-Mexico winner. The result also ended a reign of three consecutive CNL titles for the United States.
Josh Sargent tried his chances early on in an attempt to give the United States the opening goal with a right-footed shot in the 19’, but his shot was blocked by Edgardo Fariña.
Weston McKennie tried his luck for the USMNT with a header in the area in the 20’ that was denied by Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera.
The second half saw an intention to attack from both teams, each searching for a chance to change the game.
Panama eventually found the match-winner in the 90’+4, Adalberto Carrasquilla getting the ball from the United States defensive line before sending it to the edge of the area where Cecilio Waterman sent a right-footed shot to the left side netting.
The U.S. tried to even things out in the final seconds, with Tyler Adams getting the last look towards goal in the 90’+8, but his shot was wide.
The Stars and Stripes will meet the loser of the Canada-Mexico semifinal in the third-place match on Sunday.

You can learn more about Conservancy and donate to help a save America’s Flagship by going to www.SSUSC.org.
The SS United States - America’s flagship. The fastest and safest ocean liner in history and a classified military service ship in the event of war. Winner of the Blue Riband and one of the last remaining classic ocean liners left in the world.
She sits, quiet and dormant, at Pier 82 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a reminder of the triumph of the trans-Atlantic passenger service, and waiting in hope for an eventual second life. Whatever may come of her, this ship has stories to tell us.
Thanks to the wonderful assistance of the SS United States Conservancy, my friends and I have been given access to the ship to come aboard, explore her history, uncovering it as we go below decks, and find parts of the ship never before seen online. We’ll take a step back into the 1950’s and 60’s, with this magnificent ship serving as our window to the past.
A special thank you to @dumpsterfireproductions for their assistance with our Unreal 5 assets!

People often talk about how massive the United States is in terms of economy and land, but here's a fact that really puts it into perspective: The state of Texas alone has a GDP roughly equal to the entire African continent-minus South Africa.
Yes, you read that right. One U.S. state generates as much economic output as over 50 countries combined.
Texas, a single state, with just 30 million people, produces the same wealth as a continent of over a billion people. That's the scale of the economic disparity.
And we're not even talking about the entire U.S. economy-just one state, known for oil, tech, energy, and industry, standing toe-to-toe with an entire landmass that spans three times the size of the U.S.

In the year 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered The Americas.
Millions died in pursuit of conquering this unknown land.
The European powers of the time took part in colonization, and the centuries after witnessed remarkable wars and a new age of influence.
These events led to the birth of a new nation on July 4th, 1776.
The United States of America.
Since, the USA has conquered the world in every aspect possible.
From developing the most powerful military in modern history, to countless astonishing human accomplishments, the country has earned the name ‘The Modern Roman Empire’.
But can this Giant continue its dominance?
To understand the story of this fascinating land, we must start from the very beginning…

Coordinates: 40°N 100°W﻿ / ﻿40°N 100°W﻿ / 40; -100
The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.

Ranking EVERY State and Territory in the United States of America from WORST to BEST!
We Ranked All 50 States & 5 Territories to live in the USA so you know where to move to and live!  Find out which states or territories have the best cities & small towns to live in for 2024!
➽ Join our OFFICIAL Discord Server!: https://discord.gg/r2aYWeaXeq
The United States of America is a very LARGE and DIVERSE country, with hundreds of different types of cultures, cities, and natural scenery. So in order to determine which states and territories are the best (and worst), we analyze a few categories including their economy, climate, cost of living, crime and safety, education, health, and quality of life. I also implemented the pros and cons of each location and my personal experiences as I have lived in 10 and visited 52 of the 55 states and territories on this list!
Whether you want empty space to homestead and buy cheap land, OR live in a big walkable city with plenty of amenities, the US has it all! So my biggest suggestion is to visit these cities, towns, and state before you decide where you want to move to and live.

Welcome to another edition of the VT Podcast which I’ve called Ideas That Matter.
In this episode, I talk about Disambiguation.
If you want to change the world, you have to see the world for what it is. We humans are pattern-seeking animals. We love stories. Our minds are hard-wired to organize the world using patterns, which saves our conscious minds a lot of mental effort. But it's also become a limitation for us - it's easy to get stuck in patterns that don't serve us well. If you're dispelling myths about yourself, or if you're trying to change your life, start by looking at the small things - the patterns that shape your life on a daily basis.

Disambiguation or Entity Linking is the assignment of a knowledge base identifier (Wikidata, Wikipedia) to a named entity. Our goal was to improve an MVP model by adding newly created knowledge while maintaining competitive F1 scores.
Taking an entity linking model from MVP into production in a spaCy-native pipeline architecture posed several data science and engineering challenges, such as hyperparameter estimation and knowledge enhancement, which we addressed by taking advantage of the engineering tools Docker and Kubernetes to semi-automate training as an on-demand job.
We also discuss some of our learnings and process improvements that were needed to strike a balance between data science goals and engineering constraints and present our current work on improving performance through BERT-embedding based contextual similarity.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine minor outlying islands,[i] and 326 Indian reservations with limited sovereignty. It is the third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] The United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and with Mexico to the south as well as maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia, among others.[j] It has a population of over 331 million,[d] and is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city and financial center is New York City. The United States is a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, and its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. It has a highly diverse climate and geography and is officially recognized as one of the 17 ecologically megadiverse countries.

US Navy The Zumwalt-class destroyers are a class of United States Navy destroyers designed as multi-mission ships with a focus on land attack. The class is a scaled-back project that emerged after funding cuts to the larger DD-21 vessel program. The program was previously known as the "DD(X)". The class is multi-role and designed for surface warfare, anti-aircraft, and naval fire support. They take the place of battleships in filling the former congressional mandate for naval fire support,[8] though the requirement was reduced to allow them to fill this role. The vessels' appearance has been compared to that of the historic ironclad warship.[9]
The class has a low radar profile; an integrated power system, which can send electricity to the electric drive motors or weapons, which may someday include a railgun[10] or free-electron lasers;[11] total ship computing environment infrastructure, serving as the ship's primary LAN and as the hardware-independent platform for all of the ship's software ensembles; automated fire-fighting systems and automated piping rupture isolation. The class is designed to require a smaller crew and be less expensive to operate than comparable warships. It will have a wave-piercing tumblehome hull form whose sides slope inward above the waterline. This will reduce the radar cross-section, returning much less energy than a more hard-angled hull form. As of January 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that only four out of 12 of the critical technologies were mature.[12]
The lead ship will be named Zumwalt for Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, and carries the hull number DDG-1000. Originally 32 ships were planned, with the $9.6 billion research and development costs spread across the class, but as the quantity was reduced to 10, then 3, the cost-per-ship increased dramatically.[13][14] The cost increase caused the U.S. Navy to identify the program as being in breach of the Nunn--McCurdy Amendment on 1 February 2010.[15][16]
Stealth[edit]
Despite being 40% larger than an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer the radar signature is more akin to a fishing boat and sound levels are compared to the Los Angeles-class submarines. The tumblehome hull reduces radar return and the composite material deckhouse also has a low radar return. Water sleeting along the sides, along with passive cool air induction in the mack reduces thermal emissions.[42]
The U.S. Navy solicited bids for a lower cost steel deckhouse as an option for DDG-1002, the last Zumwalt destroyer in January 2013.[43][44][45] On 2 August 2013, the US Navy announced it was awarding a $212 million contract to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works to build a steel deckhouse for destroyer Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002).[45]
The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. It is larger than the next 13 largest navies combined in terms of battle fleet tonnage, according to one estimate.[5][6] The U.S. Navy also has the world's largest carrier fleet, with 10 in service, one under construction (two planned), and two in reserve. The service has 317,054 personnel on active duty and 109,671 in the Navy Reserve. It operates 283 ships in active service and more than 3,700 aircraft.[3]
The navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was essentially disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. It played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers. It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Japan.
The 21st century United States Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in such areas as East Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward areas during peacetime, and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it an active player in U.S. foreign and defense policy.
The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Secretary of Defense. The Chief of Naval Operations is a four-star admiral and the senior naval officer of the Department of the Navy.[7] However, the CNO may not be the highest ranking naval officer in the armed forces if the Chairman or the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are Navy officers, who by law, outrank the CNO.
