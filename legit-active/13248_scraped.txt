Founded in 2004, the John Perkins Center is a first-of-its-kind partnership between the John and Vera Mae Perkins Foundation of Jackson, Mississippi and Seattle Pacific University. As a center that seeks to live into the legacy of reconciliation and community development from Dr. John Perkins, he has described it as “the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.”
Scholarship
The Perkins Center’s academic partnerships include the Urban Studies minor, Global and Urban Ministry minor, and the annual Perkins Center Prize.
Student involvement
Students learn and practice principles of community development through their experiences with community engagement and transformative partnerships.
