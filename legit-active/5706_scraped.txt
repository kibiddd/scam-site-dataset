DukeKyle Singler is returning. Duke will finally have a true point guard running the show in Mr. Irving. Transfer Seth Curry and the return of SG Nolan Smith makes this Duke team number one.2.

Kansas StateYes, Dennis Clemente is gone, but Jacob Pullen and his three-headed monster front-court of Samuels, Kelly, and Sutton make the Wildcats the deepest team in the country.4. Michigan StateOnly losing Raymar Morgan, who in my opinion under-produced. The Spartans will be back in the Final Four discussion with star Kalin Lucas back at the point and key role players Korie Lucious and Draymond Green.5. WashingtonIsaiah Thomas at PG, Abdul Gaddy at SG, Terrence Ross at SF, and Terrence Jones at PF..can't argue against that.6. BaylorEkpe Udoh and Tweety Carter leave but many believe incoming Freshman big man Perry Jones could be the best big man in the country. He, together with returning starters Lacedarius Dunn and Quincy Acy will be tough to take down.¬†7. FloridaFrankly, Florida could even be higher. Their back-court is as solid as any other in the country with Kenny Boynton and Erving Walker. They have Alex Tyus coming back after spurning the draft. They have Chandler Parsons and his late game heroics. Not to mention an incoming freshman by the name of Patric Young who may be stronger than any other incoming Freshman.¬†8. Ohio StateThis team lost a lot from Turner's departure but they are hoping that the arrival of star Freshman Jared Sullinger will equalize what they've lost. Sullinger is mainly a low-post threat, but OSU can afford Turners departure with their returning guards. David Lighty, William Buford, and Jon Diebler.9. VillanovaScottie Reynolds is gone, but honestly who cares? Reynolds was invisible in the NCAA tournament and his leadership lacked for much of the season. Sophomore Maalik Wayns should fill in for Reynolds and the Wildcats have the rest of their core returning in Corey Fisher, Corey Stokes, Antonio Pena, and Sophomore-sure to be stars Taylor King and Mouphtaou Yarou.10. KentuckyWhen you're starting five leaves, just simply reload. Kentucky will sport an entirely new starting lineup next year, once again consisting of mainly Freshman.Brandon Knight replaces John Wall at PG. Deandre Liggins steps in at the 2. Doron Lamb replaces Eric Bledsoe as the third guard. Dairus Miller starts at forward and Enes Kanter will start at center. ¬†11. North CarolinaTwo Words: Harrison Barnes12. PittsburghThe Pittsburgh Panthers who exceeded expectations all of last season, return almost all of their players. The matured core will continue to flourish under head coach Jamie Dixon. Sophomore Dante Taylor could blossom into the big time recruit we was sought out to be. Ashton Gibbs will continue to lead the team in scoring.¬†13. TennesseeWith Chism and Prince gone, Tennessee will lose two of their top three scorers from last year. No problem. Incoming Freshman Tobias Harris looks to be the answer, while Scotty Hopson will help out with the scoring. Look for sophomore Kenny Hall to step up his game.¬†14. GonzagaElias Harris will be the new face of the Zags. His near triple-double performances will put opposing teams into defensive meltdowns nightly.¬†15. GeorgetownI don't see how the Hoyas won't be relevant this upcoming season, being that they return two future guards in Freeman and Wright. Throw in Julian Vaughn down low and emerging Sophomore Hollis Thompson and you got a Big East contender once again.¬†16. IllinoisI hate this team, but they're going to be good. Mccamey returns at PG. His fellow guards Mike Davis and Brandon Paul return too. Incoming Freshman Jereme Richmond should help their front-court problems (Mike Tisdale was a bum last year.)17. GeorgiaSleeper. Sleeper. SleeperTravis Leslie is college basketball's most exciting and talented player. Look him up on Youtube if you don't believe me. Oh, also Trey Thompkins, their leading scorer from last year has decided to come back for another season. Should be a fun one in Athens.¬†18. Syracuse'Cuse lost a lot with the departures of Wesley Johnson, Andy Rautins, and Onuaku. However, they do have an emerging star in Kris Joseph and the backcourt duo of Brandon Triche and Scoop Jardine. Their recruiting class should fill in the holes pretty nicely with C Fab Melo and G Dion Waiters.¬†19. Kansas2009-10 favorites minus Aldrich, Collins, and Xavier Henry plus Josh Selby = a top 25 team.¬†The Morris Brothers will be beastly in the paint and Selby will put the team on his shoulders. Tyshawn Taylor will finally get the opportunity he's wanted. This team could be dangerous.¬†20. Virginia TechMalcom Delaney is back, and I, like many other college basketball fans besides V Tech fans, know nothing else about Virginia Tech. So, yeah take the top twenty ranking, but this time don't miss the NCAA tournament.¬†21. San Diego StateKawhi Leonard is nasty. D.J Gay is lethal from behind the arc. I like this team. They should win the MWC.22.TexasThey could be a mystery again this upcoming year. So much talent, but will it all click?¬†Incoming top-10 Freshman Tristan Thompson should fill in for Pittman, but they need Brown or Balbay to step up. Jordan Hamilton will get increased playing time and could turn out to be a star.¬†23. MissouriKim English is a leader. This team is too good at home and too good defensively to ever doubt. They also have a nice recruiting class24. MemphisStar: Will Barton25. North Carolina StateStar: C.J Leslie26. ButlerStar: Shelvin Mack27. TempleStar: Lavoy Allen28. UCLAStar:¬†29.
