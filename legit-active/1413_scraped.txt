BiographyAwardsTriviaFAQIMDbProAll topicsNoah Beery(1882-1946)ActorSoundtrackIMDbProStarmeterSee rankRespected character actor of the silent and early sound period,
specializing in cruel villains. The son of Kansas City policeman Noah
Webster Beery and Frances Margaret Fitzgerald Beery, Noah Nicholas
Beery and his younger brother Wallace Beery both left home in their teens,
each seeking a career as a performer. Noah made his stage debut at the
age of 16 and worked steadily in the theatre until his early 30s.
Following his brother into films, he quickly established himself as a
competent player and a familiar heavy in all sorts of films,
particularly westerns. He never achieved the great fame of his younger
brother, but succeeded in carving a memorable niche for himself in the
history of film. His son Noah Beery Jr. became equally familiar as a character
actor, though usually in more genial roles.BornJanuary 17, 1882DiedApril 1, 1946(64)BornJanuary 17, 1882DiedApril 1, 1946(64)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
