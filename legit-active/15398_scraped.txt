Norman Kingsley Mailer was born on January 31,                                    1923, in Long Branch, New                                     Jersey. When Mailer was four, his family moved                                    to Brooklyn, New                                     York, and began attending Harvard University in 1939,                                    where he studied aeronautical engineering. At the university, he became                                    interested in writing and published his first story when he was 18,                                    and is a former member of the Harvard Advocate.  In 1944, Mailer was drafted into the Army during World                                   War II and served in the South Pacific. In 1948, just before enrolling                                    in the Sorbonne in Paris, he wrote a book that made him world-famous: The Naked and the Dead, based on his personal experiences during                                    the war. It was named one of the “100 best novels” by the                                    Modern Library. In the following years,                                   Mailer continued to work in  the field of                                   the novel. In the mid-1950s, he became increasingly                                   known  for his countercultural essays, and                                   he was one of the founders of The                                      Village Voice in 1955. In 1957, Mailer                                   published his now infamous essay on hipsterism,                                   “The White Negro.” As well as his fiction and non-fiction novels, Mailer                                    has produced a play version of The Deer Park, and in the late                                    sixties directed several films, including Maidstone (1970). In                                    1987, he directed a film version of his novel Tough Guys Don’t                                      Dance.  A number of Mailer’s works, such as The Armies                                    of the Night, are political. He covered the Republican and Democratic                                    National Conventions in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1992, and 1996. In 1967,                                    he was arrested for his involvement in anti-Vietnam demonstrations.                                    Two years later, he ran unsuccessfully as an independent for Mayor of                                    New York City.  His biographical subjects have included Pablo Picasso                                    and Lee Harvey Oswald. His 1986 off Broadway play Strawhead,                                    about Marilyn Monroe.  On the morning of November 10, 2007, Mailer died of acute renal failure, one month after undergoing lung surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, New York.
