He changed his mind upon meeting her, deciding her tomboyish attitude would be perfect for the part. Or, as she tells it on The Graham Norton Show (2007): "He initially thought I was too pretty, but then he met me and said 'Oh, no you're fine!'."GoofsDuring the ballroom scene, when Lizzy and Charlotte bump into Mr Darcy and he asks Lizzie to dance with him, if you turn the volume up you can hear the crew members discussing the position of the boom in the background.QuotesMr. Darcy: You must know... surely, you must know it was all for you. You are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I'd scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes have not changed, but one word from you will silence me forever. If, however, your feelings have changed, I will have to tell you: you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love--I love--I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.Crazy creditsThanks to ... The Dromgoole family ... all at Sands Films ... Andrew and

And it is so poorly filmed (visually) and so utterly about recreating the text (the Austen original), it ends up being awkward and sort of awful. As a movie.I know that is sacriledge to some. But I switched after an hour to this one, which I had seen before. And in two minutes I was sucked in. I think the biggest first point is this: to be true to Austen, you must find a way to put us there, to make us feel it. It's not about the text, the facts, the truth of the translation to film. It's about the effect and the final "truth" that this movie manages in a short two hours.So, yes, this is a filmic film. It's gorgeous and thoughtful for how it handles the scenes and the light, the movement of camera and the capturing of space. It's a wonderful film on a physical level. (There are particular scenes, in the middle especially at a party, where the camera follows the action from character to character through several rooms for a glorious long take that just fills the sensation of being there beautifully.)You might say this is Keira Knightly's movie, since she is Elizabeth. And she's kind of great (I've always had a reservation about her sincerity on screen). The cast around her is terrific--even the somewhat troublesome casting of Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy. I know that Mr Darcy is meant to be unpleasant, but he comes off as somewhat wooden for too long here...as he does in Colin Firth's hands, too, in fact.But I warm to him by the end, so maybe it's perfect. And the other cast, including stars like Sutherland and Dench, is great.The director, Joe Wright, is basically unknown to me, though I see he did the more excessive Knightley vehicle, "Atonement." So the tendancy for dramatic ambiance is a given, not to mention Anna Karenina (also starring Knightley). It all works. It's a kind of dramatization that purists probably hate, but for me it makes an original take on a classic that has its own dignity and beauty.And I'll add that Knightly is just 18 for this filming, and shows amazing depth for a young actress.Recommended!secondtakeJul 18, 2020PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inEverything New on Netflix in MarchEverything New on Netflix in MarchNo need to waste time endlessly scrolling — here's the entire lineup of new movies and TV shows streaming on Netflix this month.See the listListFAQ24How long is Pride & Prejudice?Powered by AlexaHow old are Lizzy and Darcy?What is Darcy's first name?Is it true Emma Thompson worked on the script?DetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 16, 2005 (United Kingdom)Countries of originUnited KingdomFranceUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial FacebookLanguageEnglishAlso known asOrgueil et préjugésFilming locationsChatsworth House, Edensor, Derbyshire, England, UK(Pemberley exteriors/Pemberley's grand staircase/Pemberley's sculpture gallery)Production companiesUniversal PicturesStudioCanalWorking Title FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$28,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$38,591,603Opening weekend US & Canada$2,804,000Nov 13, 2005Gross worldwide$121,803,070See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime2 hours 9 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalSDDSAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of Pride & Prejudice (2005) in Canada?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
