The Designers: PearsonLloyd
Luke Pearson and Tom Lloyd founded their award-winning design studio in London in 1997. Both have Masters. Luke Pearson studied industrial design at Central Saint Martins College of Art and furniture design at the Royal College of Art in London. Tom Lloyd studied furniture design in Nottingham and industrial design at the Royal College of Art. Today they are both tutors at the Royal College of Art in London. They also regularly lecture at international conventions such as Design Indaba South Africa and London.
The studio covers such varied spheres as furniture, product, lightning design as well as transport and public design. The studio has an international reputation and collaborates with a broad range of clients. Recent projects include a new lighting system for Westminster in the City of London with Artemide, showering enclosures for Ideal-Standard, the multi-award-winning Upper Class Suite for Virgin Atlantic and most recently the completion of their two economy classes.
