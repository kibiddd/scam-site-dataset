He was born on November. 6, 1926, to John and Katie James in Herington, Kansas.
He served in the U.S. Navy and before he was discharged in the summer of 1946 he met our mother, Ruth Audrey Sunde (Kenneth, Minnesota) on a blind date. They began their lives together on November 26, 1948. After Harry graduated from College of Emporia in 1951, he started his first teaching job at Marion Junior High School. In June of 1960, they packed up the car with their five children and headed to Seattle where Harry started his life-long passion of teaching as a student counselor. When he retired, they built their dream house in Snohomish, Washington. They lived many happy years there, until his beloved Ruth was called to the Lord in March of 1993.
Harry moved to Yuma in July of 1994, to start a new life in a warmer climate. In the fall of 1998, the Lord blessed him with Mary Fahringer and soon thereafter they were married. It was wonderful to see him so happy again. Sadly, the following year, Mary became ill and passed away.
The next part of his journey took him to the high desert in Kingman Arizona. In the spring of 2004, he built a beautiful home surrounded by the mountains that he loved so much.
Harry is survived by his three children, Chuck James of Kingman, Arizona, Nancy (Chris) Huss of Seattle, Washington, and Debbie (Paul) Pechak of Canoga Park, California; two grandsons, Michael Greene and Jordan Ildstad.
Harry was preceded in death by two sons, Michael James and David James.
Our father was a kind, loving, honest, hard working and compassionate man. He had integrity and often was referred to as "the greatest guy I ever met." He was very devoted to the Lord, his family and friends. Harry was deeply loved and is terribly missed, these are two signs of a wonderful life.
