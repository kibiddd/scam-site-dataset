Por las Carreteras de Mexico | Mexico Road Atlas | Guia Roji
An essential tool when traveling in Mexico
Guia Roji has just published the 2025 Mexico Road Atlas. The first new edition in 10 years! Every new edition has had new, updated information and this is no exception. Even the route of the new Tren Maya are included on two pages.
Includes detailed mapping for Mexico and an index of over 13,000 places. As in previous editions Central Mexico is presented at 1:500,000. The atlas is "in Spanish" but, besides the pages of tourist information, it's just maps and maps are not translated. It's a “must have” tool for traveling in Mexico.
128 pages. 8 1/2 x 11 inches. Scale 1:1,000,000/1:500,00.
