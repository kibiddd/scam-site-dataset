Revolutionizing internet and sports marketing since 1999 through creative advertising and promotional programs.
iHigh.com was created in 1999 as a revolutionary national website network for high schools in partnership with the National Federation of High Schools (NFHS). This first-to-market idea led to a network of over 10,000 high school websites and 34 state association marketing sponsorships.
This groundbreaking approach transformed the landscape of high school sports as iHigh grew to a full-service marketing and promotional platform. Today iHigh offers clients an opportunity to connect with its network through advertising, marketing and promotional programs. These include in-school fitness events, the Great American Rivalry Series, Sports Clinics and client-specific custom events designed to reach the high school demographic.
Get in the GAME
The creation of the Great American Rivalry Series (GARS), a 20+ year marketing program.
iHigh Marketing Inc., created GARS to help brands gain awareness by getting associated with one of the largest fan bases in America. GARS allows brands to access untapped, younger audiences and connect with these customers on a more personal level. We also created repeatable and effective marketing programs around fitness with the Navy SEALS, the US Marines, and the US Army, which are still utilized today.
Our creative minds also created a broad range of marketing concepts involving insurance, auto, commercial products, and health-focused campaigns for the youth and young adult audience.
