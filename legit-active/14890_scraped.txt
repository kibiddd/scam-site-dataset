The 2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament is scheduled to take place in March 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It's going to be the first Big East tournament to include all 16 of the Big East Conference's teams. It will have its every singe game carried on national TV by ESPN and ESPN2. Prior to the 2009 Tournament, only the top 12 teams in the Big East Conference were eligible to compete, but this season 16 teams will compete for the title. The Big East Men's Basketball Tournament will not only determine the Big East Conference champion but also the winner of the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
The history of Big East dates back to 1979, when it was established as a basketball conference by seven charter schools. These schools were Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, Syracuse, Seton Hall, UConn, and Boston College. Later in 1982, Pittsburgh joined the Conference too. Its inaugural member teams were strategically picked from geographical areas though. The teams' success in basketball would bring the Big East commissioners huge rewarded. This led them to decide a team for the Big East to delve into other sports markets. However, it didn't take long for the Georgetown, one of the founding members of the Big East Conference, to make the NCAA Championship Game.
Just two years later in 1984, Georgetown returned home as the Big East's first NCAA basketball champions. The Big East Men's Basketball Tournament has since been held in Madison Square Garden, New York City. The following year saw three such Big East teams as Villanova, St. John's, and Georgetown advancing to the Final Four. The tournament ended with Villanova's stunning championship game victory. The 1985 Big East Men's Basketball Championship trophy was taken away by Indiana University. However, noteworthy is the fact that throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Georgetown, Syracuse, and St. John's were the primary powers in Big East Tournament.
Georgetown won five regular season Big East Conference championships and six Big East Tournaments. Syracuse won five regular season conference championships, three Big East Tournaments, and were invited to the NCAA Tournament every year. While, St. John's managed to reach to the 1985 Final Four, and made a post-season appearance in each of his 24 years at the helm. The Big East Men's Basketball was largely dominated by UConn during 90's to mid 00's. Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun's program won numerous Big East regular season and tournament championships. It also claimed the National Championship in both 1999 and 2004.
At the turn of the century, The Big East Men's Basketball Tournament turned challenges into opportunities to become stronger. 00's saw Big East enjoying tremendous basketball success than ever. In 2002-03 season Big East became the first conference in NCAA history to have won the men's and women's titles in the same year, while in 2006, the Conference got a record eight teams into the NCAA Men's Tournament. Proactive movement has been the signature for the conference which is going to being its 30th Big East Tournament in New York City. So, get on down to the Big East Men's Basketball Tournament and see your favorite team in action. Let's see who is going to take out the Trophy this season!
