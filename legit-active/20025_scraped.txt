KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Finding a dentist has never been easier, thanks to Assurant Employee Benefits' new smartphone application Assurant Benefit Tools. The application, now available for iPhone® and Android™ and launching soon for BlackBerry®, consists of Find-a-Dentist, which uses GoogleMaps technology to connect smartphone users with dentists in proximity to their location. Currently Assurant Employee Benefits is the only insurance benefits carrier offering smartphone technology in this way.
The Find-a-Dentist application is an extension of a similar online tool available to Assurant Employee Benefits customers. As programmers began to develop smartphone applications outside of work, Todd Rever, vice president, professional services, saw the opportunity to leverage emerging technology on the job to benefit consumers. A team was put together to think through the best use of smartphone technology, and the new application was born.
"We always look for ways to keep our products and communications relevant to our customers and sales force, and the way they use technology is always changing," says Rever. "It's very gratifying to be able to provide an industry-first tool that will help Assurant Employee Benefits connect in a new and meaningful way."
The new application also provides updates on company news and Twitter feeds.  Additional tools and enhancements will continue to be rolled out under Assurant Benefit Tools. The application is a free download available to all smartphone users.
