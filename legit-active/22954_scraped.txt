It is a blow by blow account, much like home vacation movies, full of shots of colourful markets and hordes of kids. He lives in relative luxury with his own house, a pool and three servants. The story gradually morphs into the tale of slow seduction of the 13 year old granddaughter of his cook. Grandma seems quite clueless as to what is going on. He uses ever more expensive gifts to put her in his obligation. This is quite creepy. It seems odd such a tale would be camouflaged as a documentary about what is like to work for an NGO. I was surprised to see in the credits the lead was played by an actor. I thought it was an autobiography documentary with real people.roedygNov 3, 2013PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 27, 2010 (Canada)Countries of originCanadaBurundiOfficial sitesOfficial siteOfficial site (France)LanguageFrenchFilming locationsBurundiProduction companyCoop Vidéo de MontréalSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudgetCA$1,120,000 (estimated)See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 31 minutesColorColorAspect ratio1.78 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the English language plot outline for Journal d'un coopérant (2010)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
