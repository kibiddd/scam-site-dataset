Don’t get me started on this hotel. The only good thing about this hotel is that the front desk staff are nice enough to admit that it is a bad hotel. The front door of the room wouldn’t close, there was cigarette bud holes in the blankets, that were covered in dirt. The bathroom was dirty, as well as the toilet seat. Wouldn’t recommend.Read moreDate of stay: January 20242.0 of 5 bubblesValue3.0 of 5 bubblesLocation3.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyRoom Tip: The whole hotel smells weird.See more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They could do better.  No fridge or microwave in the room, not enough towels for 4 guests, lock on door was unscrewed/loose, tv was very old and reception wasn’t the best, you could see the image but it was snowy. Lamp was unplugged, one ice machine was broken and no sign on it.  At least there was another ice machine inside the lobby and on the extreme east of the hotel quadrant.  Shampoo but no conditioner. The hair dryer appeared to have been taken off the wall.Read moreDate of stay: September 2020Trip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

No phones because they are working on being replaced. TV worked in one room but not other. Front desk and maintenance were helpful and friendly but place is a dump. Ceiling has multiple spots peeling, multiple repairs. Carpet was worn and stained. Cannot call room dirty but can it even really get clean? Beds had clean linens and were comfortable. Pool is basic but kids had fun. We saw primarily families staying here. Good stores and restaurants all around. Has a shuttle but you could ride the city bus too!Read moreDate of stay: February 2022Trip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I wondered why I got such a good rate for two weekend nights but chalked it up to wanting their unrented rooms to be filled but when I arrived I quickly realized I had unknowingly booked a sketchy hotel, had I not already paid in full before arriving I would’ve just gone to another establishment but my friend and I thought, “how bad could it be” having both been raised humble homes we were up for the challenge.  I will say at least that the sheets and bedding was clean and comfortable enough but there was literally no toilet paper, one bath towel, and even though I specifically requested a non smoking room that’s the first thing I smelled when we walked into the room, sadly enough I think it actually was a “non smoking” room.  That was just the beginning of the fun, I am not exaggerating when I say there were crack horrors a plenty, drugs being delt and consumed with young children witnessing it all and then some, yelling and screaming all hours of the night, and barely more than toddlers running around with no parental supervision often being cared for by what I assume were siblings no more than a couple years older than that.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 20242.0 of 5 bubblesValue1.0 of 5 bubblesRooms1.0 of 5 bubblesLocation2.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness4.0 of 5 bubblesService1.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The room we got reeked of smoke. The power was out in every electric outlet, so no lights except in the shower and over the sink. Thank goodness the air conditioner was on and comfortable. I had to go up to the front desk and let them know. The desk person said "oh that room, I will turn it on for you." The shower faucet was running and hard to turn off all the way. The paint in the room was pealing off the walls. We only had two small bath towels, one for each of us, no washcloth, hand towels, or a towel for the floor. The outside hallway to get to our room and the back parking lot smelled of urine and pot smoke. We did not get any ice as it was in the hall with the urine and pot smoke smell. The website advertised breakfast, there was none. The pool was closed and green. We chose not to use the facility wi-fi; we used our phone hotspots to run our computers. I know the rule is you get what you pay for, however I have stayed at other places for around same price and had much better accommodations and conditions.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: February 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

At first glance it seemed to be undergoing renovation. We originally booked a king room and was told that we would have to settle for what they have or they can cancel our reservation. We agreed to checking into a double queen room 208. This room was disgusting! One of the beds were broken the curtains did not close all the way and there seemed to be homeless drunks hanging out in the courtyard area. The maintenance of this hotel was so horrible the pain was chipping off the walls there was no cable and there wasn’t even a phone I. The room to call the front desk. the room smelled like semen. After a long day at the park I figured we would shower and maybe sleep and find a new hotel in the morning but the shower was moldy and the hall ways reales of marijuana. After checking in 2 hours later we booked elsewhere. The hotel staff agreed to refunding my money but would still charge us one full day for showering which was understandable. After checking out a few days later it seemed the hotel attempted to charge me 3 separate occasions on top of charging me my complete stay. I will never stay at a choice hotel again! This was the worse experience I’ve ever encountered.Read moreDate of stay: June 20231.0 of 5 bubblesValue1.0 of 5 bubblesLocation1.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled as a coupleRoom Tip: If you choose to stay here bring a hazmat suitSee more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was hair on the pillows and sheets, there were stains on the top sheets , the bathtub/shower and hair/dirt/dust everywhere, the carpet was dirty with hair/dirt/pieces of white garbage, there were stains behind the toilet on the floor and on the sides of the toilet on the floor, there was hair and dirt in the corners of the bathroom floor.  I didn’t expect a pristine and 5 star hotel appearance, but that room was so filthy and it should have at least been decent with cleanliness and appearance .Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: February 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The bathroom light you had to touch the plug to shut the light off! I have video of that but it won’t let me upload it. When I sent an email with our complaints in I got a call saying they would refund our money due to the HORRIBLE SERVICE and the way we were treated! It’s been almost a week and we haven’t gotten anything back! I have tried to call there multiple times because I left some items there but can’t get a hold of anybody! I will be reporting this place to the city it’s a horrible death trap! Surprised my husband and I didn’t get electric shocks from just the lights alone! Trash everywhere rooms never cleaned!

I decided to go to Orlando last minute and didn't have many hotel options in the region that I needed, I chose this one. I would have paid more and stayed in a better hotel. This hotel is disgusting, they do not clean even in the outdoor areas and much less in the apartments. the carpets are not cleaned for years, it is visible, even they say they are suitable for smoking bath, the fit to smoke. I requested 2 exchanges of apartments, the first that put me cigarette, the second sewage, the 3rd fit was less bad. I admit that if I hadn't had that expensive other hotel options I would have changed hotel. The people who attend it are strange (I am not judging anyone here, I am reporting the insecurity I felt), there were street residents who walked freely around the hotel, smoking, drinking and were not reproached at any time. So get out of this hotel. They say it's a net, but it's totally dropped, throwing the pins, literally. It was the worst experience of my whole life. Rude, rude, face closed employees. I booked the option with breakfast, at the check-pin they informed that the breakfast was (Coffee and machine juice), this was their breakfast, they should er shame inform that there is breakfast incuso, although if there were more things, I would refuse to drink coffee in a place with a level of cleaning as decadent as it is.Read moreAutomatically translatedDate of stay: August 20244.0 of 5 bubblesValue1.0 of 5 bubblesRooms4.0 of 5 bubblesLocation1.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesService1.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I looked at the hotel and didn’t this was going any luxury hotel but this  took things to a different level. As we were checking, a man came to front desk and was getting mad at the worker. He told him I’ve been staying here for 3 days and no one has come to clean the room, bring towels or take out the garbage. I should have left then but thought maybe this was one time thing. Then we got our room keys and went to our room. There was three families on this trip. My husband and I got to our room it had a cigarette smell.The room looked very worn down, the smell ,the furniture and it looked very outdated . Then I saw a dead bug smushed on the wall near the bed. As soon as we got in we all start getting settled. I went in the bathroom looked around and noticed it’s not as clean as it should be. My grandchildren were tired so they laid on the bed. My daughter yelled out to me to tell me she saw a cockroach come from the headboard and go on the pillow where my grandchild was sleeping. I then told my husband we are not staying here and I’m going to front desk. I get to the front desk and told the guy we are not staying here and we want our money back. Then I get a text from my daughter who sends a picture of the sheets which were blood stained. I showed the guy the picture at the desk and he just hand me my money back for the two room. My family and I love to travel. We stayed at a lot of hotels along the way.  But this experience at this hotel was awful. I would advise you not to stay here the price was good however the experience was not worth this.Read moreDate of stay: December 20243.0 of 5 bubblesValue1.0 of 5 bubblesRooms1.0 of 5 bubblesLocation1.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesService1.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with familyRoom Tip: This hotel standards are not at par.
