Mojo Kawasaki - 78 KR750 (Yvon DuHamel)"
Here is a late model KR750. The major updates from the 75/76 bikes being the rear "laid down" shocks and the new front end. Other engines changes were made and the carbs were secured to the frame to prevent vibration. This bike also possesses the works upgrades of magnesium parts including the carbs.
I believe this bike was raced by DuHamel at Mosport in 1978. I was brought in by Kawasaki France for Yvon for the event.
