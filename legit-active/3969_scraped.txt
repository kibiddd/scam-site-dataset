The city of bantamweight love.
"The Pride of El Salvador" Ivan Menjivar will bring his brand of violence to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Aug. 6, 2011 in a UFC 133 135-pound showdown against former Ring of Combat (ROC) standout Nick Pace.
The promotion announced the pending match-up late last night, saying:
"Bantamweights Ivan Menjivar and Nick Pace have agreed to fight each other August 6, at UFC 133 in Philadelphia," said UFC President Dana White. "Menjivar is coming off a devastating elbow KO win and Pace utilized a rarely seen type of submission to secure the victory in his last outing."
Menjivar did, in fact, obliterate his last opponent, Charlie Valencia, at the UFC 129: "St. Pierre vs. Shields" event on April 30 in Toronto.
It was his second victory over the past year after taking a four-year break from competition. It was also a not-so-friendly reminder of just how deadly the Tristar product can be.
Pace (6-1) has just two fights as a Zuffa employee, falling to Demetrious Johnson via unanimous decision at WEC 51: "Aldo vs. Gamburyan" back on September 30, 2010.
The Tiger Schulmann student rebounded by winning his UFC debut in impressive fashion, strangling Will Campuzano via Pillory choke in the waning minutes of round three at last December's Ultimate Fighter (TUF) 12 Finale.
Which one of these 135-pounders will advance to the next level of competition?
UFC 133 will  take place on August 6, 2011, from the Wells Fargo Arena in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The main event will feature former Light Heavyweight Champion Rashad Evans in a number one contender fight against top prospect Phil Davis.
Vitor Belfort vs. Yoshihiro Akiyama and Rich Franklin vs. Antonio Rogerio Nogueira are also rumored to take place on the card.
