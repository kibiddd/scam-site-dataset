BiographyTriviaIMDbProAll topicsRoy Williams(1907-1976)WriterAnimation DepartmentArt DepartmentIMDbProStarmeterSee rankRoy Williams, best known as "Roy" on
The Mickey Mouse Club (1955),
was born Joseph Roy Williams in Colville, Washington, on July 30, 1907.
His family moved to Los Angeles in 1920 after his father died and lived
with his grandmother. In 1925 he was hired by the animation studio
Hyperion Studios, which began his lifelong association with the
legendary Walt Disney. Disney sent him to
the prestigious Choinnard Art Institute, and after graduation hired him
as an artist. He worked his way up into the Art Department, eventually
becoming an animator.In the 1950s Disney moved him out of the Art Department and assigned
him as a storyboard artist for its upcoming childrens show "The Mickey
Mouse Club". Walt Disney himself picked Roy
to be co-host, with Jimmie Dodd, of the show
because, even though he was big and heavy, he was warm and gentle and
very good with children, who took to him right away.In addition to his co-hosting duties, Roy was also one of those who
picked the children who would appear on the show after they were
screened by the casting directors (for the first season, anyway; in the
later seasons he wasn't). His skill as a sketch artist was incorporated
into the show, and was used in many of the show's story lines.When the series was finally canceled, all of the cast members were let
go except Roy. He appeared on-camera occasionally in Disney specials
and showed up at various Disneyland parades, but health issues cut down
on those appearances. He finally retired in the 1970s, after almost 50
years with the Disney organization.He died on November 7, 1976.BornJuly 30, 1907DiedNovember 7, 1976(69)BornJuly 30, 1907DiedNovember 7, 1976(69)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd photos, demo reelsAdd to list
