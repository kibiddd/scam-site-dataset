Interstate 380
Home » Guides » Pennsylvania » Interstate 380
27.9 miles in length, Interstate 380 joins I-80 west of Stroudsburg with I-81 in the Scranton area in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The rural freeway heads north from the corner of Jackson and Tunkhannock townships in Monroe County to Pocono Summit west of Mount Pocono and Tobyhanna. Turning more to the west from Tobyahnna Military Reservation and Gouldsboro State Park, I-380 continues into Lackawanna County to the borough of Moscow and Interstate 84 near Elmhurst. I-84/380 overlap four miles northwest to the systems interchange with I-81 and U.S. 6 in the borough of Dunmore.
The freeway was originally designated as Interstate 81S, and then I-81E. With the completion of the route, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) sought to renumber it to avoid confusion with the differentiation of I-81 and I-81E at their junction. Correspondence with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on October 1, 1971 proposed renumbering I-81E as I-381 or I-581. It also approved the PennDOT request to extend I-84 north from their junction in Roaring Brook township to I-81 at Dunmore. PennDOT followed with the proposal to change I-81E to I-380 and with the I-80 base route designation, numbering exits from northwest to southeast. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved the changes on June 20, 1972.
