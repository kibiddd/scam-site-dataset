from Buckethead.Quotes[advice to actors wanting to be in the horror industry] First and foremost, enjoy yourself! And get paid! Get paid is my advice to actors in general. Re: the horror industry, if you're attracted to it because you really want to saw someone in half, seek psychiatric help. The horror fans, and my horror peers, have, for the most part, a very clear sense of what's real and what's fantasy. A good scare is a wonderful thing. Horror movies can make for a great date. Just make sure the blood that flows is Karo syrup and not hemoglobin!TrademarksBright, blue eyesFAQ10Powered by AlexaHow old is Bill Moseley?When was Bill Moseley born?Where was Bill Moseley born?Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentLearn more about contributingEdit page
