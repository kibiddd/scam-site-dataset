Rangers' Sean Avery Arrested in California

BOOKMARKER
New York Ranger Sean Avery was arrested and charged with battery on a police office earlier Friday, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.
Avery was having a party at his home in the Hollywood Hills a little after midnight, according to police. It was the second time officers had come to the residence after getting complaints of loud music.
When officers came to the house, Avery argued with police and attempted to go back inside his house, pushing an officer out of the way.
Avery then slammed the door and refused to come out. Officers continued to talk to the 31-year-old, asking him to come out, but he refused and additional officers were called to the location.
Avery finally did come out and was cooperative. He was then arrested for battery of a police officer, which carries a bail of $20,000, according to the Hollywood Division watch commander.
The name of his attorney wasn't immediately available.
The former Detroit Red Wings player currently plays left wing for the Rangers. He's known for both on and off the ice infractions, including making some rude comments about "sloppy seconds" when another hockey player started dating his ex-girlfriend Elisha Cuthbert.
