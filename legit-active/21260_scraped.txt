However, some things should have been addressed before anyone arrives to stay. Our first stay was in the studio cabin called Hidden Forest, which has a beautiful view. Problem was, the place and getting to the cabin, was not well kept. The stairs leading down to it were in need of total repairs and replacement. The cabin itself is nice but needed better upkeep. The closet was dirty, the shower curtain was moldy and figuring out how to use the remote control for the television was interesting as someone stole the batteries and  also required a second control.   Our second stay was in a bunkhouse room. Again the shower curtain was moldy and there were bugs crawling all over the place and even had some fall in our bed from the ceiling. Carpet needed vacuuming as dust was built up around the walls and heater.  Because we loved the location and view, and Taylor was such a good host, we decided to try one one time. Our third stay, this time with friends, we rented another room only to have an issue with a non working a/c unit, and this was in the early July during the hottest time of the month. Although Debbie tried her best to resolve the issue, it wouldn’t work. We ended up having to go to a different motel/ cabin, away from our friends. It’s unfortunate that we had all these issues as we really love the area where it’s located and the staff is great. But you should be able to expect a certain amount of maintenance and cleanness for the money. Hopefully this review will bring attention to the owners need to improve the safety and cleanliness of the property and make it become a 5 star place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 20232.0 of 5 bubblesValue5.0 of 5 bubblesLocation2.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It’s a kitschy time warp back to the 50s or 60s, which I like. It’s also by the side of the main road in and out of town which is both convenient and a little noisy at times but bearable. It gets cold at night and so has heaters in the room and which take some figuring out but once they get going do the job (one was sufficient although we like it cool – it got to 9C in April). I thought the second bed would be a bit larger as I think it said two full beds but it was in fact a full and a double. The back view is onto a wooded ravine and stream with a nice little deck. There’s a tiny kitchen area and table as well. The bathroom is smallish but not as small as some I’ve had in Europe, so if you’re European, you’ll find it fine. I picked up a couple of beer bottles out back which were spoiling the view. Breakfast consisted of a donut (deep-fried) or large cookie, apple, box juice and maybe oatmeal packets – packed in a charming basket left on your door. The coffee maker worked well, as others have noted (an absolute essential). Staff were friendly too. All in all, a nice place but keep in mind there are also over 300 private rentals in Idyllwild apparently.Read moreDate of stay: April 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was barely any leg room in front of the toilet and the dishes and cups were not very clean, so we had to wash everything. The rear veranda faced a forest, which was nice and relaxing and very enjoyable to sit, daydream and sip on coffee. There was a nature trail behind the cabin, but it was so steep that my wife lost her footing and ended up running into a tree, sustaining bruises and scrapes. Very dangerous. The owner Raj was very nice and delivered breakfast baskets to the door every morning, so I wanted to give a higher rating, but it did fall a little short of expectations.Read moreDate of stay: August 20225.0 of 5 bubblesLocation3.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness4.0 of 5 bubblesServiceRoom Tip: Try to book the largest cabin if possible.

But I left after seeing the pillows and beds they offer.  The continental breakfast is a packet of oatmeal, an apple, a kids juice box, and a scone.  It is right on the highway so they have earplugs by the bed... a bad sign. I went and stayed at my moms down the road on couch cousins on the floor, a lot less scary.Read moreDate of stay: August 20221.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesService1.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityRoom Tip: go somewhere elseSee more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Each room has beautiful wood panelling, fully equipped small kitchens with microwave, coffeemaker and refrigerator, a balcony overlooking nearby forest and mountains, daily breakfast and effective in-room heaters. There are also great Adirondack style chairs on each patio. The proprietor went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and also offered rides to and from town for guests and thru-hikers.Read moreDate of stay: April 20215.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesService5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityRoom Tip: Ask for a room with a mountain view.See more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It's a short drive into town and the room itself provides everything you possibly need. You feel immersed in your own private cabin with a balcony off the back. We loved the daily breakfast delivered in a basket with a light knock on our door in the mornings. The hosts were especially helpful when I accidentally left my personal pillow in the room after we had already left. They were kind enough to help mail it back to my home address. Would highly recommend this spot!Read moreDate of stay: May 20215.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesService4.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Whose walls were painted mismatched tacky colors because that paint was on clearance at the Home Depot? Well, that is the Idyllwild Bunkhouse. We stayed in the "Grand View" room on 8/28 and it was anything but. The floors were covered in dirt and pet hair, the walls were paper thin and the neighbors LOUD, and the AC unit sounded like jet engine. The bed felt like it was going to fall off its weird 2 x 4 stilts each time one of us turned over in the night (which was often b/c it was so uncomfortable). The room had a run down kitchen with two cups and no salt and pepper. The icing on the cake was a sad fish tank with a dead fish floating in it, and the empty and mold-filled bird feeders on the patio. In the morning someone dropped off a basket with stale scones and a rotten apple in it.Everything about this place was dirty, derelict, sad or all three.Giving two stars because the owners were nice. But come on, man. No way this room was worth $180 plus taxes and fees.Read moreDate of stay: August 20201.0 of 5 bubblesRooms1.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness4.0 of 5 bubblesServiceRoom Tip: The "Grand View" room is a dump.

I read a bunch of very positive reviews, I believe these probably come from visitors who did not have to share walls. We went for Christmas and every room was booked. I struggled to fall asleep because the person next to us had his tv on all night, it was clearly not up loud but the walls are very very thin and not insulated. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we were told there was a complaint from us talking in our room and that we could not have a conversation in our room after 9 pm. We did not use the tv or play music, just had a conversation while exchanging presents during our vacation. When a new couple arrived and I could hear their conversation WORD PER WORD through the wall, I understood the problem. The problem is so bad that I feel the owner needs to either fix and insulate the walls between rooms or put a warning on the website that the walls are so thin that you cannot have a conversation in your room. We choose not to stay the second night we had prepaid due to these issues and even after I explained these things to the owner he choose not to refund the second night. It really ruined our holiday.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019Trip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It was perfectly located near the Nature Center, where we hiked, and close to, but not in the middle of, the main square at the center of Idyllwild.  The rooms were very cabin-quaint, some roomier than others, but all perfect for us.  Things were super clean and comfortable.  A quick mountain continental breakfast was delivered to the door of the room each morning in a little picnic basket.  The host and staff were helpful and friendly.  Checking in after hours was simple.  We will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2021Trip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This place is conceptually cute and has some charm but it fails as a comfortable low cost option.  As others have said, it is in need of renovation - major renovation.  Our patio looked as if it might fall off into the woods and the teeny tiny bathroom had broken rotten wood around the shower which was old and looked dirty.  Also, there was no screen on our patio door so we could not get fresh air in at night to help the room cool down (the AC unit is both noisy and ineffective).  The positives? The owner and manager are very nice and it is super close to hiking trails and not too far from the Village but not worth the $87 I paid on Groupon.Read moreDate of stay: August 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There are others in the area for the same price, or even lower, that are WAY better maintained and managed and you will thank me later. See my review of Strawberry Creek Bunkhouse and Stone Creek Lodge, which I highly recommend.
That being said, the kitchenette is basically as follows: a sink, microwave, mini fridge, coffee machine, electric tea kettle, glasses, mugs, silverware, some plates and bowls.  If you ask, they have pots and pans and a hot plate available at the front desk. I would not recommend any serious cooking here (maybe reheating last nights leftovers would be totally feasible:). If you are looking for a place to cook, I would again recommend the Stone Creek Lodge, they have a communal fully equipped dream kitchen!! Seriously, I am a chef, and this kitchen was gorgeous!!!
