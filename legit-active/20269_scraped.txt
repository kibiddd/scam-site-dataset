Mary Pickford,
Lillian Gish and
Mary Miles Minter were dominant forces
at America's box offices. Audiences welcomed Marguerite Clark into this
group, especially those who preferred her dark brown hair and large
brown eyes to the blonde-haired, blue-eyed looks of Pickford, Gish and
Minter. She was tiny (about 4'10", weighing about 90 pounds) with a
very pretty, Kewpie-doll face that never seemed to age. Even at the end
of her career, at the age of 38, make-up artists had little trouble
making her look 12 years old. Marguerite began life on a farm southeast
of Lima, Ohio. As a child she was sent to a convent southeast of
Cincinnati for her education, remaining there until the age of 16, when
she made her stage debut with a stock company in Baltimore.
DeWolf Hopper Sr. saw her and brought
her to New York as his co-star in the play "Happyland". For over a
decade she appeared in some of the most popular plays and musicals on
Broadway, including "Anatol" with
John Barrymore. In 1914 she
signed with Famous Players, which, along with its sister companies
Paramount and Artcraft, would produce all but her last movie. Her looks
and acting talent quickly made her one of the top movie stars of the
time. However, she was dissatisfied with the acting life. In 1918 she
married a New Orleans plantation owner and took up residence there. She
split her time between New York (where she made most of her movies) and
New Orleans, all the time planning to quit acting and move permanently
to the plantation. Her only wish was to go out on top. In 1921 she got
her wish. The annual Quigley Publications poll of motion picture
exhibitors ranked her as the nation's top movie actress of 1920, and
the second-place movie star overall to
Wallace Reid. She had just completed
Scrambled Wives (1921), produced
by her own newly formed production company, for First National. After
the release of the Quigley poll, she disbanded her production company
and retired to her husband's plantation, where she lived until his
death in 1936. She moved back to New York City shortly thereafter. She
was also the model for Snow White in
Walt Disney's masterpiece
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).
She died following a short bout with pneumonia in 1940.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Steven W. Siferd <72233.741@compuserve.com>Marguerite Clark was born in Avondale, Ohio on February 22, 1883.
Growing up on an Ohio farm didn't afford a lot of opportunities for a
young lady. When she was still a youngster of 12, Marguerite was sent
to a Catholic school in Cincinnati, Ohio to complete her education. It
also gave her the chance to get off the farm and try her artistic
talents. She left the school when she was 16 to pursue her dream of
life on the stage. She joined a thespian troupe in New England and was
such a hit, she was brought to New York City where she appeared on the
prestigious stages of Broadway. Again she was a hit, a natural some
critics said. In 1914, movies were all the rage and it was only natural
that Marguerite gravitated toward them. Her first film that year was
WILDFLOWER made when she was 31 years old. Most actresses started out
at a much younger age, but not Marguerite. Her successes on the stage
precluded any "going through the ranks". She would start out on top.
While still doing some stage acting, she made one other film in 1914,
that being THE CRUCIBLE. The following years would prove very busy for
Marguerite. She appeared in eight films in 1915, seven in 1917, seven
in 1918, and eight in 1919. By the time the twenties rolled around,
Marguerite was ready to slow down. She was unhappy with acting and
yearned for a more sedate life. She had married Harry Williams from
Louisiana and was spending time between their home in the South and New
York. In 1921, at the age of 38, Marguerite made her last film entitled
SCRAMBLED WIVES whereupon she retired to the South. At the time of her
retirement, she was the top actress on the silver screen. When her
husband died in 1936, Marguerite packed up and moved back to New York.
On September 25, 1940, Marguerite died of pneumonia at the age of 57.
She had appeared in 40 films in the seven short years she was on
screen, but what an impact she had!- IMDb Mini Biography By: Denny JacksonFamilySpouseHarry Palmerson Williams(August 15, 1918 - 1936) (his death)TriviaBefore working in films, Marguerite was a big name on Broadway.One of those who saw her in Snow White (1916)) was
15-year-old Walt Disney, who later said the film had a great
impact on him. It must have--his first full-length animated film was
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).Following her marriage to Harry Palmerson-Williams, he forbade her
kissing any of her leading men.A New York Times article (February 22, 1941, page 11) stated that she left an estate of $365,436.Entered films with Famous Players.
