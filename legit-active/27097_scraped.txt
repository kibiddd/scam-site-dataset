(JUNE 24, 2011) - The Fort Lauderdale Strikers are set to host the recently crowned back-to-back Caribbean Football Union Champion Puerto Rico Islanders. The Strikers are riding a five match unbeaten streak and look to continue their scoring streak against the Islanders, having scored five times in the two matches against the defending champions. The Islanders earned a win in their last NASL match against the Atlanta Silverbacks 3 - 1, with Jonathan FaÃÂ±a adding to his goal total, making him second in the NASL with six. The match is Saturday, June 25, at 7:30 p.m. at Lockhart Stadium."We have had two very competitive games against Puerto Rico and expect the same type of game," said Strikers head coach Daryl Shore. "They are a dangerous team and we know they are going to pose a very tough challenge for us. We are going to try and keep building on our home success, but know it will not be easy."The Strikers conclude rivalry week against FC Tampa Bay on Wednesday, June 29, at 7:30p.m. at Lockhart Stadium.About the StrikersThe Fort Lauderdale Strikers have increased their season high unbeaten streak to five games following their draw against the MLS-bound Montreal Impact on the road last Saturday. The Strikers defense has been exceptional during the streak, allowing an average of just three shots on goal. Goalkeeper Matt Glaeser recorded his fourth shutout of the season, tying him for the NASL lead. The Strikers defeated Puerto Rico 3 - 2 the last time these teams met. The match was exciting with the Strikers scoring the equalizing and game winning goals in the last 10 minutes.About Puerto RicoThe Puerto Rico Islanders sit two points ahead of the Strikers in the NASL standings after their 3 - 1 victory against the Atlanta Silverbacks. Both FaÃÂ±a and Nicolas Addlery are in the top three in goal-scoring this season, with six and five respectively. They will look to provide pressure again, like they did in the previous match-up, and break down the Strikers defense.Defense and Offense Step UpThe Strikers five match unbeaten streak can be attributed to consistent play from both their defense and offense. The defense has held strong and recorded four shutouts, including two against the MLS-bound Montreal Impact. The Strikers offense has totaled six goals in two of their last three games, three against the Islanders and three against the NSC Minnesota Stars.Last Second GoalsIn the two match-ups between the Fort Lauderdale Strikers and the Puerto Rico Islanders, a total of four goals have been scored within the last 10 minutes of the games.
