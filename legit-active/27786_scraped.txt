A new community medical facility in Kirkwood has opened to provide greater healthcare convenience as St. Joseph’s Hospital makes plans to move operations to the new SSM-St. Clare hospital near Fenton.ARCO Construction Co. built the $3 million Copia Medical Office Building at 816 S. Kirkwood Road for a group of independent physician specialists.“We see a real need for maintaining quality medical care in greater Kirkwood with St. Joseph Hospital poised to move 10 miles west,” said Dan Sabio, a Copia Enterprises LLC official. “Our location in the heart of the close-knit neighborhoods of Kirkwood will enhance accessibility to healthcare services in central suburban St. Louis.”
Located on a two-acre site, the two-story, 25,0000-square-foot facility will host up to eight physician practices, including an asthma and allergy specialist and an obstetrician and gynecologist. Each practice will have a private reception and waiting area.Designed by Ross & Baruzzini, the building features a traditional brick exterior complimented by 20, two-story windows with aluminum accents.Joining ARCO on the project were Heidemann Associates, McNealy Engineering Inc., Paynecrest Electric and Communications, Wiegmann & Associates, Fire Tech LLC and Joseph H. Beetz Plumbing Co. Inc.
