Hit the deco
A special evening in Los Angeles? Try Cicada, in the gorgeous art deco Oviatt Building, a former 20s haberdashery store on South Olive Street, downtown. With elegant wood-panelling and Lalique glass, this is the luxury restaurant in which Julia Roberts had a hard time with those slippery little snails in Pretty Woman. Its not surprisingly a screen favourite: more recently, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had a bit of a spat here in Mr and Mrs Smith, it's the site of Viola Davis' briefing at the opening of Suicide Squad and it becomes a 'Roman' restaurant for Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.
Cicada, Downtown Los Angeles
Sheer torture...
Yes, Eli Roth fans, there really is a Museum of Torture â and it is the one seen in Hostel. It's not in Slovakia, though, but in the beautiful Medieval village of ÄeskÃ½ Krumlov, in the Czech Republic, where much of the film was shot. It's not tucked away down a creepy staircase (hello, this is a major tourist attraction!) but on the village's main square.
