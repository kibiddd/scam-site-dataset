To turn around its ailing football team, Calvert University hires James Gore (Pat O'Brien) -- a coach renowned for producing results. But his successes are often achieved at the expense of academic ethics. Gore uses cash to lure athletes to the team and cuts deals with teachers to pass his players. But one of the team's stars, Phil Sargeant (Dick Powell), doesn't like the game that Gore is running. Meanwhile, the coach's wife, Claire (Ann Dvorak), is looking elsewhere for romance.
