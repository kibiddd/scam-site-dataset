XLI. GUARDS
FOOT ARTILLERY.
[Gvardeiskaya peshaya artilleriya.]
9 April 1801 - Lower ranks
of the foot companies in the L.-Gds. Artillery Battalion were ordered to cut
off their curls [pukli] and have queues
[kosy] only 4 vershoks [7 inches] long, tying them midway down the
collar (1).
10 May 1801 - Train
officers [furshtatskie ofitsery] in the L.-Gds. Artillery
Battalion were prescribed to have the uniforms as other officers in this
battalion, except with green pants (2).
18 May 1801 - Lower
combatant ranks of the foot companies in the L.-Gds. Artillery
Battalion were given dark-green coats. These were of the same pattern
as prescribed at this time for lower combatant ranks of Army and Guards
Infantry, with a collar and cuffs of black worsted velvet [trip] or
black plissé [plis]. There were flaps on the cuffs andfor gun
handlers [gandlangery], cannoneers, and bombardiersalso a strap on
the left shoulder, of black cloth with red cloth piping. There was the same
sewn-on tape on the collar and cuff flaps as in the L.-Gds. Preobrazhenskii
Regiment. The skirt turnbacks were of black cloth trimmed with red cloth
piping, and the lining was black kersey (Illus. 2138). Small clothes were of
pale straw-colored cloth. The hat tassels were yellow with a dark-green center.
Boots, with a a notch cut out in the back, and all other items of clothing,
accouterments, and arms were prescribed to be as for Army Foot Artillery,
except that buttons, sword hilts, short-sword hooks and chapes, and metal
fittings to sword belts, powder holders, crossbelts, and knapsack straps were
all of copper (red brass) as for the rest of the Guards. Also, the crossbelt
for drummers was trimmed with yellow and red tape. Officers had gold
embroidered buttonhole loops on the coats collar and cuff flaps, and a gold
aiguilette on the right shoulder. Otherwise, they were distinguished from lower
ranks in the same way as throughout the Infantry, except that they were not
authorized gorgets (Illus. 2138) (3).
11 June 1801 -
Small clothes for all combatant ranks, as well as the
gloves of non-commissioned officers and officers, were ordered
to be white instead of the previous pale straw color (Illus. 2138)
(4).
27 October 1802 - Generals
and field and company-grade officers, when on the march with troops or on
detached duties, were ordered to wear, instead of white pants, gray
riding trousers with brass buttons and leather reinforcement,
identical to those established at this time for generals and field and
company-grade officers of Army and Guards Infantry and Cavalry
(5).
16 June 1803 - The small
clothes of officers of the train [furshtatskie
ofitsery] was ordered to be gray instead of green (6).
29 June 1803 - Generals and
field and company-grade officers were ordered to have the same
shabracks and pistol carriers as given at
this time to generals and field and company-grade officers of Army Foot
Artillery, but with velvet inlay instead of cloth, and with the addition of
silver Guards stars (Illus. 2139) (7).
19 August 1803 - Lower
ranks were given cloth headdresses in place of hats, of the
same pattern as received on 19 October 1804 by the L.-Gds. Preobrazhenskii,
Semenovskii, and Izmailovskii Regiments, but without plumes. These had the same
two small tassels as were on the hat, i.e. yellow outside and dark green in the
middle (Illus. 2140 and 2141) (8).
17 December 1803 -
Confirmation was given to a new table of uniforms, accouterments, and
weapons for the L.-Gds. Artillery Battalion, based on which the lower
ranks of its foot companies kept all their previous uniform clothing and arms,
with only the removal of red piping from cuff flaps. Around this time field and
company-grade officers began to wear hats with a buttonhole
loop made from thin gold galloon instead of being embroidered, and with a tall
plume, as already mentioned above for officers of Army and Guards Infantry and
Cavalry (Illus. 2142) (9).
4 January 1805 - The round
powder flasks [porokhovyya natruski] used by
bombardiers, cannoneers, and gun handlers were replaced by
pouches [lyadunki ili podsumkami] of the same pattern
as that introduced at this time for Army Foot Artillery, except with a badge of
copper [red brass] (Illus. 2143) (10).
1 October 1806 - The
sheepskin warm coats [ovchinnyya fufaiki] and
short coats [polushubki] authorized for lower ranks
up to now were withdrawn (11), and about this time HIGHEST Confirmation was given to rules drawn up
under the direct supervision of the then Inspector of All Artillery, General
Graf Arakcheev, regarding the sewing, cut, fitting, and wear of lower ranks
uniforms and accouterments. These rules, set
forth above under Army Foot Artillery, were extended with equal force to foot
companies of the L.-Gds. Artillery Battalion (12).
10 March 1807-
Canes were withdrawn for officers (13).
17 September 1807 -
Generals and field and company-grade officers were ordered to wear a gold
epaulette on the left shoulder, of the pattern established for
the rest of the Guards, and on the right shouldera gold aiguilette, as before
(Illus. 2144) (14). From this year onward these ranks stopped
wearing queues and continued to powder their hair only for
grand parades and appearances at HIGHEST
Court. For lower ranks hair powder was completely eliminated
and queues cut off short (15).
26 September and 19 December
1807 - Lower ranks were ordered to wear sword belts
not around the waist, but over the right shoulder, as would be introduced on 7
March 1808 for Army Foot Artillery (Illus. 2145) (16).
23 December 1807 - Lower
ranks were given new pattern summer and winter pants of the
pattern confirmed at this same time for Army and Guards Infantry, i.e. the
former with spats and the latter with leather trim or leggings
[kragi], with seven brass buttons. Company-grade officers when in
summer uniform were ordered to wear the same pants as lower ranks, and in
winterboots reaching to under the knee, without any cutout behind short
(17).
3 January 1808 - Private
lower ranks were ordered to have to have red shoulder straps on both shoulders.
Pompons on the regulation headdress were to be white with a
red center (Illus. 2145), and the the loop above the tassel on forage caps and
the ring and loop of the sword knot were to be according to the company: in the
first battery company - white, in the second battery company - red, in the
first light company - sky blue, and in the second light company - green
(18).
26 January 1808 - Generals
at parades, on designated calendar days [tabelnye dni], and at troop
formations in general, in peacetime as well as during wartime, were ordered to
wear the newly introduced standard generals coat
[obshchii generalskii mundir]. And with the coat of the Guards Foot
Artillery, when not on duty, they were to have dark-green pants instead of
white (19).
(Note: A description of the standard
general-officers coat is located below, at the end of the treatment of EMPEROR
ALEXANDER Is reign, in the chapter on generals uniforms.)
16 April 1808 - Privates
and field and company-grade officers of foot companies in the Guards Artillery
were given shakos [kivera] of the same pattern as
established at this time for the L.-Gds. Preobrazhenskii, Semenovskii, and
Izmailovskii Regiments, but without a plume and with a different pattern of
front plate, one depicting a two-headed eagle sitting on two crossed cannons,
below which lay various artillery munitions (Illus. 2146, 2147, and 2148)
(20).
14 July 1808 - The round
knapsacks used by lower ranks were exchanged for rectangular
ones of the same pattern as those received at this time by Army and Guards
Heavy Infantry and Army Artillery. Along with this, it was set forth as a rule
that when the greatcoat was not being worn it was to be
carried in accordance with same directives as described above in detail under
grenadier uniforms (Illus. 2146) (21).
28 November 1808 [sic, should be 2 November
- M.C.] - The winter pants with leather cuffs and the summer
ones with spats, authorized on 23 December 1807, were kept only for combatant
lower ranks, while for noncombatants the pants as well as the boots were
ordered to be of the old patterns, i.e. the latter halfway up the calf [v
pol ikry], with a cutout in the back (22).
5 November 1808 - Company-grade officers,
when the troops were wearing knapsacks, were ordered to also
have them, of the same pattern in all respects as was established for lower
ranks (Illus. 2147) (23).

pants instead of white (24).
27 March 1809 - Instead of
one epaulette, generals and field and company-grade officers
were ordered to wear two, and consequently the aiguilettes which had been in

personnel began to wear on their dress coats, instead of buttonhole loops, the
newly established gold embroidery (Illus. 2149)
(26).
4 April 1809 -
Noncommissioned officers were ordered to have galloon not on
the lower and side edges of the collar, but on the upper and side edges
(27).

in the manner of wearing the knapsack, introduced at this time
throughout the Infantry and described above in detail for Grenadier regiments
as well as the L.-Gds. Preobrazhenskii, Semenovskii, and Izmailovskii
Regiments, i.e. with the addition of a third chest strap, was extended to foot
companies of the Guards Artillery (Illus. 2150) (28).
24 May 1809 - Field and
company-grade officers of the Guards Foot Artillery were given
gorgets [znaki] of the same pattern as those
established at this time for the L.-Gds. Izmailovskii Regiment (Illus. 2151)
(29).
8 June 1809 - The plumage
on generals' hats was discontinued. The hats former pattern
of embroidered buttonhole was replaced with a new one made of four thick,
twisted cords, of which the two middle ones were intertwined with each other as
if in a plait (Illus. 2151) (30).
11 June 1809 - Combatant lower ranks were
ordered to have red shako cords and pompons
(Illus. 2152), while for non-commissioned officers the cords were to be
multicolored, i.e. white, black, and orange, with the pompon as before: two
quarters white and two black with orange (Illus. 2152) (31).
6 December 1809 - Instead of the former
fine chain on the shako, field and company-grade officers were
ordered to flat scales, as established at this time for officers of Guards
Infantry (Illus. 2153) (32). In this same year any hair
powder still being used by generals and officers was abolished, and
they were allowed to wear frock coats of the same pattern as
received by officers of Army Artillery, except with a velvet collar and without
red piping (33).
10 February 1810 - Instead of a single chin
strap, lower ranks shakos were given two chin straps with
flat copper chinscales (Illlus. 2154). Officers were ordered to have completely
silver shako cords without any addition of black or orange silk, and to shorten
the plumes on their hats (Illus. 2155) (34).
24 September 1810 - The
knapsack straps for lower ranks were ordered to be stitched at
the edges, in the manner of crossbelts and sword belts, and have a bend at each
shoulder so that they do not wear away the coat and are not constricting under
the arms (35).
17 January 1811 - Instead of the
multicolored cords on their shakos, noncommissioned officers
and musicians were ordered to have red ones, the cords tassels being white

lower ranks were given a new pattern of forage cap, identical

(37).
3 November 1811 - Gloves
were discontinued for non-commissioned officers, and in their place in cold
weather they were allowed to wear cloth mittens sewn from old tailcoats, as
done at this time for privates (38). Also, from this year forward
non-commissioned officers stopped carrying canes
(39).
In January 1812 - All combatant ranks were
ordered to have shakos and collars of a new
style, lower than previously. The first item had a greater spread or widening
toward the top and concave sides, and the second was closed in front and had
red cloth piping around it. At this time red piping was also added to cuffs and
cuff flaps (Illus. 2157). Along with these changes, lower ranks were given
integral leggings [kragi] reaching up to the knees,
with nine buttons instead of seven, and the previous sewn-on
tape on the coats, with a checked design, was replaced with
sewn-on buttonhole loops made from yellow woolen tape with orange stripes. This
tape was also used to trim the coats of musicians and drummers. There was a red
light, or thin stripe, on this tape, and a black light on the buttonhole loops
on the collar and cuff flaps (Illus. 2157) (40). The change in
collar pattern as described here, there was a change in the gold
embroidery on officers coats, consisting of the loops
slanted aspect becoming straightened so as to conform to the collars new
upright edges (Illus. 2157).
10 February 1812 - Lower noncombatant ranks
were given the same uniform as prescribed on this date for
regiments of Guards Infantry, but with black piping and red shoulder straps

were ordered to change their previous riding trousers
[reituzy] with leather reinforcements and buttons to ones without

(42).
28 May 1814 - All combatant ranks were
given hair plumes for their shakos, black for privates and
officers, red for drummers, and for personnel holding non-commissioned officer
rankwith a white top with a longitudinal yellow stripe, similar to the
existing distinction in Army and Guards Infantry (Illus. 2159 and 2160)
(43). In this same year it was ordered to have white tape around the
cockades on officers hats, which later became silver. In 1815
uniforms for drum majors were introduced, identical to those
prescribed at this time for drum majors in regiments of the Old Guard
(44).
22 December 1815 - White
cloth pants were withdrawn for all combatant ranks, and
dark-green pants were to be worn at all times (45).

(46).
12 May 1817 - With the formation of the 1st
and 2nd L.-Gds. Artillery Brigades from the single L.-Gds. Artillery
Brigade, their combatant personnel were ordered to have black
turnbacks or lapels [otvoroty ili latskany] on their dress coats
(velvet for officers, plissé for lower ranks), with red cloth piping. The
brigades were distinguished from each other by their cuff flaps: 1st Brigade -
red (Illus. 2161, 2162, and 2163); 2nd Brigade - dark green with red piping
(Illus. 2164 and 2165)(47). Besides this, the 2nd Brigade followed
the example of the 2nd Guards Infantry Divisions regiments (Moscow, Grenadier,
Pavlovsk, and Finland) in being given for their greatcoat collars red cloth
patches with a brass button (gilt for officers) (Illus. 2166) (48).
The first battery companies of both brigades received sword knots with a red
tassel, the second battery companies with a white tassel, and the light
companies a blue [svetlosinii] knot (49).
13 May 1817 - In order to
relieve combatant lower ranks while on campaign and to protect their
accouterments, it was laid down that during such times they were always to be
in greatcoats and that their shako, plume, pouch, and uniform with leggings
were to have covers [chekhly] of ravens-duck or
Flemish linen painted with black oil paint, in all respects according to the
instructions set forth on this subject at this same time for all Army and
Guards Infantry and Army Foot Artillery (50).
8 August 1817 - The size of
the forage cap was laid down as described above in detail for
Grenadier regiments (51).

manner of wearing them in the Guards heavy infantry, issued on this date, was
extended with equal force to the Guards Foot Artillery (52).

ordered that for lower ranks the leather cuffs on cloth pants
were to have spat-like projections [kozyr'ki] of a pattern similar to
the spats on summer pants (53).

established L.-Gds. Foot Battery Company No. 5 in Warsaw was
prescribed to have the same uniform as the L.-Gds. 1st Artillery Brigade, but
with black cloth spats (for lower ranks) instead of leather pants cuffs (Illus.
2167), and an image of a Lithuanian horseman on the shako plates shield and on
officers gorgets. Also, field-grade officers were ordered to not wear
bottes fortes [botforty] as in the two Guards Artillery
brigades, but the boots of company-grade officers that only
reached to the knees, with spurs (Illus. 2168) (54).
21 March 1818 - In order to
be distinguished from L.-Gds. Battery Company No. 5, the coats of the
L.-Gds. 1st Artillery Brigade were ordered to have white cloth
piping on the cuff flaps (Illus. 2169) (55).
23 August 1818 - The length
and width of shoulder straps on tailcoats and greatcoats was
defined, identical to that laid down at this time for Army and Guards Infantry
and described above in detail for Grenadier regiments (56). It was
also confirmed that musicians and drummers coats would have red shoulder
wings or swallows nests [plechevye klapany ili kryl'tsa]
(57).
25 January 1819 -
Drumsticks and the handles of entrenching
tools were ordered to be be yellow (58).
4 April 1819 - For lower
ranks in the 1st and 2nd Brigades the spats on the leggings
were removed (59).
20 September 1820 - Field
and company-grade officers throughout the Guards Foot Artillery were given a
new pattern gorget, identical to that established at this time
for Guards Infantry regiments, but without the inscription 1700 NO 19 as in
the Preobrazhenskii and Semenovskii Regiments (Illus. 2170). In the companies
of the 1st and 2nd Brigades there was, on the eagles shield on these gorgets,
an image of St. George, as previously, and for the L.-Gds. Battery Company No.
5 the image of a Lithuanian horseman was kept (60). In this same
year the sewn-on chevrons on the coats of musicians and
drummers began to be placed closer together, almost touching one another, and
on the swallows nests the tape was no longer perpendicular as before, but at a
diagonal toward the lower edge. Also, all four sides of the collar began to be
trimmed with this tape (Illus. 2171) (61).
26 November 1823 - All
musicians, even though they might not hold non-commissioned
officer ranks, were ordered to have: gold galloon on the coat and
non-commisioned officers pompons on the shakos. This did not apply to drummers
if they did not hold non-commissioned officer rank (62).
16 January 1824 - The
following changes were ordered in the uniforms and accouterments of combatant
lower ranks:
1) Coattails, which up to
this time had one covering the other, were to be cut so that their inner edges
came together, and sewn together where they touched (Illus. 2172).
2.) To the decorative end
[trinchik] of the shako cords, which was to be level
with the right shoulder, was to be added a special loop of white cord attached
to the button on the right shoulder strap, so that the shako cords would stay
in place when the soldier moved about (Illus. 2172).
3.) The knapsack chest
strap was to be fitted so that it passed between the third and fourth buttons
of the coat, as counted from the bottom (Illus. 2172) (63).
From this year, officers as well as lower
ranks began to wear a taller shako with wider cords (Illus.
2172 and 2173), but no regulations were issued in this regard
(64).
29 March 1825 - For
combatant lower ranks, for faultless service, there were established
stripes [nashivki] to be sewn on the left sleeve: for
10 years service - one, for 15 years - two, for 20 years - three; one over the
other, all of yellow tape (65).

previousi.e. thick and denseplumes (85).
27 March 1809 - Instead of one
epaulette, generals and field and company-grade officers are
ordered to wear two, and consequently the aiguilettes which had been in use are

of the concave pattern prescribed since 1812 (Illus. 2204, 2205, and 2206).
Also, in each Sapper company, for use during training exercises, black iron
helmets and cuirasses are authorized for one
officer, one non-commissioned officer, and four sappers. For miners, in case

cocked fore-and-aft [shlyapy nadevat' s polya] (Illus. 2225)
(146).
XLVII . GUARDS GARRISON.
[Gvardeiskii garnizon.]
In 1801 and 1802, with the
general change in Guards uniforms, there were no special directives for the
L.-Gds. Garrison Battalion. It was only ordered to follow the
example of the L.-Gds. Preobrazhenskii Regiment as it did during the preceding
Reign, having white buttons; grenadier caps of regular army pattern with a red
top, white tin front plate and band, and a red tassel in the center; silver
embroidery on officers coats, these being without aiguillettes (Illus. 2226
and 2227). Neither were officers authorized gorgets (147). Based on
this, the uniform clothing and weapons of the L.-Gds. Garrison Battalion

privates are ordered to have two shoulder straps.
19 October 1804 - Combatant lower
ranksinstead of grenadier capsare ordered to have a cloth
headdress with a visor and thick hair plume (Illus. 2228). Beginning

shakos [kivera] with a plate, cords of red and yellow
wool, and a pyramidal plume (Illus. 2231).
Officers, when in formation or on other duties, receive the
same shakos with those distinctions that distinguishes them from lower ranks.
In this same year, the previous embroidery on their coats was replaced by
buttonhole loops (Illus. 2232).

when the troops are wearing knapsacks, are ordered to also
have them, in all ways of the same pattern as is established for lower

brass trigger guard. The button on the sling is to be located two fingers from
the upper sling bracket. A buckle with prong is to be fixed to the middle of
the ramrods brass lower band or tube, and the upper side, i.e. the side
painted red, of the sling is to be lacquered so that it would not stain the
pouch crossbelt.
20 April 1809 - Supplementary instructions
are issued for the directives of 14 July 1808 concerning
knapsacks and greatcoats.
30 May 1809 - Non-commissioned officers
with muskets and front pouches [podsumki] have the latter item
replaced with pouches [sumy] of the same pattern as
for privates. Consequently, these men as well as all personnel of
non-commissioned officer rank, and also company drummers and fifers, are given
shoulder straps on both shoulders (Illus. 2233).
29 August 1809 - Halberds
are retained only for first sergeants [feldfebeli], while all other
non-commissioned officers were given muskets identical to soldiers.

to a table of uniform clothing and other items for the
battalion, based on which its uniforms remain as before.
6 December 1809 - Officers
shakos are given the same plumes as for lower ranks, and
scales for the chinstrap instead of the small chain (Illus. 2234) In this same
year officers were given frock coats and their canes and hair
powder were abolished.
10 February 1810 - Chinscales are added to
lower ranks shakos, which at the same time are ordered to
have white cords instead of multi-colored ones, except for non-commissioned
officers with their multi-colored tassels and slides (Illus. 2235). Officers
receive entirely silver cords, and for all combatant ranks in the battalion a
new pattern shako plume is confirmed, narrower at the bottom than at the top
(Illus. 2235 and 2236). Also, the plumes on officers hats are
shortened (Illus. 2236).

to have forage caps of the new pattern, dark green with a red
band, plus a cockade for officers.

halberds that had been retained by first sergeants are
withdrawn, and they were given muskets and cartridge pouches.

given: a shako lower than before, with a concave top;
collars closed by small hooks; for lower ranks only sewn-on
tape of yellow with orange stripes and a red light; integral
leggings [kragi] reaching up to the knees, with nine
buttons (Illus. 2237 and 2238).
In 1814 white tape was added around the
cockades of officers hats, which later became silver.
31 December 1815 - The L.-Gds. Garrison
Battalion is ordered to have, instead of red collars,
dark-green collars with red piping (Illus. 2239, 2240, and 2241)
(148).

pants.
23 August 1818 - The length and width of
shoulder straps are defined.

on the leggings are removed.
In 1820 there were changes in the uniforms
of musicians, fifers, and drummers, consisting of their
sewn-on chevrons beginning to be placed closer together, almost touching one
another, and on the swallows nests the tape was no longer perpendicular as
before, but at a diagonal toward the lower edge. Also, all four sides of the
collar began to be trimmed with this tape (Illus. 2242).
26 November 1823 - All the battalions
musicians, even though they might not hold non-commissioned
officer ranks, are ordered to have: silver galloon on the coat; plumes on the
shakos with non-commissioned officers tops and non-commissioned officers
pompons. This does not apply to fifers and drummers who do not hold
non-commissioned officer rank.
16 January 1824 - The following changes are
ordered in the uniforms and accouterments of combatant lower ranks:
1) Coattails, which up to this time had one
covering the other, are to be cut so that their inner edges came together, and
sewn together where they touched (Illus. 22434).
2.) To the decorative end [trinchik] of the
shako cords, which is to be level with the right shoulder,
there is to be added a special loop of white cord attached to the button on the
right shoulder strap, so that the shako cords stay in place when the soldier
moves about (Illus. 2243).
3.) The cartridge pouch is to be worn so
that when the soldier bent his elbow, the distance between it and a line with
the top edge of the pouch is equal to 3 vershoks [5 1/4 inches].
4.) The knapsack chest strap is to be
fitted so that it passes between the third and fourth buttons of the coat, as
counted from the bottom (Illus. 2243).
5.) On the musket sling, opposite the
cocking piece, there is to be a band of the same kind of leather as the sling,
for stowing the flint cover [ognivnyi chekhol] when it needs to be
removed (Illus. 2243).
In this same year officers as well as lower ranks began to
wear a taller shako with wider cords (Illus. 2243 and 2244),
but no specific instructions were officially issued for this.
29 March 1825 - For combatant lower ranks,
for faultless service, there are established stripes [nashivki] to be
sewn on the left sleeve: for 10 years service - one, for 15 years - two, for 20
years - three; one over the other, all of yellow tape (149).
XLVIII . GUARDS INVALIDS.
[Gvardeiskii invalid.]
27 January 1809 - Guards Invalid
companies are ordered to have: gray coat and pants, the first without
any sewn-on lace, with red collar, shoulder straps, cuffs, and skirt turnbacks;
boots reaching below the knee; and a forage cap of gray cloth with a red band
and a gray and red tassel (Illus. 2245). Officers were uniformed as officers in
the L.-Gds. Garrison Battalion but did not have buttonhole loops on their
coats, nor shakos (150).
23 September 1811 - Lower
ranks are given forage caps of a new pattern, identical to
that introduced at this time throughout the Army, colored gray as before, with
a red band on which was the company number in yellow (Illus. 2246)
(151).
In 1812 the high open
collars were replaced by lower ones closed with small hooks
(Illus. 2246) (152).
31 December 1815 - Guards
Invalid companies are given new uniforms, the same as received
at this time by the L.-Gds. Garrison Battalion, but without piping on the
collar, dark-green cuffs, and a shako without a plume. Lower ranks are given
short swords [tesaki] on a white crossbelt (Illus. 2247 and 2248)
(153). Non-serving Guards Invalids, who would be disbanded in 1823,
are ordered to have all items as for the preceding serving Invalids, but the
coat and pants were gray (Illus. 2249) (154).
After 1815 the changes
related above for the L.-Gds. Garrison Battalion were also applied to Guards
Invalids, who in 1824 received taller shakos
with wider cords than previously, with lower ranks also having tailcoats with
the skirts sewn together (Illus. 2250 and 2251). Invalid personnel with the
Guards troops in Warsaw were distinguished from other Guards
Invalids by the yellow color of their cuff flaps and skirt
turnbacks (155).
XLIX . GUARDS ÉQUIPAGE.
[Gvardeiskii Ekipazh.]
23 February 1810 - A table of uniforms and
other items for the Guards Équipage is confirmed, based on
which the following are authorized:
For Privates (youths and sailors) [Ryadovye (mladshie
yungi i matrosy)]: double-breasted jacket [kurtka] of dark-green
cloth, with white cloth piping on the collar, cuffs, and cuff flaps; with
Guards checkered tape sewn on the collar and cuff flaps; red shoulder straps
and brass buttons; single-breasted (under the jacket) vest [zhilet ]
of dark-green cloth, without sleeves, with covered buttons; winter pants of
dark-green cloth, and summer ones of Flemish linen; boots and neckcloth, of the
same patterns as for other Infantry; round black hat with a Guards pattern
plate to which is added only two crossed anchors (Illus. 2252 and 2253);
greatcoat, of normal infantry pattern, of gray cloth, with collar and shoulder
straps of the same colors as on the jacket, with brass buttons. In summertime,
when not on duty they are to wear a jacket and pants of striped ticking (white
with dark blue), patterned after the cloth items except that the first has
covered buttons and no shoulder straps, cuffs, or cuff flaps (Illus. 2254).
Under the summer jacket is worn a white vest of ticking with one row of covered
buttons (156).
Non-commissioned officers (quartermasters, boatswain mates,
and boatswains [Unter-ofitsery (kvartirmeistery, botsmanmaty i
botsmany]) are distinguished by gold galloon on the collar and cuffs on
the cloth jacket, and have gloves and a cane (Illus. 2255). Their summer
clothing is not striped but white (Illus. 2256) (157).
Of noncombatant ranks, the assistant storekeeper and cooks
[unter-bataler i povara] are uniformed as privates, while the
storekeeper, medical orderly, clerk, and steersman assistants [bataler,
fel'dsher, klerk i shkiperskie pomoshchniki] as non-commissioned officers
(158).
Company-grade officers (Midshipmen and Lieutenants
[Michmany i Leitenanty]) wear a dark-green double-breasted tailcoat
with the same buttons as throughout the Guards Infantry, with gold embroidery
on the collar and cuff flaps depicting an anchor fouled with rope and cable;
gold edging on the collar, cuffs, and cuff flaps; gold epaulettes as for all
Guards company-grade officers, with red cloth backing (Illus. 2257 and 2258).
Dark-green cloth pants are prescribed for winter dress, and in summerwhite
linen. In both seasons they wear an infantry pattern three-cornered hat without
a plume, and an officers sword [shpaga] with a silver sword knot
(Illus. 2257). Field-grade officers (Captain-Lieutenant and 1st or 2nd Rank
Captain [Kapitan-Leitenant i Kapitan 2-go ili 1-go ranga]) are
distinguished only by fringe on the epaulettes (Illus. 2259). When not on duty
all officers wear a double-breasted dark-green undress coat
[vitse-mundir] with embroidered gold buttonhole loops on the collar
and cuff flaps, and instead of a sworda dagger [kortik] with a white
bone handle and gilt fittings. Officers greatcoats are the same as in the
Army, with a dark-green cloth collar (159).
Cannoneers of the Guards Équipage Artillery Command
[Artilleriiskoi komandy Gvardeiskago Ekipazha kanoniry] are uniformed
like sailors, but instead of dark-green collars and cuffs they have black, and
on their hats are two crossed cannons. Bombardiers [bombardiry] are
distinguished by gold galloon on the collar and wore gloves. They have a cane
and a short sword [tesak] in a black lacquered scabbard on a likewise
black lacquered crossbelt that is two vershoks [3-1/2 inches] wide (Illus.
2261). The metalsmith [slesar'] in the command is uniformed the same
as cannoneers, and the commissioned officers (Sub-Lieutenant and Lieutenant
[Unter-Leitenant i Leitenant]) differ from the Équipage officers only
in the black color of the collar and cuffs (Illus. 2262) (160).
In 1811 non-commissioned officers
gloves and canes were withdrawn, as were all
lower ranks winter and summer vests and summer clothing
except for the white pants prescribed for wear with the cloth jackets. In place
of round hats, the Équipages privates were given the infantry
shakos of that time, with the same plate as the hat, white
cords, and a dark-green pompon. They also received infantry
muskets and jäger pouches with a brass anchor on the cover,
along with attached bayonet scabbards (Illus. 2263). Non-commissioned officers
of the Équipage received shakos, muskets, pouches, and infantry short swords
with non-commissioned officers sword knots (Illus. 2264). The
Artillery detachment received shakos with red cords and
pompon, and bombardiers and cannoneers were given short swords and pouches on
crossbelts, on one of which were prickers (Illus. 2265) Along with these
changes, the Équipage was authorized drummers, fifers, and
musicians, uniformed as the other combatant lower ranks, with the
distinctions established for all Guards Infantry, the drum hoops and drumsticks
being black (Illus. 2266 and 2267). Officers in formation or
on parade were ordered to also be in shakos, and instead of swords, they were
to always have sabers, with a gilded hilt and a scabbard of black lacquered
leather. Hooks and chape were gilded. These sabers were worn on a crossbelt of
black lacquered leather over the right shoulder, over the coat (Illus. 2268)
(161).
In 1812 the
shakos and collars began to be lower than
before, the first with a concave top and the second without a diagonal opening
in front, being closed with small hooks and having, for lower ranks, the same
sewn-on tape as the rest of the Guards (Illus. 2269, 2270,
2271, and 2272) (162).
1817 - In regard to the
shape of the shako and construction of
accouterments, the Guards Équipage was guided by the same
directives as set forth for the rest of the Guards on 26 September of that
year, described in detail above for Grenadier regiments (Illus. 2273, 2274,
2275, and 2276) (163).
In 1820 the
tape on the coats of drummers, fifers, and musicians began to
be sewn on more closely together, and around the entire collar (Illus. 2277)
(164).
In 1824 the
shako began to become taller and the shako cords wider, the
latter having a loop to attach to the button on the right shoulder strap and
epaulette, as related above regarding shakos in the Army and Guards (Illus.
2278). Along with this, the knapsack chest strap was to be
fitted between the fourth and fifth buttons of the coat instead of the second
and third as was done before, counting from the collar (165).
29 March 1825 - For
combatant lower ranks, for faultless service, there are established
stripes [nashivki] to be sewn on the left sleeve, of
yellow tape of the same appearance and according to the same rules as described
above for the Army and Guards (166).
In addition to the uniform clothing items
described here for the Guards Équipage, those field and company-grade officers
who were prescribed to be mounted when in formation were given dark-green cloth
shabracks and pistol carriers, with two rows
of gold galloon and the usual pattern of Guards star in silver (Illus. 2279)
(167).
L . INSTRUCTIONAL GRENADIER
BATTALIONS and the INSTRUCTIONAL CARABINIER REGIMENT.
[Uchebnye grenaderskie bataliony i Uchebnyi Karabinernyi
polk.]
20 June 1808 - All uniform clothing,
accouterments, and weapons for the Instructional Grenadier Battalion
are prescribed to be the same as used at this time in Army Grenadier
regiments, except that the shoulder straps were trimmed with two rows of woolen
tape, colored red with yellow stripes along the sides andbetween the
stripesyellow circles [kruzhki] (Illus. 2280, 2281, and 2282). The
field on officers epaulettes was not cloth, as in Grenadier regiments, but
gold, in the manner of the Guards (Illus. 2283) (168). Subsequent
HIGHEST orders and regulations confirmed

band to the musket sling for the firing cover. Since 1824 the
Instructional Carabinier Regiment, after the example of other regiments, began

(175).
LI. INSTRUCTIONAL CAVALRY

Cavalry Squadron  is prescribed all the same uniform clothing,
accouterments, and arms and laid down in this year for Army Dragoon regiments,
except with shoulder straps of the pattern used in Instructional Grenadier
battalions (red with yellow tracery). Collar, cuffs, coattail lining and
turnbacks, and saddlecloth trim were red. Buttons were yellow (Illus. 2300,
2301, and 2302 (176). Subsequent HIGHEST orders and regulations confirmed by
HIGHEST Authority for Army Dragoon

Instructional Cavalry Squadron, viz.: 16 June 1810 - on making
musketoons according to a new pattern and henceforth calling them dragoon

prongs, and end pieces from cartridge-pouch belts, as well as belt hooks and

attachment to the button of the right epaulette (Illus. 2308)
(177).
LII . INSTRUCTIONAL ARTILLERY
BRIGADE.
[Uchebnyi Artilleriiskaya brigada.]

can be seen from examination of HIGHEST
Confirmed equipment tables for them.)
28 May 1820 - All uniform clothing,
accouterments, and weapons for the Instructional Artillery
Brigade are ordered to be the same as used in this year in Grenadier
Artillery brigades, except that the shoulder straps of lower ranks are trimmed
with tape, yellow with thin red stripes, and officers have epaulettes with a
gold field instead of cloth, and no number, as in the Instructional Carabinier
Regiment (Illus. 2309 and 2310)(178). Subsequent orders in
1824 on sewing coattails together, adding a loop to the
decorative right end of the shako cords, fitting the knapsack chest strap so
that it passed between the fourth and fifth coat buttons as counted from the
collar, and having taller shakos and wider shako cords (Illus. 2311 and 2312),
were all applied to the Instructional Artillery Brigade (179).
LIII . INSTRUCTIONAL SAPPER
BATTALION.
[Uchebnyi Sapernyi batalion.]
21 May 1820 - The Instructional
Sapper Battalion is ordered to have all uniform clothing,
accouterments, and weapons the same as it had before being renamed from the 2nd
Sapper Battalion, except that lower ranks shoulder straps were to be as in the
Instructional Carabinier Regiment and Instructional Artillery Brigade, and
officers epaulettes were to have a silver field instead of cloth, and without
a number (Illus. 2313, 2314, and 2315) (180).
Subsequent HIGHEST orders of 26
November 1823 - on all musicians coats to have non-commissioned
officers galloon and their shakos to have non-commissioned officers
pomponsand 16 January 1824 - on sewing coattails together,
adding a loop to the decorative right end of the shako cords, fitting the
knapsack chest strap so that it passed between the fourth and fifth coat
buttons as counted from the collar, were all applied to the Instructional
Sapper Battalion, which in 1824 began to wear taller shakos with wider shakos
cords than before (Illus. 2316) (181).
