Why an Armeniapedia?
Or to put it differently, what's the difference between Wikipedia and Armenia?  Here is some information Armeniapedia can and does have that Wikipedia guidelines do not allow.  Armenian recipes, entire books online, maps of Armenian sites in different parts of the world, articles about any Armenian in the world, information about visits to Armenia or quotes about Armenia(ns) by non-Armenians, book catalogs, courses on how to teach yourself Armenian, etc.  There's no limit to what can be added, other than it relating to Armenians!

Searching tip - If your search does not turn up results for an Armenian word, try spelling (transliterating) it differently.  For example, for Jermoog or Djermuk, try Jermuk, or for Ampert, try Amberd.  I generally use standardized  Eastern Armenian transliterations.  For spellings of peoples names, especially western Armenian there is no magic formula.  You can have Manugian, Manougian, Manoogian, Manukyan, Manoukyan, Manukian, etc.
About the articles - Articles about things Armenian should tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the subject, such as the duduk or Kirk Kerkorian.  Articles about things not Armenian are here only to give the Armenian angle, or connection.  The Bob Dole page will therefore only contain letters, references, information on his activities related to Armenian(ns).
