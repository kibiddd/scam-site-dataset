SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. is a leading international engineering and
construction firm with offices in more than 30 countries. Services offered
include engineering, construction, project management, procurement, and
financing. In 1991, SNC Group acquired its main rival, Lavalin Inc., which
had collapsed after an overambitious diversification plan. The combined
company has continued to grow ever since. It has focused its
growth-by-acquisition strategy on international companies since the
mid-1990s. More than half of revenues come from outside Canada.
SNC Is Formed in 1911
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.'s origins date back to 1911, when Dr. Arthur
Surveyer opened an engineering office in Montreal. Surveyer specialized in
civil engineering and later diversified into industrial plant design.
In 1937, Emil Nenniger and Georges Chênevert became Surveyer's
partners. The partnership was renamed Surveyer, Nenniger &
Chênevert (SNC) in 1947.
Engineer Camille Dagenais joined Surveyer, Nenniger &
Chênevert in 1953, when it had 130 employees, and became partner six
years later. In 1965, he was named chairman and general manager. SNC was
incorporated as a limited company in 1966.
SNC worked on a number of noteworthy projects in the early 1960s,
including Manic 5 Dam in northern Quebec. According to company literature,
its first international job was building the Idukki power station in
Kerala, India, in 1963.
The policy of Quebec's government of relying on private sector
engineers helped foster the development of the province's
engineering firms, noted Britain's
Financial Times.
In the late 1960s, Dagenais later told the
Canadian Business Review,
Canada's engineering firms such as SNC began incorporating
procurement and construction services to better serve their overseas
customers. They also became proficient at arranging financing for major
infrastructure projects.
SNC Group grew aggressively by acquisition in the 1970s. It had revenues
of C$180 million in 1981. The company had ventured into the defense
segment the previous year by acquiring IVI Inc., which made smaller
caliber ammunition.
SNC Goes Public in 1986
SNC became a public company in 1986. By this time, the group's
defense business (made up of IVI, Canadian Arsenals, and Securiplex
Systems Inc.) was rivaling the traditional engineering and construction
activities in importance.
Half of SNC's revenues were now coming from abroad. Both SNC and
Lavalin thrived in francophone Africa (particularly Algeria in the case of
Lavalin). These projects were generally funded by international
development agencies.
To cope with the early 1980s slowdown in engineering services, SNC Group
pursued growth in the defense market. It
acquired artillery ammunition producer Canadian Arsenals Ltd. for C$92
million in 1986. This added more than C$100 million to SNC's annual
revenues. SNC also invested in diverse joint ventures, including a compact
disc plant (Americ Disc) and a natural gas supplier.
Lavalin Formed in 1936
Jean-Paul Lalonde and Romeo Valois of Montreal formed the Lavalin civil
engineering firm in 1936. This would become SNC's chief rival under
the direction of Bernard Lamarre, who joined Lavalin in 1952 after
marrying Louise Lalonde, daughter of one of the company's founders.
He had first learned the construction business while working for his
father, a contractor in rural Quebec. Lamarre became head of Lavalin in
1962. Under Lamarre, Lavalin extended its global reach, then greatly
diversified its range of activities.
The firm started by Lalonde and Valois became known as Lavalin Inc. by the
early 1970s. Major projects for Lavalin during the decade included the
James Bay hydroelectric plant (in collaboration with Bechtel of the United
States) and the roof of Montreal's Olympic Stadium.
Lavalin took over a number of firms, including Canada's Shawinigan
Engineering and Warnock Hersey and Europe's Lafarge Coppee. Lavalin
was the largest engineering firm in Canada by the mid-1980s, with revenues
of C$500 million in 1983. It had 5,700 employees at this point.
Lavalin Overreaches in the 1980s
However, as the international business became more competitive, Lavalin
looked to build petrochemical and manufacturing segments. In 1986, it
acquired an 85 percent interest in Urban Transportation Development Corp.
(UTDC) from the government of Ontario for C$50 million. UTDC was
eventually sold to Bombardier Inc. The group also bought a money-losing
petrochemical plant called Kemtec that was sold off as well.
Lavalin was already exporting C$300 million worth of manufactured goods a
year, according to Toronto's
Financial Post.
Lavalin even acquired Montreal's Bellechasse hospital and
attempted to enter the aircraft leasing business. Other disparate new
purchases included Quebec's MeteoMedia television weather channel,
the book publisher Mondia, and real estate, including a new 55-floor
headquarters building. At the dawn of the 1990s, Lavalin was a C$1.2
billion conglomerate of more than 70 companies, but it was on the verge of
collapse due to its overly ambitious expansion into loss-making side
ventures. In 1991, Lavalin's bankers put it under pressure to be
acquired by its chief rival, SNC.
SNC Acquires Lavalin in 1991
SNC Group Inc. bought Lavalin Inc., the Lavalin Group's C$400
million ($348 million) engineering business, in August 1991. The combined
group, dubbed SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., was led by SNC chairman Guy
Saint-Pierre, who had steered the group through a turnaround in the
previous two years. (SNC posted a profit of C$23 million on revenues of
C$447 million in 1990.)
SNC-Lavalin was the fifth-largest engineering firm in the world, according
to one estimate. It had more than 7,000 employees after the merger but cut
2,000 jobs in the next two years. The two had markedly different cultures,
with Lalonde's autocratic style contrasting with the publicly
traded and largely employee-owned SNC.
In the mid-1990s, Saint-Pierre pursued growth abroad via acquisitions,
hiring more local talent than had traditionally been the case among
Canada's international engineering firms, noted the
Financial Post.
Saint-Pierre stepped down as CEO of SNCLavalin Group in 1996, a couple of
years after being named CEO of the Year by Toronto's
Financial Post.
He continued to work part-time as chairman. His successor as CEO was
Jacques Lamarre, brother of former Lavalin CEO Bernard Lamarre.
SNC-Lavalin acquired Kilborn Holdings Inc. in 1996. Based in Toronto,
Kilborn dated back to 1947 and specialized in engineering for uranium and
potash mining projects. It employed 1,200 people and had annual sales of
C$125 million.
In the 1990s, SNC-Lavalin partnered with Bombardier, Inc., the new owner
of the UTDC division, to develop transportation projects in Mayalsia
(Kuala Lumpur) and Turkey (Ankara) based on the automated SkyTrain system
that had proven successful in Vancouver.
The company bought a 27 percent share in Ontario's Highway 407 toll
road in 1999 for C$175 million. Part of this was sold off in 2002 at a
substantial profit. Other bright spots for 2002 included signing C$1
billion in thermal power-related contracts in the United States.
Company Perspectives:
Founded in 1911, SNC-Lavalin has been active internationally for
nearly 40 years, establishing a multicultural network that spans every
continent. The SNC-Lavalin companies have offices across Canada and in
30 other countries around the world and are currently working in some
100 countries.
SNC-Lavalin maintains exceptionally high standards for quality, health
and safety, and environmental protection, and is committed to
delivering projects on budget and on schedule to the complete
satisfaction of its clients. SNC-Lavalin's business strategy
rests on four strong pillars: Build on its recognized expertise in its
core sectors and develop new expertise in technical fields with
promising growth opportunities … Use its financing capabilities
to enhance its competitiveness in major projects … Use its
technical expertise and financial capabilities to develop and acquire
infrastructure concessions with solid fundamentals and potential
… Continue to leverage the international network it has built
up over nearly 40 years.
Still Acquisitive After 2000
SNC-Lavalin bought GDS Engineers, Inc., of Texas, a petrochemical industry
specialist, in early 2003. In 2003 and 2004, the group bolstered its
operations in France through a number of diversified acquisitions (Trouvin
S.A.S., Fimatec, Chovet Engineering S.A., Sogequip Groupe S.A.S.).
In 2003, SNC-Lavalin's revenues were more than C$3.3 billion ($2.5
billion); two-thirds was from outside Canada. Net income was C$86.5
million ($66.8 million). The company had 10,500 employees. In 2004, sales
rose to C$3.5 billion ($2.9 billion), 56 percent from outside Canada, as
net income reached C$104 million ($87.8 million).
In 2004, SNC-Lavalin bought out its partner in the Canatom NPM Inc.
nuclear engineering venture, which dated back to 1967. SNC-Lavalin
continued to look abroad for growth opportunities. In 2005, the company
acquired engineering and construction firm RJ Associates (Engineers) Pvt.
Ltd. of Mumbai, India.
