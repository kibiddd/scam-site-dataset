decades. The son of director Robert N. Bradbury, he appeared in vaudeville with
his parents and with his twin brother Bill Bradbury appeared as a child in a
series of 16 semi- documentary short films directed by their father,
The Adventures of Bob and Bill. As Bob Bradbury Jr., he played juvenile
roles in silent films, then took the stage name Bob Steele in 1927. He
appeared in scores of films during the Thirties, rising to B-Western
stardom and an apparently solid position as one of Republic Studios'
top draws. Occasionally he made an appearance in more prominent films,
as in his role as Curly in Of Mice and Men (1939). But he remained primarily a figure
in Westerns. His stardom diminished by the mid-40s, and he spent the
next quarter-century in character roles, some highly visible, such as
his part in The Big Sleep (1946). But he also eventually turned up as a virtual
extra in pictures like Shenandoah (1965). He appeared often on television and
regained some fame in his role as Trooper Duffy in F Troop (1965). He died at
St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, California, following a long
illness.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>The son of director Robert N. Bradbury, Bob Steele began his show-business career
early: he was part of his family's vaudeville act at age two, and
toured with them all over the West Coast. At age 14 he and his twin
brother Bill Bradbury made their film debuts in a series of comedy shorts
directed by their father, with Steele using his given name of Robert
Bradbury Jr. As he grew older he continued making films, many of them
westerns directed by his father, and it was in the 1927 western The Mojave Kid (1927)
that he first used the name "Bob Steele." Steele easily made the
transition from silents to talkies, and was soon starring in a series
of low-budget westerns for such independent studios such as Republic,
Supreme, Monogram and PRC. His short stature and scrappy nature were
things that many young western fans could identify with (and the fact
that most of the villains he beat up were much bigger than he was
didn't hurt, either), and his films were quite popular. Unlike many of
his western colleagues, however, Steele often ventured into other
genres, and gave acclaimed performances over the years, often playing
against his "good-guy" cowboy image in such classic films as Of Mice and Men (1939) -
in which he received some of the best reviews of his career as the
sadistic Curley - and The Big Sleep (1946), and he was especially memorable as a
cold-blooded mob triggerman in The Enforcer (1951). As Steele got older he became a
familiar face to TV fans as a guest star in many, if not most, of the
western series at the time, and at age 59 he landed the part he is best
known for: the aging but cantankerous Trooper Duffy, who at the drop of
a hat would began reminiscing about his fighting "shoulder to shoulder
with Davy Crockett at the Alamo" in the western comedy series F Troop (1965).
After a few more film appearances (including an impressive one as a
remorseful member of a lynching party in Hang 'Em High (1968)), Steele retired from
the screen in 1973. Bob Steele's long career, spanning more than 50
years and including appearances in more than 150 films, came to an end
in 1988, when he died after a lengthy illness.- IMDb Mini Biography By: frankfob2@yahoo.comFamilySpousesVirginia Nash Tatem(August 29, 1939 - December 21, 1988) (his death)Alice Petty Hackley(August 12, 1935 - July 12, 1938) (divorced)Louise A.
