MC Hammer Search Engine: WireDoo
“Do we really need another search? Of course not.” This is     the question and quick response MC Hammer delivered at the Web     2.0. Summit in San Francisco on Wednesday — but that hasn’t     stopped him from launching a new search engine of his own.

The ’90s rapper and online entrepreneur announced plans      WireDoo. Described as a “deep” or     “relationship” search, the service is currently in pre-beta     under Hammer’s Alchemist MMA.
So if we don’t need another search engine, why is Hammer     building one? “You can always make things better,” he said     onstage. “There’s always a next version.”

Hammer points to the rise of Google and the latest     iterations of Apple’s iPhone as his rationale for launching     another search. And Hammer does think WireDoo will fill a gap     in the market.
He explained that this particular method of searching will     connect keywords to related tropics. The more intuitive     platform has been in the works at Alchemist for over two     years.
Hammer is no stranger to the web. In 2008 he launched     DanceJam.com, a video sharing site for dancers, he develops     iPad apps and has investments in multiple online start-ups. He     even spoke about his second career during a February episode of     Oprah.
Web 2.0 has made Hammer’s full presentation available, but     it’s rather dry — and doesn’t even include a single verse of     “Addams Groove.”
