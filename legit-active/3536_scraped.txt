Ross Macdonald
Ross Macdonald is the main pseudonym that was used by the American-Canadian writer of crime fiction Kenneth Millar (/Ààm…™l…ôr/; December 13, 1915 ‚Äì July 11, 1983). He is best known for his series of hardboiled novels set in southern California and featuring private detective Lew Archer. Brought up in Ontario, he eventually settled in California, where he died in 1983.
Life
Millar was born in Los Gatos, California, and raised in his parents' native Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, where he started college.  When his father abandoned his family unexpectedly, Macdonald lived with his mother and various relatives, moving several times by his sixteenth year.
In Canada, he met and married Margaret Sturm in 1938. They had a daughter, Linda, who died in 1970. He began his career writing stories for pulp magazines. Millar attended the University of Michigan, where he earned a Phi Beta Kappa key and a PhD in literature.  While doing graduate study, he completed his first novel, The Dark Tunnel, in 1944. For his first four novels, he used his real name.  After serving at sea as a naval communications officer from 1944 to 1946, Millar returned to Michigan, where he obtained his PhD degree.

Here is another Musical Memory from W. Ross MacDonald school as we lead up to our 150th birthday celebration this May.
Gilbert and Sullivan Operettas were performed regularly at the school in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. The photo is the cast from the first production of HMS Pinafore in 1947, and the recording ‚ÄúI Am the Captain of the Pinafore‚Äù is from another one in 1955.

P-M William Ross's Farewell to the Scots Guards
Another one from City of Regina Pipe Band's very own Iain MacDonald, is a Boyd PC reed player! This one is a tune Iain recorded for a student, learning the tune. (Note the slower than usual tempo, for the purpose of playing along during practice)
Even slow, a great tune, and masterfully played as usual! Thanks for the clip Iain! I'm sure folks will appreciate it. I know I do! It's nice to hear a Boyd reed, being used regularly, by such a respected piper, as yourself! :)
You may find out about Iain, and all that he is involved in, in the Scottish piping world, as well as get expert advice on Scottish piping, and even find access to all the necessary tools needed, (Including Boyd PC Reeds!) to further your piping, or even get started on your own journey into the world of Scottish piping for the first time, right here: http://www.reelpipes.com/
