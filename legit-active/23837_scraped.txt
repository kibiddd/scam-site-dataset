Edwin Hawkins
Edwin Reuben Hawkins (born August 18, 1943, Oakland, California) is an American gospel musician, pianist, choir master, composer, and arranger. He is one of the originators of the urban contemporary gospel sound. He (as leader of the Edwin Hawkins Singers) is probably best known for his arrangement of "Oh Happy Day" (1968–69), which was included on the Songs of the Century list.  The Edwin Hawkins Singers made a second foray into the charts exactly one year later, backing folk singer Melanie on "Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)".
Biography
At the age of seven Hawkins was already the keyboardist to accompany the family's gospel choir. Together with Betty Watson, he was the co-founder of the Northern California State Youth Choir of the Church of God in Christ, which included almost fifty members.  This ensemble recorded its first album  Let Us Go into the House of the Lord at the Ephesian Church of God in Christ in Berkeley, California privately (on the Century 70 custom label), hoping to sell 500 copies.  "Oh Happy Day" was just one of the eight songs on the album.  (The soloists in the album were Elaine Kelly, Margarette Branch, Dorothy Combs Morrison, Tramaine Davis, Reuben Franklin, Donald Cashmere, Betty Watson, and Ruth Lyons.)

I Found The Answer
by: Edwin Hawkins
Verse 1I was weak and weary, I had gone astray,walking in the darkness, I couldn't find my way.Then a light came shining to lead me from despair,all my sins forgiven, and I was free from care.ChorusI found the answer, I learned to pray,*with faith to guide me, I found the way.The sun is shining for me each day,I found the answer, I learned to pray.Verse 2I was sad and lonely, all my hopes were gone,days were long and dreary, I couldn't carry on.Then I found the courage to keep my head up high,once again I'm happy, and here's the reason why.ChorusVerse 3Keep your Bible with you, read it every day,always count your blessings and always stop to pray.Learn to keep believing and faith will see you thro',seek to know contentment, and it will come to you.Chorus* additional note
