BiographyAwardsTriviaFAQIMDbProAll topicsEddie Foy(1856-1928)ActorSoundtrackIMDbProStarmeterSee rankAmerican stage actor, musical comedy star, and vaudevillian who was a
legendary figure of his time and who fathered a family of performers
who went on to notable careers in motion pictures. Born Edward
Fitzgerald at 23 8th Avenue in New York City, March 9, 1856, to an
Irish-immigrant tailor, Richard Fitzgerald, and his wife Mary, Eddie
moved to Chicago with his family after his father's death in an insane
asylum from syphilis in 1862. His mother reportedly cared for Mary Todd
Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's widow, during Mrs. Lincoln's mental illness.
At the age of 8, Eddie began entertaining on the street for tips, doing
acrobatic dances. He changed his name to Foy when he was 15, and he and
partner Jack Finnigan went on the road, dancing for meals in bars. They
got work as supernumeraries in dramatic productions and Foy claimed to
have worked in such a capacity with the leading actor of his day, Edwin
Booth. With another partner, Jim Thompson, Foy traveled for three years
in a saloon/theatre circuit through the West, including an extended
stay in Dodge City, Kansas, where he met Doc Holliday, 'William Barclay
'Bat' Masterson', and
Wyatt Earp. Also on the circuit
was a girl singer act, the Howland Sisters. Eddie fell for one of them,
Rose Howland, and they married in 1879. In 1882, the four (Thompson had
married another singer) returned East, joining the Carncross Minstrels
in Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter, however, Rose Foy and her newborn
died in childbirth. By 1887, Foy was back in the West, touring with
David Henderson's troupe across the country. He met Lola Sefton in San
Francisco and they were a couple for the next decade until her death.
(Many sources described them as husband and wife, though no record of a
marriage has been found.) After Sefton's death, Foy started his own
company and two years later married one of his dancers, Madeline
Morando. She gave him eleven children, the seven surviving ones
becoming world-famous in their father's act as The Seven Little Foys.
In 1903, while playing the Iroquois Theatre, Foy heroically
attempted to calm the crowd after fire broke out. Six hundred people
died. Foy escaped by crawling
through a sewer. Three years after bringing his children into the act,
Foy and his family appeared in a film for
Mack Sennett, one of only a handful the
senior Foy would do. However, his children, in particular
Bryan Foy and
Eddie Foy Jr., would enjoy substantial
careers in the movies. Eddie Sr. continued to headline in vaudeville
and musical theatre until his death from a heart attack in 1928 while
performing in vaudeville in Kansas City, Missouri.BornMarch 9, 1856DiedFebruary 16, 1928(71)BornMarch 9, 1856DiedFebruary 16, 1928(71)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
