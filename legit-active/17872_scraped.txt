Frequently asked questions
How do customers get early access to Alexa+?
We will start rolling out early access to US customers who own or purchase an Echo Show 8, 10, 15, or 21. Customers will be notified via email and through device notifications once access is granted. Once you have access and opt-in, Alexa+ will start working across all your compatible Echo devices, Fire TV and Fire tablets, as well as on your web browser and the Alexa app.
What devices can customers use Alexa+ on?
When you get access to Alexa+ by owning or purchasing an Echo Show 8, 10, 15, or 21, it will be available on all Echo devices, with the exception of certain older generation Echo devices like Echo Dot 1st Gen, Echo 1st Gen, Echo Plus 1st Gen, Amazon Tap, Echo Show 1st Gen, Echo Show 2nd Gen, and Echo Spot 1st Gen, where you can continue to use the original Alexa. You'll also be able to try Alexa+ on your web browser, the Alexa app, compatible Fire TVs, and Fire tablets. This experience is not currently supported on Alexa Built-in devices and Amazon Astro, however we look forward to expanding Alexa+ to additional devices in the future.
What languages is Alexa+ available in?
Alexa+ is currently only available in English for customers in the US. Device language must be set to “English United States.” To change your language settings, go to the Alexa app, or on-device by going to Settings > Device options > Device Language.
Can my child access Alexa+ on their Kids Edition Echo devices?
Yes. Alexa+ is an assistant for the whole family. Parents can make the Alexa+ Kids experience available to their kids on their Kids Edition Echo devices or by creating and enabling a child profile. Parents can set up a device to run Alexa+ Kids exclusively, or, if the device is shared by members of the household, parents can also set up a voice ID for their kids, so the device will turn on Alexa+ Kids when an enrolled child is recognized. When an enrolled child profile is recognized or on a device with Amazon Kids enabled, our GenAI content moderation extends the multi-layered controls for a general audience with additional guardrails that are purpose-built for children.
Will Amazon Kids+ work with Alexa+?
Alexa+ is compatible with Amazon Kids+. With Alexa+ and an Amazon Kids+ subscription, you'll have access to new Amazon Kids+ features like Stories with Alexa and Explore with Alexa. If you don't already have Amazon Kids+ and are eligible for a free trial, you can try Amazon Kids+ for free for 1-month during Alexa+ early access.
Will I be automatically charged for Alexa+ after the early access?
Alexa+ will be free during early access. After early access ends, you will not be automatically charged and Alexa+ will be a free benefit with your Prime membership. For non-Prime customers, you can sign up for Alexa+ for $19.99/month.
Will the original Alexa still be available?
Absolutely. While we're positive you'll love all that Alexa+ has to offer—greater intelligence, more natural conversation, and a brilliant array of new, proactive capabilities—the original Alexa will remain available to you on your devices.
