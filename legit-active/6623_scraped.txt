Metro Station Jean-drapeau
After we walked through the tunnel and emerged at station Jean-Drapeau, there was no one there to tell us what was going on, and no one to tell us if busses were on the way. Check the map; during the day this is a lively and beautiful urban park. At 7:00 PM in October it's the middle of nowhere. There isn't even a street within eyeshot.  If you look really hard, you can see the Bucky Ball (the Biosphere) behind the metro station.
