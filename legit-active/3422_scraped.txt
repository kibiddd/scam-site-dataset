Listen while you read!
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Baby, hold it and let me holla at you, baby for a moment
And if you with it, I'm with it, we'll keep it rollin'
And we'll be dancing and drinking until the morning
Until the morning
Sparks going off
It's so hot there's girls just taking all their clothes off
So take a picture of this moment with your iPhone
'Cause I don't wanna forget tonight, night, night
Put your lighters in the air
Let 'em burn into the night
And let everybody know
That you're with it and you're ready to go
So hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight
So hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights
Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way, way, way
'Cause it's hot in the club now do don't let it stop now
So hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights
And everybody say oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
All them bitches think they fly
And all 'em bitches flew to me
Hit the lights so you could see
My drink is strong and my hooka sweet
Understand the time is now
But time is up, the future's bleak
It's me, it's stupid cupid
Love me, leave me in the morning
If you like, your friend can join in
The wildest flower in the garden
Coolest nigga in the party
Shades on, dreads long
Blood gang, red zone
And I'm with Jay Sean
Put ya lighters in the air
Let 'em burn into the sky
And let everybody know
That you're with it and you're ready to go
So hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight
So hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights
Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way, way, way
'Cause it's hot in the club now do don't let it stop now
So hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights
And everybody say
Turn 'em low, turn 'em high
Light it up to the sky
Turn 'em low, turn 'em high
Light it up to the sky
And everybody say oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights tonight, tonight
So hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, oh, oh, oh
Hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights
Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way, way, way
'Cause it's hot in the club now do don't let it stop now
So hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights
Hit the lights
