I'd never heard of this film. The cast, Lauren Bacall Richard Chamberlain and Mare Winningham, is what got my attention. They were all amazing here. The story, about tobacco heiress Doris Duke, was very well made. The acting, direction, and writing were all top notch. The miniseries, shown on CBS in 1999, holds up well in 2021. It's a sad tale, covering Ms. Duke's turbulent life: her relationship with her mother and father, her marriages, her adoption, and her relationship with her butler. Though I believe many liberties were taken with the script, this was very well written. The leads do a very good coveting Ms Duke and her butler Bernard. You route for Ms. Duke, and you hate the scheming Bernard. All and all, a very good 2 part miniseries. Thanks TUBI for making these old TV movies available.james_thompson-97986Jan 22, 2021PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ17How many seasons does Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke have?Powered by AlexaWhere is this available?DetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 22, 1999 (United States)Countries of originUnited StatesCanadaLanguageEnglishAlso known asRevers de fortuneFilming locationsHawaii, USAProduction companiesBernard Sofronski ProductionsStephanie Germain ProductionsVon Zerneck-Sertner FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime2 hours 50 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Too Rich: the secret life of Doris Duke (1999) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
