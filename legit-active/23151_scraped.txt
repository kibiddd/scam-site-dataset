DEAD-Y GOOD TIMES IN ILLINOIS  Tom Constanten  On August 26 and 27th, 2011 the Field Trip Festival at Vasa Park in South Elgin, IL will be highlighted by the first ever live concert performance of both Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten and JGB organist Melvin Seals.  The two will perform on August 27th headlining the festival with Chicago’s Terrapin Flyer.  Both keyboardists are looking forward to the opportunity of performing with each other and have great respect for one another.  It should make for a potent combination as the two will be leaving their comfort zones by performing both JGB and Grateful Dead classics during the 3 hour set.  Both Constanten and Seals have performed for the past 6 years with Terrapin Flyer for regional tours, but this will be the first billed performance of both together in any capacity.  In addition to Seals and TC, the performance on the 27th will also feature the bassist of the current incarnation of the JGB Jimmy Tebeau and one time Cornmeal guitarist Erik Smith.  The festival occurs on and gets its namesake from the 39th anniversary of the legendary Springfield Creamery benefit on Ken Kesey’s farm that the Grateful Dead performed at in 1972.  It is in its second year and last year reunited Dose Hermanos (Tom Constanten & Bob Bralove) for their first performance in many years.  The event was well attended last year, but is not your typical macro-fest.  The event grounds have a capacity of 1500, so it is an intimate gathering that includes overnight camping on Friday and Saturday nights for the $45 presale tickets.  The event will also include performances by the popular Chicago based band Mr. Blotto, who recorded a CD with Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow.  Supporting the headliners are the nationally touring bluegrass band the Henhouse Prowlers, who won first place in the RockyGrass band competition in Colorado, and Wisconsin jambandeers Cosmic Railroad.  Also, included in the fest are a number of other diversely influenced bands from around the region performing on two stages.
