These place names derive from the Old English terms "fu-l," meaning "dirty," or "muddy," and "ford," meaning "a ford," a shallow place where a river could be crossed. 1Loading... Early Origins of the Fulford familyThe surname Fulford was first found in Devon where the earliest on record was William de Fulford, who held the manor of Great Fulford, in county Devon, near Exeter, during the reign of King Richard I (1189-1199.) 2 "The Fulfords of Fulford, in the parish of Dunsford, are a very ancient and distinguished Devonshire knightly family, dating back to the 12th century." 3However, "there is every reason to believe that the ancestors of the venerable family have resided at Fulford from the time of the Conquest. Three knights of the house distinguished themselves in the wars of the Holy Land. " 2 Indeed, the place name Fulford dates back to at least the Domesday Book where Fuleford spelling was listed in Yorkshire and Staffordshire at that time. The earliest listing for Somerset was found in 1327 as Fuleforde. 4"One of the estates held by these thanes is Filauefford ; so that there is good evidence in 1086 that the Saxon owners of Great Fulford had not been dispossessed ; while the parent stock of Fulfords were certainly there within a century. The other Foleford of ' Domesday,' held by Motbert under Baldwin the Sheriff, was a small manor, identifiable with Little Fulford in Shobrooke. Be all this as it may, among the most distinguished Crusaders of the West were Sir William, Sir Baldwin, and Sir Armas de Fulford. In the Wars of the Roses the Fulfords took the Lancastrian side ; and Sir Baldwin, who fought at Towton, was beheaded at Hexham, in 1461. But the family remained true, and his son, Sir Thomas, was attainted for espousing the cause of the Earl of Richmond, in 1483. He also took part in the relief of Exeter, when it was besieged by Perkin Warbeck, in 1497. The forfeiture only lasted a couple of years. In the Wars of the Commonwealth, as was to be expected, the Fulfords were staunch Royalists ; and Colonel, subsequently Sir Francis, Fulford made Fulford a royal garrison. His son Thomas was killed in the service ; and in December, 1645, the house was taken by Fairfax, and placed under the command of Colonel Okey. The mansion is, in the main, Elizabethan, and contains a royal recognition of the family loyalty in a portrait of Charles I. " 5Loading...

Fulford migration to Canada +A great wave of immigration to the New World was the result of the enormous political and religious disarray that struck England at that time. Families left for the New World in extremely large numbers. The long journey was the end of many immigrants and many more arrived sick and starving. Still, those who made it were rewarded with an opportunity far greater than they had known at home in England. These emigrant families went on to make significant contributions to these emerging colonies in which they settled.

Fulford migration to West Indies +The British first settled the British West Indies around 1604. They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 13Fulford Settlers in West Indies in the 17th CenturyJoe Fulford who settled in St. Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635Jo Fulford, aged 18, who arrived in Barbados in 1635 8Mr. John Fulford, (b. 1617), aged 18, British settler traveling aboard the ship "Matthew" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 14 Contemporary Notables of the name Fulford (post 1700) +Robert Marshall Blount Fulford OC (1932-2024), Canadian author, journalist, broadcaster, and editor, known for his weekly columns for the Financial Times of Canada (1988–1992), The Globe and Mail (1992–1999) and the National Post (1999–2019)Francis Fulford (1803-1868), Canadian (English born), Anglican prelate, the first bishop of Montreal, Canada (1850-1868) 15George Taylor Fulford (1852-1905), Canadian businessman and politician, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament for Leeds (1934-1937)Michael Gordon Fulford CBE, FBA, (b. 1948), English Professor of Archaeology at the University of ReadingSir Roger Thomas Baldwin Fulford CVO (1902-1983), English journalist, historian, writer and politicianCarlton W.

The Fulford Motto +The motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.
