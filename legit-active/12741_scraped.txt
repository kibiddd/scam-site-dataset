Avishai Cohen - Trumpet
Biography

Has Influenced
A year after his impressionistic, award winning and critically-lauded ECM debut Into The Silence, Avishai Cohen’s Cross My Palm With Silver (May 5th, 2017) introduces a program of new pieces which put the focus on the ensemble, on teamwork, with an exceptional quartet featuring Yonathan Avishai (piano), Barak Mori (bass) and Nasheet Waits (drums). The adroit interplay among the musicians allows Avishai Cohen to soar, making it clear why the pure-toned trumpeter is one of the most talked-about jazz musicians on the contemporary scene.In 2016 alone, Cohen was named “Best Foreign Artist” by Jazz Magazine France, while Into the Silence was awarded “Best Album of the Year” by TSF Jazz and Academie du Jazz, and in the top 20 albums of the year by JazzTimes. For four years running, Cohen has been voted a Rising Star-Trumpet in the Down Beat Critics Poll. Along with leading his quartet, the trumpeter has led Triveni (a trio with Omer Avital and Nasheet Waits) for over a decade, was a member of the prestigious SFJAZZ Collective for six years, and has been a featured soloist in a number of special ensembles – most recently in “Jazz 100” alongside Danilo Perez, Lizz Wright, Chris Potter and Wycliffe Gordon. He also records and tours the world with The 3 Cohens Sextet, the hit family band with his sister, clarinetist-saxophonist Anat, and brother, saxophonist Yuval. Declared All About Jazz: “To the ranks of the Heaths of Philadelphia, the Joneses of Detroit and the Marsalises of New Orleans, fans can now add the 3 Cohens of Tel Aviv.”The trumpeter began performing in public in 1988 at age 10, playing his first solos with a big band and eventually touring with the Young Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra to perform under the likes of maestros Zubin Mehta, Kurt Masur and Kent Nagano. Having worked with Israeli folk and pop artists in his native country and appeared on television early on, Cohen arrived as an experienced professional musician when he took up a full scholarship at Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 1997, the young musician established an international reputation by placing third in the Thelonious Monk Jazz Trumpet Competition. Avishai came of age as a jazz player as part of the fertile scene at the club Smalls in New York’s West Village.Cohen first recorded for ECM as part of saxophonist Mark Turner’s quartet on Lathe of Heaven, released in September 2014. The trumpeter has performed at the Village Vanguard and beyond with Turner, as well as widely in a band led by pianist Kenny Werner. Cohen has played often in the Mingus Big Band and Mingus Dynasty ensemble, and he has lent his horn to recordings by Anat Cohen, Yuval Cohen and keyboardist Jason Lindner, along with collaborating on stage with French-Israeli pop singer Keren Ann, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Indian Tabla Master Zakir Hussain. In addition to performing, Cohen was named the Artistic Director of the International Jerusalem Festival in 2015.

As with Into The Silence, Cross My Palm With Silver was produced by Manfred Eicher at Studios La Buissonne in the south of France. It was released on the eve of a European tour, with concerts in France, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Great Britain, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands and followed by a worldwide tour in the Fall of 2017.

Avishai Cohen and Yonathan Avishai: Playing The Room
by Michael McKinney
December 16, 2019
Playing the Room, a record pairing New York-based trumpet player Avishai Cohen and Burgundy-based pianist Yonathan Avishai, is a restrained and joyous affair. Their playing glows with a quiet delight, as though the musicians were glad for the simple act of playing together. That rarely comes out in overt and loud celebration, however—this is not a record of fireworks. That much is clear from the start: “The Opening" starts the record off with a stately melody from Avishai; ...

Avishai Cohen: Cross My Palm With Silver
by Niccolò Lucarelli
May 9, 2017
Avishai Cohen, trombettista israeliano da anni stabilitosi a New York, è jazzista dalla profonda coscienza civile, sensibile alle problematiche politiche di Israele, la sua terra natale, così come degli Stati Uniti, suo Paese d'adozione. Cross My Palm with Silver, è un album dal fascino mistico, con quel titolo che sa d'invocazione alla divinità, di preparazione a un rito propiziatorio. Da sempre la musica è strumento di pace e di dialogo, e l'ultima fatica jazzistica di Cohen contiene riflessioni sull'assurdità dei ...

Avishai Cohen - Trumpet: Cross My Palm With Silver
by Karl Ackermann
April 28, 2017
If trumpeter Avishai Cohen's ECM debut, Into The Silence was a work of deeply personal content, Cross My Palm With Silver plays out with the same emotional impact, but on a global stage. Cohen composed the five pieces on this album in his native Israel, while contemplating the impact of political division on the human psyche. His hope is that the music contributes to a healing process. Returning from Into The Silence quintet is drummer Nasheet Waits, a ...

Avishai Cohen - Trumpet: Into the Silence
by Karl Ackermann
February 14, 2016
Israeli-born trumpeter and prodigy Avishai Cohen was already touring with the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra as a teenager. He attended Berklee College of Music, and later, placed highly in the Thelonious Monk jazz trumpet competition. A progressive-thinking artist, he hasn't looked back musically. With his highly regarded group, Triveni, Cohen challenged his own resourcefulness and creative process in a trio without a chordal instrument. ECM Records founder, Manfred Eicher, had taken note of Cohen's performance and unique sound on ...

Avishai Cohen - Trumpet: Into the Silence
by Mark Sullivan
February 5, 2016
Trumpeter Avishai Cohen makes his ECM leader debut with Into the Silence, an album dedicated to the memory of his late father. Cohen composed the melodies over six months following his father's passing in November 2014, inspired by an album of Rachmaninoff's solo piano music. It's not always sad music--this is not a collection of dirges--but it does maintain a contemplative mood throughout. Cohen says “The title of the song and album refers to the silence of absence, the way ...

Avishai Cohen - After the Big Rain (2007)

Something Else!
September 19, 2011
Reviewers sometimes get too caught up playing the label game: jazz, pop, world (ah, the ambiguous catch-all label), rock, ambient. Whenever a writer struggles with material that lacks a definite musical anchor, I am reminded of the transformation seen through Miles Davis' electric years. Squeaky horns, abusive guitars, fuzzed-out keyboards, all woven together with constantly shifting, obscenely polyrhythmic percussion. It was jazz, pop, rock, ambient, and a handful of other things. Forget the category, nothing sounded like this. Trumpeter Avishai ...
