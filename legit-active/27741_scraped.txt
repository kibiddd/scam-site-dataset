Welcome to
RWJBarnabas Health
With the safety of our patients and team members at the forefront, we are
taking the appropriate precautions and using best practices to continue
to ensure the highest quality care, protection, support and comfort for
all of our patients.
Our dedication to serving the people of New Jersey extends far beyond the
care we provide within our hospital walls. We support programs that promote
health and wellness in our communities and provide access to services
that would otherwise be unavailable. We are committed to the ongoing improvement
of the health, quality of life and vitality of our communities. We strive
to bring the best health care to meet the evolving needs of residents
in New Jersey — whether that be enhancing the coordination for treating
complex health conditions or improving community health through local
programs and education.
Mission, Vision And Values
The Largest Academic Health Care System in New Jersey
Our partnership with Rutgers University creates the state’s largest
academic health care system dedicated to providing high-quality patient
care, leading-edge research, and world-class health and medical education,
further advancing our mission of providing high-quality health care in
New Jersey.
The collaboration also aligns RWJBarnabas Health with Rutgers’ education,
research and clinical activities, including those at the Rutgers Cancer
Institute and Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care.
