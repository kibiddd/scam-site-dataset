Seychelle: "I know it’s a hassle, but reading the fine print is underrated...
Caret Down Icon
"I know it’s a hassle, but reading the fine print is underrated. Know what fees, APRs and benefits you’re signing up for. You might uncover extra value from features that aren’t advertised or discover some nasty fees to avoid. When you know what the terms are, it’s easier to get the most from your cards and avoid pitfalls."
Katie: "Credit card rewards, welcome bonuses and...
Caret Down Icon
"Credit card rewards, welcome bonuses and added perks — like travel insurance or savings on certain brands — are essentially free money. By swiping a card for everyday purchases, you can earn rewards toward your next trip or cash in your wallet. Pay your balance on time and in full to avoid interest fees and credit dings."
Ana: "I think the best habit is to treat your credit card like a debit card...
Caret Down Icon
"I think the best habit is to treat your credit card like a debit card. Don’t spend more money than you can easily pull from your checking account. If you can’t pay off a purchase within a couple of weeks, you can’t afford it. This practice can help you avoid credit card debt — and expensive interest charges."
Ted: "There’s a saying that credit cards are like power tools...
Caret Down Icon
"There’s a saying that credit cards are like power tools. As in, really useful or dangerous. It’s all about how you use them. Half of cardholders pay in full every month and benefit from rewards and buyer protections. The other half can get trapped in an expensive debt cycle. Pay in full and get credit cards working for you."

How we make money
Bankrate.com is an independent, advertising-supported publisher and comparison service. We are compensated in exchange for placement of sponsored products and services, or by you clicking on certain links posted on our site. Therefore, this compensation may impact how, where and in what order products appear within listing categories, except where prohibited by law for our mortgage, home equity and other home lending products. Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
