Monopoly (game)
Monopoly is a  board game that originated in the United States in 1903 as a way to demonstrate that an economy which rewards wealth creation is better than one in which monopolists work under few constraints and to promote the economic theories of Henry George and in particular his ideas about taxation and women’s rights. The current version was first published by Parker Brothers in 1935. Subtitled "The Fast-Dealing Property Trading Game", the game is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity. It is now produced by the United States game and toy company Hasbro. Players move around the gameboard buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels, and collecting rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them all into bankruptcy leaving one monopolist in control of the entire economy. Since the board game was first commercially sold in the 1930s, it has become a part of popular world culture, having been locally licensed in more than 103 countries and printed in more than 37 languages.

Here & Now (band)
Here & Now are an English psychedelic/space rock band formed in early 1974. They have close connections with the band Gong and in 1977/1978 worked with Gong's Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth under the name Planet Gong.
Guitarist Steffy Sharpstrings' highly individual sound was influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Both Steffy and bassist Keith the Bass have featured in later incarnations of Gong.
History
The first version of the group was co-founded in London by drummer/vocalist Keith Dobson later known as "Kif Kif Le Batter", guitarist/keyboardist José Gross, bassist Franco & others in March, 1974. They were known for jamming (free improvisation), which they did exclusively. The name was made up by Keith and Franco and inspired by the book Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass. Keith, José, violinist Chris Kellaher & guitarist  Jol Buchanan had been jamming together since 1973 in an apartment at 30 Hedgegate Court, Powys Terrace off Portobello Road, London. Their unpopularity with other residents in the block who had a habit of throwing mattresses and bricks at their window meant that they could not stay so they moved to a squat in for the first time in  Norburn Street, W10 off Ladbroke Grove in early 1974 when they teamed up with Franco. They believed in the purity of creating music "in the moment" and didn't have rehearsals or songs. No-one ever paid to see or hear them either, as they would only play their music at free shows and free festivals.

Here & Now (America album)
Here & Now is the sixteenth original studio album by American folk rock duo America, released by Burgundy Records in January 2007 (see 2007 in music). This is the first pop music studio album released by the group since Human Nature in 1998 (the group released a Christmas-themed studio album in 2002, Holiday Harmony).  This album was a modest hit when it was released in 2007, reaching 52 on the Billboard album chart; America's best chart showing since 1982's View from the Ground.
History
The personnel involved in the recording and production of Here & Now departs sharply from previous projects and represents an effort to reconnect with fresh, young talent. The album is co-produced by James Iha (formerly of Smashing Pumpkins) and Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne and Ivy). Guest artists include Ryan Adams, Ben Kweller, Jim James and Patrick Hallahan of My Morning Jacket, Matthew Caws and Ira Elliot of Nada Surf, Mark Rozzo of Maplewood, and longtime collaborator and friend Stephen Bishop. Veteran America drummer Will Leacox joins in on percussion. Cover songs include "Indian Summer" (Maplewood), "Golden" (My Morning Jacket), and "Always Love" (Nada Surf).
