I am truly impressed with Service Express's customer service and knowledge. They explained everything in detail and answered all my questions. When there were things they could not help us with, they offered comparable options. They were very flexible on giving us time and working with us as we re-did the things we were needing. They were very patient with us throughout the whole process.”(read more)

Service Express has made it easier for us to keep our legacy hardware past the OEM support contract. When it comes time to renew most of our purchases we usually check first with Service Express to see if they can cover it. Once implemented, we have found their engineers and inventory more than adequate to meet our day to day needs for support.”(read more)

The transition to ServiceExpress was seamless. Once everything was onboarded, support continued as it should with no interruptions. Service delivery has been top notch, with minimal extensions past SLAs. The account team has been upfront with any issues that developed and track down the root cause and made corrections to make sure there was a low likelihood of a similar instance occurring. I highly recommend them for Third-Party maintenance.”(read more)
