Deutsche ‘Mayday!’
By

Jurors at the Deutsche Bank Building manslaughter trial yesterday heard audio of some of the frantic radio dispatches from the 2007 blaze that left two firefighters dead from smoke inhalation.
“We’re getting no water on 15,” says one firefighter.
“Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!” cries a member of Engine 10.
“It’s banked down and starting to get hot. We’re on 15, outside the elevators with a number of members trying to find the B stairwell, to evacuate.”
Then the call comes again: “Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”
Mitchel Alvo, Salvatore DePaola and Jeffrey Melofchik are accused of neglecting a broken basement standpipe that should have been available to relay water to firefighters on the upper floors.
Firefighters Robert Beddia and Joseph Graffagnino became trapped on the 14th floor, and died of smoke inhalation after their oxygen ran out.
