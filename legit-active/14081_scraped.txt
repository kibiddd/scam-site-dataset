A Family Owned and Operated Farm
The Rahm's have owned & operated Forrest Green Farm for 31 years!
Regenerative 423 Acre Farm
We take pride in our farming practices and use terms like "Regenerative Agriculture" and "Beyond Organic" to describe them. Our aim is to improve the land and not harm it.  While we aren't certified organic, we hold ourselves to standards that we consider to be well beyond organic.
100% Grass-fed & Finished Beef and Pasture Raised Chickens & Eggs
Our commitment to sustainable and regenerative farming practices means that we don't use any harmful pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, GMOs, synthetic fertilizers, or fillers on our land or with our animals. We believe in the importance of treating our animals with care and respect, as they are an integral part of our holistic approach to farming. By nurturing the health and wellbeing of our animals and our land, we are able to provide our customers with the highest quality, nutrient-dense food and products possible.
Plant Nursery
At our farm, we take pride in growing a wide range of seasonal plant starts. Our focus is on cultivating culinary and medicinal herbs, natives, and heirloom vegetables & flowers. To ensure the highest quality, we use a specially formulated soil mix that we personally mix by hand. Plus, we never use pesticides, herbicides, or chemicals on our plants. We only purchase organic seeds from companies that sign the Safe Seed Pledge. Additionally, we bring in a selection of larger landscape plants, perennials, and fruit plants from local growers. We strive to provide our customers with the healthiest and most sustainable plants.
