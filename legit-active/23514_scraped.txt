I feel like there is a lot of information and encouragement for people who are considering making a move or taking an extended trip from the country where they grew up. I really enjoy hearing details on how people are making their new lives work and how they adjust to different cultures. But I also like the more “pure travel” sections that are less about relocating and more information on an exotic travel destination. It’s a good mix. Thanks for turning out an interesting read month after month!”Bess KExpat StoriesReal-life stories from people, just like you, who have made the move overseas.
