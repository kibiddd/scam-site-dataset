Cosos Range - Little Petroglyph Canyon  The Cosos lie within the confines of China Lake Naval Weapons Center (NWC), the U.S. Navy's largest research and development facility, making it a little difficult to arrange a visit. Let DesertUSA show you this little-viewed canyon that contains as many as 100,000 drawings, some thought to be 10,000 years old.
Carlsbad Caverns  The park's most famous cave, Carlsbad Cavern, is over 1,000 feet deep and currently contains 30 miles of mapped passages. The Big Room of Carlsbad Cavern is the largest underground chamber in the United States. View formations of stalagmites, stalactites, and columns in this video. You will also see the evening flight of Mexican free-tailed bats from the entrance of the Cavern.
