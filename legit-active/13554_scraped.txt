_____________________________________
Dear families and staff,
The Alabama State Department of Education ("ALSDE") informed school districts across the state, including our school system, of a recent cybersecurity incident involving PowerSchool. PowerSchool is ALSDE's third-party software provider for housing student information.
PowerSchool recently experienced a targeted attack, which impacts several school districts both domestically and internationally. It is important to note that this incident did not directly target ALSDE or our district.
We have been advised that accessed information may include names, addresses, student ID numbers, and email addresses of students and staff members. However, it is our understanding that no student's or employee's social security number was accessed, and no employee bank account information was accessed.
PowerSchool reports the incident is contained, and that there is no evidence of ongoing unauthorized activity or operational disruptions. They have implemented enhanced security measures, deactivated the compromised credentials, and continue to monitor the situation closely. If we receive additional updates about this incident, we will share that with our school community.
