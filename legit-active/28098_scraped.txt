History and Mission of Animal Advocates
Animal Advocates is a nonprofit, all volunteer, Pittsburgh-based animal welfare organization involved in the rescue, care and placement of companion animals. Serving the Pittsburgh area since 1984, Animal Advocates has adhered to a no-kill policy and engaged in community based advocacy on behalf of animals since its inception.
We aim to provide high quality care for the well-being of rescued cats and dogs until they are placed in forever homes.
Except for a limited number of cats fostered at our headquarters, our adoptable animals are cared for in loving volunteer foster homes.
We get to know the pets’ personalities and needs very well, striving to make the best possible match for both animals and adopters.
We believe the relationship between a human and companion animal is an important bond that improves the physical and social well-being of individuals and the community at large.
