Press Releases
DiBella Entertainment has signed Brentwood, New York‚Äôs James ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù McGirt, Jr. (12-0, 7 KO‚Äôs), son of the legendary former World Champion and current top trainer Buddy McGirt, Sr., to an exclusive promotional agreement, it was announced today by DBE president Lou DiBella.
‚ÄúI followed James‚Äô career and believe he‚Äôs one of the top prospects in the middle weight divisions.  Under the tutelage of his dad Buddy McGirt, one of the best trainers in the game, James Jr. has a bright future as a DBE fighter.  We can‚Äôt wait for his Broadway Boxing debut on December 14,‚Äù said Lou DiBella, President of DiBella Entertainment.
McGirt, Jr., the undefeated Long Island native, will see action in an eight-round middleweight affair, one of four featured attractions on the double show, season finale of Broadway Boxing Presented by StubHub on Thursday night, December 14th, at the Grand Ballroom at the Manhattan Center.
Brooklyn‚Äôs Sechew ‚ÄúIron Horse‚Äù Powell (20-1, 12 KO‚Äôs) will be featured in a 10-round junior middleweight attraction with Dash-DiBella Promotion‚Äôs Gary ‚ÄúKid‚Äù Stark, Jr. (17-0, 8 KO‚Äôs) of Staten Island appearing in 10-round junior featherweight battle.
McGirt, the flashy southpaw and rising star, comes into the bout undefeated with five of his last six victories coming by way of TKO. Most recently, he scored an impressive decision victory over fellow ‚Äúson of a legend‚Äù Stephon Pryor (son of Aaron) in a bout televised by Showtime‚Äôs ShoBox. He looks to continue his rise on December 14th when he makes his Broadway Boxing debut.
Brooklyn‚Äôs Powell, who had reeled off 20 straight wins during his pro career, will try to get back on the winning track following his first professional setback to Former World Champion Kassim Ouma in August at Madison Square Garden in a bout that was televised by HBO. Powell returns too the Broadway Boxing stage under the tutelage of his new stablemate‚Äôs father, Buddy McGirt, Sr.
Continuing his impressive Broadway Boxing run, Staten Island native Gary ‚ÄúKid‚Äù Stark, Jr. (17-0, 8 KO‚Äôs) will see action for the eighth time in the friendly confines of the Manhattan Center. Coming off of a dominant and near shutout performance over Carlos Diaz on September 20th in the Hammerstein Ballroom, ‚ÄúKid‚Äù will look to continue his rise up the junior featherweight rankings in a ten round bout and show why he is considered one of the most promising and talented prospects in New York City.
A fourth featured bout that will be televised as part of the two Broadway Boxing shows that will be taped on December 14th will be announced shortly.
Undefeated local standouts Juan Cabrera (5-0, 4 KO‚Äôs) of Manhattan by way of Santo Domingo, Maureen Shea (7-0, 3 KO‚Äôs) of the Bronx, Robert Semidei (1-0) of Brooklyn and first time pro Eusebio Flores of Queens via Mexico City will also appear on the New York-stacked fight card featuring fighters from every borough in the city. Also appearing will be Atlantic City‚Äôs Patrick Majewski (1-0, 1 KO) who will look to repeat on his September 20th Broadway Boxing knockout performance in a four round middleweight affair.
The two editions of Broadway Boxing will air on a later date in high definition exclusively on HDNet and in over 30 million homes on SportsNet New York in the New York Metropolitan Area, Comcast SportsNet Chicago, Comcast SportsNet Southeast, Comcast SportsNet West and Comcast Local √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Detroit. Broadway Boxing is sponsored by StubHub, HBO Sports, the motion picture Rocky Balboa and Gallagher‚Äôs Steak House.
The excitement of Broadway Boxing‚Äôs fights and the electricity of the crowds at the Manhattan Center have drawn the likes of celebrities and athletes such as Jay Z., Hilary Swank, Rosario Dawson, Fat Joe, Camron, Wladimir Klitschko, Lennox Lewis, Jermain Taylor, Ricky Hatton, Tiki Barber and Tracy McGrady to name a few.
Tickets priced at $152, $102, $82, $62, and $42 for standing room only are available by calling DiBella Entertainment at 212-947-2577. Tickets for Broadway Boxing are also available online exclusively through StubHub at http://www.stubhub.com/boxing.
