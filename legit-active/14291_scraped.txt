Struggling artist Sonny Malone (Michael Beck) is trapped in a dull job painting album covers. He is instantly attracted to Kira (Olivia Newton-John), an anonymous woman randomly photographed in the background of one of his assignments, but no one is able to identify her. Visiting the auditorium where the cover was shot, Sonny finds the mysterious beauty, an ageless Greek muse, who encourages him to team up with old-fashioned Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) to build a roller-skating disco.

Xanadu
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Not even spandex and over-the-top musical numbers can save Xanadu from questionable acting, unimpressive effects, and a story unencumbered by logic.

"Xanadu" cannot possibly be described as a good movie, but it can be recommended to those who can tolerate large amounts of intravenous marzipan.

Empire Magazine
This modern musical with tunes written by Where Are They Now pop band ELO falls flat on its face simply because the premise is so utterly ludicrous.
Rated: 2/5

The acting is wooden, the direction and cinematography confused, the special effects largely out of place, the dramatic interest nonexistent.

The Film Yap
The much-pilloried roller disco musical went on to become a Broadway hit and cult classic, and upon further reconsideration... still deserves its reputation as an all-time dud.

Alternate Ending
It is one of the dumbest movies of the 1980s, and one of the most joyful movies of the 1980s.

â€¦This may not be Xanadu as Orson Welles or Coleridge imagined it, but it youâ€™re looking for a gaudy pleasuredome with Gene Kelly dancinâ€™ to ELO, youâ€™re absolutely welcome to this oneâ€¦

You can learn a lot from a bad film, one made with complete earnestness but fails so spectacularly that you can't help but enjoy it. Xanadu is very much one of those films, simultaneously existing as one of the dumbest yet most joyful films of the 80s, managing to trumpet the worst excesses of both the fading 70s disco craze and the burgeoning 80s New Wave scene. It's engagingly surrealistic in a pop-glitter way sort of way. The film is obviously meant to be a throwback to old-style Hollywood musicals, but unfortunately merely replaces style and substance with flash and glitz; not even the spandex and over-the-top musical numbers can save Xanadu from the questionable acting, confused direction and photography, hilarious low brow special effects and story completely unencumbered by logic. Granted, there are a few saving graces sprinkled throughout, the Don Bluth animated sequence is incredible, Gene Kelly is giving it his all in a role that doesn't demand a lot but one he still commits 100% to and, honestly, I dug the music a lot. Xanadu strives mightily to achieve magic, but for all its sunbeams, mirages and tricky dissolves, it remains mostly humourless and a choreographer's worst nightmare. Total confection and 100% ridiculous in all its mindboggling awfulness.

Colorful, feel good, campy movie with terrific songs,  Courtesy mostly to Jeff Lynne of ELO ,  Eye catching Kenny Ortega roller skating, choregography, And nice seeing Gene Kelly in his final musical,  going out with class,  The entire movie's success belongs to Olivia Newton-John, So beautiful, so charming , so charismatic, so radiant, She literally lights up the screen.  It's too bad her miscast costar Michael Beck comes across as a wooden bore.

What most people miss is that this is a musical with an outstanding score. Musicals are not known for the dramatics. The dance numbers and the musical arrangement in this movie are outstanding.

Strange and terrible disco movie is only good for a few laughs... An album cover designer, Sonny, (Michael Beck); meets his muse Kira, (Olivia Newton John); who inspires him to resurrect an old nightclub as a roller disco.  (Once you drag "roller disco" into the plot description all credibility goes right out the window)..And the plot is just all over place, wildly incorporating different story elements, like roller skating, with Greek Mythology, with disco, with ancient Chinese mythology, with the LA nightlife scene, with disco, with poems from Samuel Taylor Coleridge; with jazz-punk fusion, with disco, with WW2 war stories; with fantasy stories about spirits in the material world, with disco...and so on... everything but the kitchen sink, in other words.  It even has an animated scene where the leads turn into fishes for Godsakes!  And start singing!! And sometimes a big crazy kitchen sink story like this can be a lot of fun; but this movie doesn't have the panache and style  to pull that kind of thing off; so it just comes off as weird...As if the producers were really stoned when they wrote this...The only commendable thing here is the music...By ELO...That's actually pretty good most of the time. (The album was actually a smash and one of its singles, "Magic", hit the number one spot on the Billboard charts for several weeks... Even if the movie itself bombed). And that's not enough to recommend it.   ðŸ‘Ž
P.S. There's an excellent Broadway spoof of this which is much better than the original; and is definitely worth checking out if you get a chance.

This movie is not everyone's cup of tea, which is why it gets the mixed reception that it does. The reason is that it's not made for someone looking for a good plot. It's made for people who love music and dancing; and what better way of catering to their taste than collecting Olivia Newton-John, Gene Kelly, and Electric Light Orchestra? Xanadu features great music and great numbers, that no matter your opinion about it, you will sure end up leaving while still singing the song of the same name.
