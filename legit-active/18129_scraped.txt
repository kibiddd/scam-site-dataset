In a speech that also rejected a push for stronger local content rules, Mr Walsh acknowledged yesterday that the resources boom was having nasty side-effects on other sectors.Sam Walsh ... resources boom not just luck.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen ''For Australia there will be some pain and readjustment associated with all the gains that we're enjoying as a nation in pole position at the great 21st century Asian boom,'' Mr Walsh said at an Australian Industry Group conference in Canberra. ''It's likely our dollar will remain strong, with a detriment to the manufacturing industry … export industries, as well as key sectors such as education and tourism.'' Ai Group is pushing Canberra to shield manufacturers from the high dollar, but Mr Walsh bluntly rejected calls for the government to redistribute wealth away from miners. Unions, for instance, want new rules requiring minimum levels of local content, while the Greens are vowing to push for a higher mining tax at a federal tax summit next month. ''Lately we've heard a good deal about these changes with suggestions from some that what's required is punitive measures on the prospering sectors of our economy, such as mandating domestic procurement to artificially support others,'' Mr Walsh said. ''Such analysis ignores the flow-on benefits of growth in the minerals sector.'' A report commissioned by ANZ Bank, cited by Mr Walsh, said this month that 750,000 new jobs would be created in resources by 2030. Mr Walsh said more than 70 per cent of Rio's project spending went to locally owned firms. He rejected the notion that mining companies had stumbled on the resources boom through luck alone. Recent bumper profits were the result of long-planned investments, he said. ''It took Rio Tinto 25 years from when we first started mining to extract 1 billion tonnes of ore. We've now mined more than three [billion], '' he said.
