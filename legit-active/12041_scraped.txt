Fryderyk Chopin University of Music
The Fryderyk Chopin University of Music (Polish: Uniwersytet Muzyczny Fryderyka Chopina, UMFC) is located at ulica Okólnik 2 in central Warsaw, Poland. It is the oldest and largest music school in Poland, and one of the largest in Europe.
History
Named for the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin (whose birth name was Fryderyk Chopin and who studied there from 1826 to 1829), the University dates from the Music School for singers and theatre actors that was founded in 1810 by Wojciech Bogusławski. In 1820 it was transformed by Chopin's subsequent teacher, Józef Elsner, into a more general school of music, the Institute of Music and Declamation; it was then affiliated with the University of Warsaw and, together with the University, was dissolved by Russian imperial authorities during the repressions that followed the November 1830 Uprising. In 1861 it was revived as Warsaw's Institute of Music.
After Poland regained independence in 1918, the Institute was taken over by the Polish state and became known as the Warsaw Conservatory. The institution's old main building was destroyed during World War II, in the Warsaw Uprising. After the war, in 1946, the school was recreated as the Higher State School of Music. In 1979 the school assumed the name: Fryderyk Chopin Music Academy. In 2008 the school once again changed its name to the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music.

Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa [varˈʂava]; see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland. It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland, roughly 260 kilometres (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1.740 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city limits cover 516.9 square kilometres (199.6 sq mi), while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres (2,355.39 sq mi).
In 2012 the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Warsaw as the 32nd most liveable city in the world. It was also ranked as one of the most liveable cities in Central Europe. Today Warsaw is considered an "Alpha–" global city, a major international tourist destination and a significant cultural, political and economic hub. Warsaw's economy, by a wide variety of industries, is characterised by FMCG manufacturing, metal processing, steel and electronic manufacturing and food processing. The city is a significant centre of research and development, BPO, ITO, as well as of the Polish media industry. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe.Frontex, the European Union agency for external border security, has its headquarters in Warsaw. It has been said that Warsaw, together with Frankfurt, London, Paris and Barcelona is one of the cities with the highest number of skyscrapers in Europe. Warsaw has also been called "Eastern Europe’s chic cultural capital with thriving art and club scenes and serious restaurants".

Joy Division
Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook, and drummer Stephen Morris.
Formed by Sumner and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label, Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album, Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis, who suffered from personal problems that included severe depression, a failing marriage, and epilepsy, found it increasingly difficult to perform at live concerts, during which he occasionally collapsed into seizures.

Warszawa Chopina (Chopin's Warsaw)
W Roku Chopinowskim Warszawa zaprezentowała film, w którym przywołane zostało XIX-wieczne miasto - takie, jakie znał młody Fryderyk. Kompozytor mieszkał w Warszawie przez 20 lat. Jest tu wiele miejsc z nim związanych. To mieszkania, w których żyli Chopinowie, Uniwersytet Warszawski gdzie się kształcił, kościoły i sale pałaców gdzie koncertował, kawiarnie, w których bywał  wreszcie kościół Św. Krzyża, w którym zgodnie z  ostatnią wolą Chopina spoczęło jego serce.
Mimo upływu lat, a zwłaszcza zniszczeń Warszawy podczas II wojny  światowej, wiele z tych miejsc ocalało, a odnajdziemy je głównie na Krakowskim Przedmieściu. Trzydziestominutowy film Warszawa Chopina, którego premiera odbyła się 19 lutego, prezentuje je takimi, jakimi są dzisiaj  jako miejsca upamiętniające życie Chopina w nasz...

Zygmunt Noskowski (2 May 1846 – 23 July 1909) was a Polish composer, conductor and teacher. Noskowski was born in Warsaw and was originally trained at the Warsaw Conservatory studying violin and composition with Stanisław Moniuszko, graduated with distinction in 1867. A scholarship enabled him to travel to Berlin where between 1872 and 1875, he studied with Friedrich Kiel, one of Europe’s leading teachers of composition. After holding several positions - kapellmeister and conductor of the Bodan Choral Society in Konstanz, Noskowski returned to Warsaw in 1880 where he remained for the rest of his life, professor of composition at the Warsaw Conservatory and conductor of Warsaw Society of Friends and the Warsaw Philharmonic (1905-1908). He worked not only as a composer, but also became a famous teacher, a prominent conductor and a journalist. He was one of the leading figures in Polish music during the late 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. He taught virtually all of the important Polish composers of the next generation, including Karol Szymanowski and Grzegorz Fitelberg. He served as head of the Warsaw Music Society from 1880 to 1902 and was considered Poland’s leading composer during the last decade of his life. He died in Warsaw.

W Roku Chopinowskim Warszawa zaprezentowała film, w którym przywołane zostało XIX-wieczne miasto - takie, jakie znał młody Fryderyk. Kompozytor mieszkał w Warszawie przez 20 lat. Jest tu wiele miejsc z nim związanych. To mieszkania, w których żyli Chopinowie, Uniwersytet Warszawski gdzie się kształcił, kościoły i sale pałaców gdzie koncertował, kawiarnie, w których bywał  wreszcie kościół Św. Krzyża, w którym zgodnie z  ostatnią wolą Chopina spoczęło jego serce.
Mimo upływu lat, a zwłaszcza zniszczeń Warszawy podczas II wojny  światowej, wiele z tych miejsc ocalało, a odnajdziemy je głównie na Krakowskim Przedmieściu. Trzydziestominutowy film Warszawa Chopina, którego premiera odbyła się 19 lutego, prezentuje je takimi, jakimi są dzisiaj  jako miejsca upamiętniające życie Chopina w naszym mieście.
„Chopin`s Warsaw is a filmic journey around the city of Warsaw in the company of Frycek. That`s the name that was given to Fryderyk Chopin in his youth by his friends and family. See Warsaw, past and present, through his eyes. Discover the city where Poland`s greatest composer spent his youth.

Fryderyk Chopin University of Music
The Fryderyk Chopin University of Music (Polish: Uniwersytet Muzyczny Fryderyka Chopina, UMFC) is located at ulica Okólnik 2 in central Warsaw, Poland. It is the oldest and largest music school in Poland, and one of the largest in Europe.
History
Named for the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin (whose birth name was Fryderyk Chopin and who studied there from 1826 to 1829), the University dates from the Music School for singers and theatre actors that was founded in 1810 by Wojciech Bogusławski. In 1820 it was transformed by Chopin's subsequent teacher, Józef Elsner, into a more general school of music, the Institute of Music and Declamation; it was then affiliated with the University of Warsaw and, together with the University, was dissolved by Russian imperial authorities during the repressions that followed the November 1830 Uprising. In 1861 it was revived as Warsaw's Institute of Music.
After Poland regained independence in 1918, the Institute was taken over by the Polish state and became known as the Warsaw Conservatory. The institution's old main building was destroyed during World War II, in the Warsaw Uprising. After the war, in 1946, the school was recreated as the Higher State School of Music. In 1979 the school assumed the name: Fryderyk Chopin Music Academy. In 2008 the school once again changed its name to the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music.
