[구미호뎐 (Tale of the Nine Tailed) 1938 OST] 기현 (KIHYUN) (몬스타엑스)- Full Moon MV
몬스타엑스 기현, ‘구미호뎐1938’ 첫 OST ‘Full Moon’ 가창 주인공 낙점! 이동욱 서정적 마음 표현…몰입도 UP
지난 2020년 넬 김종완의 ‘Blue Moon’이 ‘구미호뎐’ OST의 시작을 화려하게 알렸듯, 이번에 공개되는 기현의 ‘Full Moon’ 역시 ‘구미호뎐 1938’ 포문을 여는 특별한 OST로 주목받고 있다.
‘구미호뎐1938’ 첫 OST ‘Full Moon’은 하드록과 일렉트로니카의 요소를 조합한 곡으로, 주인공 이연(이동욱 분)의 서정적인 마음, 그리고 보름달이 뜰 때 이연과 붉은 달이 혼연일체가 되어 하나의 정체성으로 변해가는 과정의 의미심장하고 격한 마음을 동시에 표현하고 있다.
또 이 곡이 운명을 넘어 숙명으로 얽힌 주인공의 복잡한 심리를 표현한 노래인 만큼, 가창을 맡은 기현은 애절하고 호소력 짙은 보이스로 곡의 완성도를 한층 높이는 동시에 폭발적인 가창력과 매력적인 음색으로 ‘Full Moon’만의 감성을 극대화시켰다.
기현은 지난 해 10월 발매한 두 번째 솔로앨범 ‘YOUTH’를 비롯해, 다양한 OST에 참여하며 장르를 가리지 않는 보컬리스트로서의 면모를 선보이고 있다. 이에 ‘구미호뎐1938’ 첫 OST ‘Full Moon’에도 관심이 쏠린다.

The Mysterious Dark Day of 1938 - No Sun, No Radio Signals
What would you do if the Sun was off? That's what the residents of Yamal, Siberia, had to deal with on September 18, 1938. In the morning, instead of going to work, they all gathered at the weather station. It was an "eclipse," which they later nicknamed "the black day." And neither astronomers nor meteorologists can explain what happened back then. Similar mysterious dark veils have occurred on our planet more than once.

1938 WORLD CUP FINAL: Italy 4-2 Hungary
With war clouds gathering over Europe, the third FIFA World Cup™ took place against a bleak backdrop yet football – not least the flamboyantly skilful brand practised by Brazil – provided a shaft of sunshine for the French crowds during a 15-day festival from which Italy, the strongest and most consistent side, emerged as worthy winners.
Together with coach Vittorio Pozzo, there were four survivors in Italy's squad from their 1934 triumph and two of them, Giuseppe Meazza and Giovanni Ferrari, figured prominently alongside star striker Silvio Piola, scorer of two goals in the 4-2 Final win over Hungary that ensured the Azzurri became the first team to successfully defend the trophy.

How the West Betrayed Czechoslovakia to Hitler (The Munich Agreement,1938)
At the dawning of the Second World War, emboldened by the Anschluss, Adolf Hitler turned his focus to the Sudetenland, a heavily industrialised region of Czechoslovakia with a considerable population of ethnic Germans. Fearing the outbreak of another bloody conflict, Britain and France entered into a policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany, engaging in a four-power conference that would culminate in the signing of the Munich Agreement. Ultimately, Hitler would betray the trust of the western powers, and the Munich Agreement is now remembered in history as a byword for the futility of appeasing aggressive, totalitarian states.
The fact that it took place in 1938 should tell you if it was successful or not!

Various shots of German troops marching (goose-stepping) past Governor Admiral Horthy, Regent of Hungary in a huge military parade.  German children watching in the crowds make the Nazi salute.  Soldiers on horseback, large artillery guns and army tanks also take part in the parade.
Commentator talks of the new field gun with a barrel forty feet long that appeared for the first time here - "Cameramen were forbidden to photograph it... on pain of being charged with treason.  No cameraman did photograph it - cameramen prefer to keep their heads!"
BRITISH PATHÉ'S STORY
Before television, people came to movie theatres to watch the news. British Pathé was at the forefront of cinematic journalism, blending information with entertainment to popular effect. Over the course of a century, it documented everything from major armed conflicts and seismic political crises to the curious hobbies and eccentric lives of ordinary people. If it happened, British Pathé filmed it.
Now considered to be the finest newsreel archive in the world, British Pathé is a treasure trove of 85,000 films unrivalled in their historical and cultural significance.
British Pathé also represents the Reuters historical collection, which includes more than 136,000 items from the news agencies Gaumont Graphic (1910-1932), Empire News Bulletin (1926-1930), British Paramount (1931-1957), and Gaumont British (1934-1959), as well as Visnews content from 1957 to the end of 1984.

The Great New England Hurricane of 1938
CAT 3 - September 21, 1938
The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 was one of the most destructive and powerful storms ever to strike Southern New England. This system developed in the far eastern Atlantic, near the Cape Verde Islands on September 4. It made a twelve day journey across the Atlantic and up the Eastern Seaboard before crashing ashore on September 21 at Suffolk County, Long Island, then into Milford, Connecticut. The eye of the hurricane was observed in New Haven, Connecticut, 10 miles east of Milford. The center made landfall at the time of astronomical high tide, moving north at 50 mph. Unlike most storms, this hurricane did not weaken on its way toward Southern New England, due to its rapid forward speed and its track. This kept the center of the storm over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.
Sustained hurricane force winds occurred throughout most of Southern New England. The strongest winds ever recorded in the region occurred at the Blue Hill Observatory with sustained winds of 121 mph and a peak gust of 186 mph. Sustained winds of 91 mph with a gust to 121 mph was reported on Block Island. Providence, Rhode Island recorded sustained winds of 100 mph with a gust to 125 mph. Extensive damage occurred to roofs, trees and crops. Widespread power outages occurred, which in some areas lasted several weeks. In Connecticut, downed power lines resulted in catastrophic fires to sections of New London and Mystic. The lowest pressure at the time of landfall occurred on the south side of Long Island, at Bellport, where a reading of 27.94 inches was recorded. Other low pressures included 28.00 inches in Middletown, Connecticut and 28.04 inches in Hartford, Connecticut.
The hurricane produced storm tides of 14 to 18 feet across most of the Connecticut coast, with 18 to 25 foot tides from New London east to Cape Cod. The destructive power of the storm surge was felt throughout the coastal community. Narragansett Bay took the worst hit, where a storm surge of 12 to 15 feet destroyed most coastal homes, marinas and yacht clubs. Downtown Providence, Rhode Island was submerged under a storm tide of nearly 20 feet. Sections of Falmouth and New Bedford, Massachusetts were submerged under as much as 8 feet of water. All three locations had very rapid tides increased within 1.5 hours of the highest water mark.
Rainfall from this hurricane resulted in severe river flooding across sections of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Three to six inches fell across much of western Massachusetts and all but extreme eastern Connecticut. Considerably less rain occurred to the east across Rhode Island and the remainder of Massachusetts. The rainfall from the hurricane added to the amounts that had occurred with a frontal system several days before the hurricane struck. The combined effects from the frontal system and the hurricane produced rainfall of 10 to 17 inches across most of the Connecticut River Valley. This resulted in some of the worst flooding ever recorded in this area. Roadways were washed away along with sections of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad lines. The Connecticut River, in Hartford reached a level of 35.4 feet, which was 19.4 feet above flood stage. Further upstream, in the vicinity of Springfield, Massachusetts, the river rose to 6 to 10 feet above flood stage, causing significant damage. A total of 8,900 homes, cottages and buildings were destroyed, and over 15,000 were damaged by the hurricane. The marine community was devastated. Over 2,600 boats were destroyed, and over 3,300 damaged. Entire fleets were lost in marines and yacht clubs along Narragansett Bay. The hurricane was responsible for 564 deaths and at least 1,700 injuries in Southern New England. Damage to the fishing fleets in Southern New England was catastrophic. A total of 2,605 vessels were destroyed, with 3,369 damaged.

What would you do if the Sun was off? That's what the residents of Yamal, Siberia, had to deal with on September 18, 1938. In the morning, instead of going to work, they all gathered at the weather station. It was an "eclipse," which they later nicknamed "the black day." And neither astronomers nor meteorologists can explain what happened back then. Similar mysterious dark veils have occurred on our planet more than once.

With war clouds gathering over Europe, the third FIFA World Cup™ took place against a bleak backdrop yet football – not least the flamboyantly skilful brand practised by Brazil – provided a shaft of sunshine for the French crowds during a 15-day festival from which Italy, the strongest and most consistent side, emerged as worthy winners.
Together with coach Vittorio Pozzo, there were four survivors in Italy's squad from their 1934 triumph and two of them, Giuseppe Meazza and Giovanni Ferrari, figured prominently alongside star striker Silvio Piola, scorer of two goals in the 4-2 Final win over Hungary that ensured the Azzurri became the first team to successfully defend the trophy.

At the dawning of the Second World War, emboldened by the Anschluss, Adolf Hitler turned his focus to the Sudetenland, a heavily industrialised region of Czechoslovakia with a considerable population of ethnic Germans. Fearing the outbreak of another bloody conflict, Britain and France entered into a policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany, engaging in a four-power conference that would culminate in the signing of the Munich Agreement. Ultimately, Hitler would betray the trust of the western powers, and the Munich Agreement is now remembered in history as a byword for the futility of appeasing aggressive, totalitarian states.
The fact that it took place in 1938 should tell you if it was successful or not!

Berlin, Germany.
Various shots of German troops marching (goose-stepping) past Governor Admiral Horthy, Regent of Hungary in a huge military parade.  German children watching in the crowds make the Nazi salute.  Soldiers on horseback, large artillery guns and army tanks also take part in the parade.
Commentator talks of the new field gun with a barrel forty feet long that appeared for the first time here - "Cameramen were forbidden to photograph it... on pain of being charged with treason.  No cameraman did photograph it - cameramen prefer to keep their heads!"
BRITISH PATHÉ'S STORY
Before television, people came to movie theatres to watch the news. British Pathé was at the forefront of cinematic journalism, blending information with entertainment to popular effect. Over the course of a century, it documented everything from major armed conflicts and seismic political crises to the curious hobbies and eccentric lives of ordinary people. If it happened, British Pathé filmed it.
Now considered to be the finest newsreel archive in the world, British Pathé is a treasure trove of 85,000 films unrivalled in their historical and cultural significance.
British Pathé also represents the Reuters historical collection, which includes more than 136,000 items from the news agencies Gaumont Graphic (1910-1932), Empire News Bulletin (1926-1930), British Paramount (1931-1957), and Gaumont British (1934-1959), as well as Visnews content from 1957 to the end of 1984. All footage can be viewed on the British Pathé website. https://www.britishpathe.com/

[구미호뎐 (Tale of the Nine Tailed) 1938 OST] 기현 (KIHYUN) (몬스타엑스)- Full Moon MV
몬스타엑스 기현, ‘구미호뎐1938’ 첫 OST ‘Full Moon’ 가창 주인공 낙점! 이동욱 서정적 마음 표현…몰입도 UP
지난 2020년 넬 김종완의 ‘Blue Moon’이 ‘구미호뎐’ OST의 시작을 화려하게 알렸듯, 이번에 공개되는 기현의 ‘Full Moon’ 역시 ‘구미호뎐 1938’ 포문을 여는 특별한 OST로 주목받고 있다.
‘구미호뎐1938’ 첫 OST ‘Full Moon’은 하드록과 일렉트로니카의 요소를 조합한 곡으로, 주인공 이연(이동욱 분)의 서정적인 마음, 그리고 보름달이 뜰 때 이연과 붉은 달이 혼연일체가 되어 하나의 정체성으로 변해가는 과정의 의미심장하고 격한 마음을 동시에 표현하고 있다.
또 이 곡이 운명을 넘어 숙명으로 얽힌 주인공의 복잡한 심리를 표현한 노래인 만큼, 가창을 맡은 기현은 애절하고 호소력 짙은 보이스로 곡의 완성도를 한층 높이는 동시에 폭발적인 가창력과 매력적인 음색으로 ‘Full Moon’만의 감성을 극대화시켰다.
기현은 지난 해 10월 발매한 두 번째 솔로앨범 ‘YOUTH’를 비롯해, 다양한 OST에 참여하며 장르를 가리지 않는 보컬리스트로서의 면모를 선보이고 있다. 이에 ‘구미호뎐1938’ 첫 OST ‘Full Moon’에도 관심이 쏠린다.

Edward Herrmann narrates this gripping documentary originally aired on the History Channel in 2006.  It depicts the horrifying, unexpected hurricane that blasted through New England on a late September day, 1938, killing hundreds caught in its vicious path of destruction.

The Great New England Hurricane of 1938
CAT 3 - September 21, 1938
The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 was one of the most destructive and powerful storms ever to strike Southern New England. This system developed in the far eastern Atlantic, near the Cape Verde Islands on September 4. It made a twelve day journey across the Atlantic and up the Eastern Seaboard before crashing ashore on September 21 at Suffolk County, Long Island, then into Milford, Connecticut. The eye of the hurricane was observed in New Haven, Connecticut, 10 miles east of Milford. The center made landfall at the time of astronomical high tide, moving north at 50 mph. Unlike most storms, this hurricane did not weaken on its way toward Southern New England, due to its rapid forward speed and its track. This kept the center of the storm over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.
Sustained hurricane force winds occurred throughout most of Southern New England. The strongest winds ever recorded in the region occurred at the Blue Hill Observatory with sustained winds of 121 mph and a peak gust of 186 mph. Sustained winds of 91 mph with a gust to 121 mph was reported on Block Island. Providence, Rhode Island recorded sustained winds of 100 mph with a gust to 125 mph. Extensive damage occurred to roofs, trees and crops. Widespread power outages occurred, which in some areas lasted several weeks. In Connecticut, downed power lines resulted in catastrophic fires to sections of New London and Mystic. The lowest pressure at the time of landfall occurred on the south side of Long Island, at Bellport, where a reading of 27.94 inches was recorded. Other low pressures included 28.00 inches in Middletown, Connecticut and 28.04 inches in Hartford, Connecticut.
The hurricane produced storm tides of 14 to 18 feet across most of the Connecticut coast, with 18 to 25 foot tides from New London east to Cape Cod. The destructive power of the storm surge was felt throughout the coastal community. Narragansett Bay took the worst hit, where a storm surge of 12 to 15 feet destroyed most coastal homes, marinas and yacht clubs. Downtown Providence, Rhode Island was submerged under a storm tide of nearly 20 feet. Sections of Falmouth and New Bedford, Massachusetts were submerged under as much as 8 feet of water. All three locations had very rapid tides increased within 1.5 hours of the highest water mark.
Rainfall from this hurricane resulted in severe river flooding across sections of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Three to six inches fell across much of western Massachusetts and all but extreme eastern Connecticut. Considerably less rain occurred to the east across Rhode Island and the remainder of Massachusetts. The rainfall from the hurricane added to the amounts that had occurred with a frontal system several days before the hurricane struck. The combined effects from the frontal system and the hurricane produced rainfall of 10 to 17 inches across most of the Connecticut River Valley. This resulted in some of the worst flooding ever recorded in this area. Roadways were washed away along with sections of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad lines. The Connecticut River, in Hartford reached a level of 35.4 feet, which was 19.4 feet above flood stage. Further upstream, in the vicinity of Springfield, Massachusetts, the river rose to 6 to 10 feet above flood stage, causing significant damage. A total of 8,900 homes, cottages and buildings were destroyed, and over 15,000 were damaged by the hurricane. The marine community was devastated. Over 2,600 boats were destroyed, and over 3,300 damaged. Entire fleets were lost in marines and yacht clubs along Narragansett Bay. The hurricane was responsible for 564 deaths and at least 1,700 injuries in Southern New England. Damage to the fishing fleets in Southern New England was catastrophic. A total of 2,605 vessels were destroyed, with 3,369 damaged.

What would you do if the Sun was off? That's what the residents of Yamal, Siberia, had to deal with on September 18, 1938. In the morning, instead of going to work, they all gathered at the weather station. It was an "eclipse," which they later nicknamed "the black day." And neither astronomers nor meteorologists can explain what happened back then. Similar mysterious dark veils have occurred on our planet more than once.

With war clouds gathering over Europe, the third FIFA World Cup™ took place against a bleak backdrop yet football – not least the flamboyantly skilful brand practised by Brazil – provided a shaft of sunshine for the French crowds during a 15-day festival from which Italy, the strongest and most consistent side, emerged as worthy winners.
Together with coach Vittorio Pozzo, there were four survivors in Italy's squad from their 1934 triumph and two of them, Giuseppe Meazza and Giovanni Ferrari, figured prominently alongside star striker Silvio Piola, scorer of two goals in the 4-2 Final win over Hungary that ensured the Azzurri became the first team to successfully defend the trophy.

At the dawning of the Second World War, emboldened by the Anschluss, Adolf Hitler turned his focus to the Sudetenland, a heavily industrialised region of Czechoslovakia with a considerable population of ethnic Germans. Fearing the outbreak of another bloody conflict, Britain and France entered into a policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany, engaging in a four-power conference that would culminate in the signing of the Munich Agreement. Ultimately, Hitler would betray the trust of the western powers, and the Munich Agreement is now remembered in history as a byword for the futility of appeasing aggressive, totalitarian states.
