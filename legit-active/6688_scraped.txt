The most common types of software bugs are memory management bugs. And very often they lead to the most tragic consequences. There are many types of memory bugs, but the only ones that matter now are memory leaks due to circular references, when two or more objects directly or indirectly refer to each other, causing the RAM available to the application to gradually decrease because it cannot be freed.
Memory leaks due to circular references are the most difficult to analyze, while all other types have been successfully solved for a long time. All other memory bugs can be solved at the programming language level (for example, with garbage collectors, borrow checking or library templates), but the problem of memory leaks due to circular references remains unsolved to this day.
But it seems to me that there is a very simple way to solve the problem of memory leaks due to circular references in a program, which can be implemented in almost any typed programming language, of course, if you do not use the all-permissive keyword unsafe for Rust or std::reinterpret_cast in the case of C++.Read more →Rating0Add to bookmarks2Comments1Articleaymericzip  Mar  21  at 16:42A React Native & Lynx i18n solution that keeps your translations organizedLevel of difficultyEasyReading time3 minViews93React Native*JavaScript*ReactJS*TutorialIf you’re building a multilingual React Native (or web) app, you’ve probably tried react-i18next, i18n-js, LinguiJS, or similar libraries.But in every project, the same issues come up: ❌ Unused key-value pairs are never removed ❌ Content gets duplicated ❌ Ensuring format consistency across languages is painful ❌ i18next doesn’t generate TypeScript types by default – so t("my.key") won’t throw even if it’s been deleted ❌ Localization platforms like Lokalise or Locize get expensive fastFrustrated by these challenges, I waited for a better solution... then decided to build one myself: Intlayer.Read moreRating0Add to bookmarks1Comments0Articlekentavr009  Mar  21  at 14:07How to Bypass Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA – or Bypassing Cloudflare at Varying Levels of DifficultyLevel of difficultyEasyReading time18 minViews280Python*OpinionTranslationAs part of my scientific and research interests, I decided to experiment with bypassing complex types of CAPTCHAs.

High costs, database scalability limits, and complex administration create major hurdles. That’s why smart businesses rely on Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) — a structured approach that automates data management based on policies and best practices.With Postgres Pro Enterprise 17, ILM is now easier than ever, thanks to the pgpro_ilm extension. This tool enables seamless data tiering, much like Oracle's ILM functionality. Let’s dive into the challenges of managing large databases, how ILM solves them, and how you can implement it in Postgres Pro Enterprise 17.Read moreRating0Add to bookmarks1Comments0Articlevasilevafb  Mar  20  at 09:58You Can Grow or Stay Stuck: It All Depends on Your MindsetLevel of difficultyEasyReading time2 minViews204HabrIT-emigrationOpinionCheck Yourself:– Does your mindset hold you back? – Do you try to look smarter than you are? – Do you avoid difficult tasks to not seem "incompetent"? – Do you believe success is all about talent, not effort? – Do you think working harder means you're less talented?If you said yes to these, Read moreRating0Add to bookmarks0Comments0Articleprofleaddev  Mar  18  at 07:51Master Google AI Studio in 10 MinutesLevel of difficultyEasyReading time9 minViews573Artificial IntelligenceTutorialHey everyone!

I only read and posted in the Python forum (1 million subscribers!). Yesterday, I unexpectedly received a shadow ban. This means that my comments and posts are invisible to others. Essentially, it's read-only.I created several new accounts from different IPs and devices. It turned out that email verification is no longer required. This process takes 15 seconds. On some accounts, I verified the email, but it didn't help. Here's an example of a newly created account without email verification, and it's still active because nothing has been done on it: https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Half8140/If you have the ability to receive a verification code via email like dff35fghf@hfhlltgf.com, you'll automatically get a free PRO version of the account, which includes advanced statistics and other perks. However, the account remains in a "pre-ban" state.Upon testing, I found that all new accounts are in this "pre-ban" state. This means you can change your avatar, read, vote, and the accounts are visible when logged out or from a private browser window.However, attempting to post on your own wall (which automatically appears upon registration), write any comment in any discussion thread (even in /askReddit and /NewToReddit), create a post in any group, invite someone as a moderator to your wall, or follow someone without karma results in an instant shadow ban. The account becomes invisible from a private window and logged-out devices, the avatar turns red, and it cannot be changed.The symptoms are the same for all IPs and languages (English, Polish, Russian). ChatGPT says that this is how it is now, and a ban is very likely. However, I see some activity in groups about Moscow and St. Petersburg, which means people somehow manage to pass this test... But how?AI Reddit is going wild!Tags:redditLike+2DislikeAdd to bookmarks1Comments0ArticleMarkus_automation  Mar  6  at 08:50What Are Resident Proxies and How Do They Work: A Detailed Guide for BeginnersLevel of difficultyEasyReading time5 minViews646Information Security*ReviewOften at work, I encounter services that provide offerings such as resident proxies. Yet, I have never delved deeply into the topic. I have always simply consumed the product “as is,” as some lazy authors like to say.I have a general understanding of how this type of service works at a layman’s level, and I became interested in exploring the topic more deeply and attempting to share the conclusions I reached through a deeper understanding of what resident proxies are. Let’s see what comes out of it. No recommendations here—just the subjective, evaluative opinion of yet another “specialist.”Proxy servers are intermediaries between your device and the internet, allowing you to hide your real IP address and alter the appearance of your connection. Think of it as a white camouflage coat in snowy weather, if we speak in very simplistic terms. Let’s start from that—options for camouflage. However, comparing with camouflage coats would be rather dull; instead, let’s recall animals and insects that use camouflage and try to draw a parallel. In fact, I’ve already done so.Read moreTotal votes 1: ↑1 and ↓0+1Add to bookmarks2Comments0PostOksenija  Mar  5  at 13:57Views10KAbnormal programming*Python*Programming*Data visualization*Popular scienceAdd animated own logo to your Matplotlib scientific graphics for branding purposes >>take source code X.com (twitter) Tags:pythonmatplotlibLike+1DislikeAdd to bookmarks1Comments0Articlemelanny20  Mar  4  at 14:00The Future of PostgreSQL: How a 64-bit Transaction Counter Solves Scaling IssuesLevel of difficultyMediumReading time5 minViews479Postgres Professional corporate blogPostgreSQL*ReviewTranslationFor many years, the PostgreSQL community was skeptical about using this database management system (DBMS) for high-transaction environments. While PostgreSQL worked well for lab tests, mid-tier web applications, and smaller backend systems, it was believed that for heavy transactional loads, you’d need an expensive DBMS designed specifically for such purposes. As a result, PostgreSQL wasn’t particularly developed in that direction, leaving a range of issues unanswered.However, the reality has turned out differently. More and more of our clients are encountering problems that stem from this mindset. For example, in the global PostgreSQL community, it’s considered that 64 cores is the maximum size of a server where PostgreSQL can run effectively. But we’re now seeing that this is becoming a minimum typical configuration. One particular bottleneck that has emerged is the transaction counter, and this is a far more interesting issue. So, let’s dive into what the problem is, how we solved it, and what the international community thinks about it.Read moreTotal votes 4: ↑4 and ↓0+7Add to bookmarks3Comments0BackHere123 ... 4950ThereBackYour accountLog inSign upSectionsArticlesNewsHubsAuthorsSandboxInformationHow it worksFor authorsFor companiesDocumentsAgreementConfidentialServicesCorporate blogsAdvertisingNative advertisingEducation programsStartupsFacebookTwitterTelegram Language settingsSupport© 2006–2025, Habr
