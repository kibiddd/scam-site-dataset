That is a nice release. Hope they are using existing HG/JC/JX mould.

Re: NEW RELEASE: 1:200 Herpa Air Canada Express / Sky Regional Airlines DHC-8-Q402
Hurrmph  all well and good but I was sort of vainly hoping for the `original' AC Q400 (non-Express, green nacelles) livery which only saw a brief light of day. Ah well.
Perhaps GJ can think of this one... AC/Q400 fans would still go for it.
And Porter.

Ah, yes -- the question I keep asking myself.
Porter seems to have ignored Herpa, but I know Gemini did a 1:400 Q400 of theirs, so maybe they can apply that license to 1:200???
Anyhow, I have no interest in AC.

I'm all over this. I hope Herpa colors the engine pylons the correct color.

No.. Herpa have their own mould. This is not their first Q400 to be honest with you.
