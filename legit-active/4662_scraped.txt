The name comes from when a family lived in the village of Stapleton which could be found in the counties of Cumberland, Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Somerset and Yorkshire. The surname Stapleton is a habitation name that was originally derived from pre-existing names for towns, villages, parishes, or farmsteads. The surname originated as a means of identifying individuals from a particular area. In the Middle Ages people often assumed the name of the place that they originally lived as their surname during the course of travel. In this case the surname Stapleton was originally derived from the Old English terms which denoted a farm with a prominent pillar. 1Loading... Early Origins of the Stapleton familyThe surname Stapleton was first found in Yorkshire where they held a family seat from very ancient times, where tradition states that Octa, brother of Hengis, the Saxon invader, in the year 450, came north to defend his territory against the Picts, and established a fort on the banks of the Tees calling it Stapleton. In 1052, Heryon, was Lord of the manor of Stapleton upon Tees. We draw the reader's attention to Saddleworth cum Quick in Yorkshire. "At the time of the Conquest, Saddleworth was constituted a manor; and in the year 1200, William de Stapleton, to whom it then belonged, founded a chapel here for his tenants, which he made subordinate to the church of St. Chad, Rochdale. From the Stapletons the portion of the manor called Friermere or Friar-Mere, which is in extent one-half of the chapelry." 2 Walter de Stapeldon (1261-1326), was Bishop of Exeter, and virtual founder of Exeter College, Oxford, a younger son of William and Mabilla de Stapeldon, was born at Annery in the parish of Monkleigh, Devonshire. 3"The most notable of the ecclesiastical lords of Ashburton, [Devon] in his connection with that town, was Bishop Stapledon, who held the See of Exeter from 1308 to 1327. He was partial to the little burgh on the verge of the Dartmoor highlands, and frequently resided in its manor-house. Two years after his accession he procured the grant of a market and fair ; and four years later still founded the Guild or Fraternity of St. Lawrence, giving it a chapel which he had erected within the precincts of his court. The present edifice, therefore, very closely marks the site of the episcopal palace. " 4Brian de Stapleton (1321?-1394), of Wighill, knight, was the second son of Sir Gilbert de Stapleton, and younger brother of Miles de Stapleton (d. 1364.)"The manor of Carwythenack in the [parish of Constantine, Cornwall] belonged so early as the reign of Edward II. to the family of Stapleton." 5Sir Miles Stapleton, of Bedale, Yorkshire was Lord of Ingham, Norfolk by marriage in 1360 to Joanna, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Oliver de Ingham.Loading...

Stapleton migration to West Indies +The British first settled the British West Indies around 1604. They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 19Stapleton Settlers in West Indies in the 17th CenturyPierce Stapleton who settled in St. Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635Pierce Stapleton, aged 22, who arrived in St Christopher in 1635 10Mr. Pierce Stapleton, (b. 1613), aged 22, British settler traveling aboard the ship "Matthew" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 20 Contemporary Notables of the name Stapleton (post 1700) +Michael Patrick Stapleton (b. 1966), Canadian former professional hockey player who played fourteen seasons in the National Hockey League from 1986 until 2001Patrick James "Pat" Stapleton (1940-2020), nicknamed "Whitey", Canadian NHL ice hockey player who played from 1959 to 1978, inductee into the World Hockey Association Hall of Fame in 2010, father of Mike StapletonThomas Stapleton (1805-1849), English antiquary, the second son of Thomas Stapleton of Carlton Hall, YorkshireGregory Stapleton (1748-1802), English Catholic prelate, born at Carlton, Yorkshire, seventh son of Nicholas StapletonAugustus Granville Stapleton (1800-1880), English biographer of George Canning and political pamphleteerCyril Stapleton (1914-1974), English violinist and jazz bandleaderHarold Vincent Stapleton (1915-2015), Australian cricketer who played a first-class match for New South Wales in 1941Clayton Stapleton (1921-2014), American football player, coach, and college athletics administratorJean Stapleton (1923-2013), American actress of stage, television and film, best known for her portrayal of the long-suffering, yet devoted wife of Archie BunkerLois Maureen Stapleton (1925-2006), Academy Award-winning American actress in film, theater and television, who also won an Emmy Award, two Tony Awards and was elected to the American Theatre Hall of Fame...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.
