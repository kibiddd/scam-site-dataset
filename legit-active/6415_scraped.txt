Sperm Banks
This web page contains a list of sperm banks located in the United States.
Here are three types of sperm banking offered on this page:
Anonymous   - This is the typical service offered by most sperm
banks - the sperm donor is anonymous and will remain anonymous.
"ID Release" - Some sperm banks offer donors "willing to be known"
when a child reaches age 18, at the child's request.
Private   - Male patients can preserve their ability to
procreate, for example, after their cancer treatment is over. A man's sperm
can be frozen, then later thawed, and available for future use if that man is
unable to naturally produce semen. This is a form of biological insurance.
