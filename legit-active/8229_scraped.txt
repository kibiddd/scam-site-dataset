WHOBaba O'Riley Lyrics
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Sally, take my hand, travel south crossland
Put out the fire don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older
Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, oh
Teenage wasteland, they're all wasted

I agree with lotusmaglitle, the lyric is 'don't cry; don't BRACE your eye' The Who is truly an inspiring band.
