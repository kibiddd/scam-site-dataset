CHHS Class of '73 Deceased
Welcome To Our Class Website
A place to keep in contact with each other, keep up on events such as reunions or other alumni social gatherings, to keep our contact information up to date and a photo gallery to help us with our memories.
Here you will find links to related sites like the Cherry  Hill High School Alumni site, other class sites at their request, St. Norbert School news for our Shared Time classmates and other activities and stories of interest. Perhaps some links to a few of our various elementary schools would make our search for old friends complete.
Hopefully, you will find this site interesting and fun and we invite you to participate with ideas, photos or technical assistance. Our class was very large, about 360, and it is difficult to remember each name and face so we ask your help.Â  Please let us know if there are misspelled names or if we have incorrect information on someone anywhere on these pages. We have completed the yearbook scans for the Classmates page so be sure to check it out, it IS how we remember each other! Any help with missing photos would be greatly appreciated. If you are not happy with the photo of yourself we would love to update it to one you submit as long as it is in the same reasonable time period.
Please feel free to use our Feedback page for any ideas or comments, questions or suggestions you have about this site. If you have photos you'd to submit for consideration on our Gallery page, email the webmaster directly at webmaster@chhs1973.org and add them as an attachment.
