If you really want to take share, 30-50% on first pass and make it hurt for Comcast & Spectrum, this is how you do it, First 3 Months FREE.  I've signed up over 1500 new fiber internet connects and just 10 have cancelled(4 were non-pays).  If you have a cancellation rate of <3% after 90 days, you'd be crazy not to do some promo like this.  Initial take rate will be much higher, plus the sales rep will close a much higher % on the first visit, no call-backs, frees up more time for the rep to get to more houses.  Take ALL of the OBJECTIONS away from the customer, just get it in the house.  IMHO

ACIS IT Solutions in Springfield, MO, expertly guides companies through the crucial transition from traditional phone systems to the advanced Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Our blog post, "Six Things to Consider Before You Install a VoIP Phone System," dives deep into the essentials every business must evaluate before making this significant switch.
ùóûùó≤ùòÜ ùóúùóªùòÄùó∂ùó¥ùóµùòÅùòÄ:
ùó¶ùó≤ùóÆùó∫ùóπùó≤ùòÄùòÄ ùóßùóøùóÆùóªùòÄùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª: Migrating to VoIP is more straightforward than you might think, especially with a seasoned provider like ACIS IT Solutions. The process hinges on understanding your network bandwidth and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requirements‚Äîtwo pillars of VoIP efficiency.
ùóïùóÆùóªùó±ùòÑùó∂ùó±ùòÅùóµ ùóòùòÄùòÄùó≤ùóªùòÅùó∂ùóÆùóπùòÄ: VoIP demands specific bandwidth levels to function optimally. This bandwidth facilitates not just your daily internet activities but also ensures crystal-clear VoIP calls without lags or disruptions. It's crucial to confer with your VoIP provider to gauge if your current internet setup meets these demands, ensuring a seamless operation of your VoIP system alongside other internet-based tasks.
ùó¶ùóúùó£ ùóôùòÇùóªùó±ùóÆùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅùóÆùóπùòÄ: With sufficient bandwidth, focusing on SIP becomes paramount. SIP allows for versatile call-making, seamlessly bridging traditional landlines and VoIP. Choosing the right VoIP solutions provider will unlock expert recommendations for SIP integration, ensuring your VoIP phones and equipment are perfectly tuned for superior communication.
The adoption of VoIP is more than an upgrade; it's a transformational shift in how businesses communicate internally and with the world. Whether it's the expansive reach provided by SIP trunking or the sophisticated management of internal communications via PBX systems, VoIP is redefining business telephony.
For detailed insights and a thorough understanding of each critical consideration before installing a VoIP system, visit our full blog post: https://lnkd.in/gf5JDJpF.
Equip your business with the knowledge to make an informed transition to VoIP, setting the stage for enhanced connectivity and innovation in communication.
