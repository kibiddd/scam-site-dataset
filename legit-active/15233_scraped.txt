Rocket News ReleaseThe Rocket announced that Trent Birt has joined the organization as the Vice President of Operations and the Corrado Micalef and Jamie Blanchard have returned to the coaching staff."We are excited to have Trent join the Rocket family", said President & Governor Serge Savard Jr. "We feel confident that Trent has the necessary skills to lead our organization at this time".In speaking about the opportunity, Birt said, "when Serge first approached me about this position it sounded intriguing but the more the discussions progressed the more I knew I wanted to be a part of this hockey club. My teaching profession was very rewarding but I was presented with an opportunity and vision here that I couldn't resist. Through my discussions with Serge, his passion showed that the Savard family is 100% committed to building a winner on and off the ice on PEI. I'm confident we can and will continue to bring this team into the community and in turn, bring more of the community into the rink. We have a loyal fan base right now but there is certainly room to improve. I know success comes through hard work, honesty and loyalty and this is what the community will see from me and this entire organization."Birt has a very strong organizational background, having taught in Eastern School District for past 12 years, the past 10 at Colonel Gray High School. He has been very involved in the community for the past 20 years through sports, volunteer work and his event management company TB Promotions. Birt was also a linesman in the Quebec League the first year it came to the Maritimes, so he is no stranger to the sport.The position was created because Kent Hudson has stepped down as GM of Business Operations to start his own consulting business. Hudson has helped make great strides with the hockey club, in his 4 years with the team, incorporating new forms of communication with the fans, and new ways to involve the players with the community. "Change can be a very positive thing," says Hudson. "Trent will bring his own ideas, and strategies to the table, and I know he's very driven towards this team's objectives, as a healthy member of PEI's business community".The Savard family, and the Rocket organization wish Kent the best of luck in his new ventures.Trent Birt will ease into his new position over the next month, as he wraps up his obligations to Colonel Grey High School, and especially his current students. Birt is expected to be operating in his full capacity following the QMJHL Annual Draft, which is held from May 31- June 5 in Victoriaville this year.In other Rocket news, Rocket Head Coach Gordie Dwyer is pleased to announce the return of Assistant Coach Corrado Micalef and Goalie Coach Jamie Blanchard for the 2011-2012 season. " Both are valued members of this organization. Cory's extensive knowledge of the game, the QMJHL, his work ethic and experience with our Rocket players will be a continued asset to our staff. Jamie's experience in the game and strengths with the goaltending position, will provide our players the expertise in that department as well as other aspects of the game."Season Ticket Reminder - Extra Early Bird DeadlineRocket fans are reminded that the extra early bird deadline ends on May 31.
