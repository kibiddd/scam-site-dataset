The MMFA's original temporary exhibitions combine various artistic disciplines – fine arts, music, film, fashion and design – and are exported around the world. Its rich encyclopedic collection, distributed among five pavilions, includes international art, world cultures, decorative arts and design, and Quebec and Canadian art. The Museum has seen exceptional growth in recent years with the addition of two new pavilions: the Claire and Marc Bourgie Pavilion, in 2011, and the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace, in 2016. The MMFA complex includes Bourgie Hall, a 460-seat concert hall. The Museum also houses the Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art Therapy, the largest educational complex in a North American art museum, enabling the MMFA to offer innovative educational, wellness and art therapy programmesRead moreDuration: More than 3 hoursSuggest edits to improve what we show.Improve this listingTours & experiencesExplore different ways to experience this place.See options3,248What is Travelers’ Choice?Tripadvisor gives a Travelers’ Choice award to accommodations, attractions and restaurants that consistently earn great reviews from travelers and are ranked within the top 10% of properties on Tripadvisor.Top ways to experience Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal and nearby attractionsMontreal: Private Tour with a Local Guide4.44.4 of 5 bubbles(14)Private Sightseeing Toursfrom $39.26 per adult (price varies by group size)Explore Downtown Montreal -

We had an amazing time exploring everything. Parking was a bit tricky, so I'd suggest taking local transportation. The museum has several floors, and there are elevators to help you get around. Tickets are usually about $20 and can be bought in advance or at the reception, but the best part is that it's free for everyone on the first Sunday of each month. It's definitely worth a visit!Read moreVisited July 2024Traveled as a coupleWritten July 10, 2024KittalynNew York City, New York165 contributions5 of 5 bubblesFree tickets available from Christmas until New Years to explore the collections of these interconnected galleries (there’s a tunnel underneath the streets).
We focused on the Canadian art which was a smaller building, with each floor dedicated to a different time period. There was a painting by a Cree artist whose name I can’t remember that really stuck out to me, I’ll attach to this review. It depicts a massacre of beavers? Some of which are praying with rosaries? Very interesting.
Great way to spend the day, easily could have done a lot longer here. Bathroom in the Canadian art building had really interesting strained glass windows.
Note we are a family visiting but we’re all adults.Read moreVisited December 2024Traveled with familyWritten December 27, 2024traveltheworld012Rochester, Minnesota17,435 contributions5 of 5 bubblesWe were visiting Montreal for the first time August 1-8, 2024. On our 4th day we took the metro subway from the Old Port area to Guy-Concordia station. From there it's just a short walk to the museum. The address brings us to the large old building with pillared front that says it is the museum, but there is no entry. On the side below the steps, I encountered a young man entering a door. I asked him if this was the museum entry. He said, "no, this is the cinema". What, where is the museum? .. he pointed directly across the street and said, "There". So we crossed back across the street to the actual museum. On this Sunday afternoon, it was very busy, and confusing. Finally, I approached a employee and he told us the museum was free today (normally $23) on the left but not on the right. Apparently, as I learned much later there are underground tunnels to other buildings and museum areas. I searched for a map to figure the place out. A guy sitting had laminated maps, so I took one but it really was no help at all. It didn't tell what floors had what, just a simple layout without much writing on it. Anyway, it was free and we were able to view fantastic original art, paintings, sculptures and artifacts on 3 or 4 floors and about 25 different rooms. Still the maze of rooms we wandered through didn't seem to have themes and no map or signs directing us. Enjoyed the visit despite all the confusion and mystery of the place.Read moreVisited August 2024Traveled as a coupleWritten August 21, 2024sg mJapan342 contributions5 of 5 bubblesIt was free for citizens (tourists are OK) over the Christmas period. There were multiple buildings and I thought that if I just looked at them slowly they would probably go under for half a day. In addition to Western paintings, the museum was also rich in ancient civilizations and early modern paintings from the East and Latin America.
It was also good to see a lot of Inuit art as a very Canadian exhibit. It was very exciting to see so many different things, from folklore to contemporary.Read moreVisited December 2024Traveled soloWritten January 21, 2025Ryo ZLas Vegas, Nevada1,821 contributions4 of 5 bubblesIt’s a rainy day in Montreal and I’m on vacation and thought I should do something that was indoors and I love museums.
I’m happy I was able to get out of the rain but look at some fabulous art.
There’s about 4 floors, so I started from the top and worked my way down.
Great place for families with kids. They have an interactive space for both the parents and children.
On the 2nd floor there a small cafe with grab and go beverages and snacks.
Large bags and backpack will need to go to the coat check, good news it’s free!
There were a lot of great art pieces to see here, it’s worth the visit and keeps one out of the rain.Read moreVisited July 2024Traveled soloWritten July 1, 2024NutharinBangkok, Thailand620 contributions4 of 5 bubblesA museum of art in downtown Montreal.

There are quite a few exposition each floor. Not big but good for people who love arts.
We come to look at Inuit arts. Interesting and different.
There is a souvenir shop on the first floor, mostly selling notebooks, bags and some jewelry.Read moreVisited January 2025Traveled with familyWritten January 4, 2025Geen TCiudad Madero, Mexico124 contributions5 of 5 bubblesLarge, beautiful museum, with minimalist finishes, classic and contemporary, a mix that they were able to enhance without ending badly, with multiple works of all kinds. Tickets with an affordable price either online or in person. Canada is a country with an official language of French, its second language perhaps English, but if you do not know any or little English, it will be difficult for you since the workers of any establishment will not be able to help you or will not want to. In the museum it is something similar, all the indications, footers of paintings and maps in English and French, the rooms are divided into 2 buildings and we did not know, in the end we had to spend very little time in the second buildingRead moreVisited May 2024Traveled as a coupleWritten May 1, 2024perlushaNorfolk, Virginia46 contributions4 of 5 bubblesPositive: The museum is a gem, don't miss it. It has some well-known pieces from Renaissance to modern art. For instance, Napoleonic expo is organized as  "a cabinet of curiosities", so you can spend an entire day there.  Museum attendants are friendly and speak English. Museum is very crowded, because it is so amazing. The current  exhibition of three hundred years of Flemish art is extraordinary and features works of the most famous artists of the era. It is also very, very crowded, but it is worth it.
Negative: Website advertises that the museum is open on Wednesday until 9 pm, but it failed to mention that only the temporary expo is open. Permanent exhibit closes at 5, as usual. It was huge bummer to arrive there at 4.30 pm. Stuff seems oblivious to this fact that causes visitors to miss the main expo in the museum.Read moreVisited July 2024Traveled as a coupleWritten August 6, 2024phvi2617Anaheim, California752 contributions4 of 5 bubblesThis extensive museum comprises several buildings connected by an underground passage, so there is a lot to see here.

The gallery was divided into several buildings and we browsed the main hall, which was quite enough. Graffiti House in the Old Town can be seen in the terrace position on the third or fourth floor, which is preferred.Read moreVisited August 2024Traveled with familyWritten August 19, 2024These reviews are the subjective opinion of Tripadvisor members and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The layout of the museum is very awkward at best, it's very hard to figure out an orderly way to see it, and to know what you want to see, and what and where you have already been.  There is very poor signage, and sometimes none at all.  There is also no one to ask for any help.  For $30, they don't give out a small paper map.  There is one little board that has a layout map, and there were dozens of people crowding around trying to see it.  They want you to scan a QR code to have some map on your cell phone, I prefer not to look at my cell phone in a museum.  I was kind of shocked at how difficult they made it to figure out where you are and even what is available to see.In some of the buildings, the stairs aren't even labeled, so everyone has to wait for small elevators even to go up or down one floor.   It wasted so much time for no reason. I usually couldn't find the stairs.  Then you have to go underground to get between some buildings, and again, very poor labeling.  Instead of a sign like "Modern art this way", it would have a sign with the name of the person who donated for the wing like "The John Smith wing", which means nothing to me and most other people.  Very poor management who clearly don't think about this visitors. The collection itself was very impressive.  I went on a rainy day so it was more crowded than normal. I have to say the gift show was one of the best of any museum I've been to.  A much larger selection of great books than even the Metropolitan Art Museum in NYC.  And they had a "sale" section with amazing values on some books.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from going because of the awkwardness of the setup, hopefully they will make an effort to fix this easy problem.  If they only had maps around, or a small map handout, I would have given it 5 green circles.Read moreWritten August 30, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Revolution exhibit based on the 60's would appeal to a "60 something" person as it would prove nostalgic. There are 700 exhibits so it would take you about 90 min hours in my opinion. The cost is $ 12. The rest of the museum with its various pavilions would take you about 3 hours and cost a further $15. Local culture is not a main feature here, but worldwide fine art is. If you are short of time, the outstanding Redpath Museum on McGill campus would be my choice. 3 floors would take you a max of 90 min.Read moreWritten August 9, 2017AnswerRead all 5 responsesjmemrichSarasota, Florida88 contributionsAre there wheelchairs to borrow at the museum?
