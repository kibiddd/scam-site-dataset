Chemistry
Overview
State-of-the-art chemistry in an interactive environmentCentral to most fields of science, chemistry helps us to understand a range of topics including environmental issues, drugs and medicine, production of plastics and other materials, and nutrition. A fundamental understanding of chemistry is also important and interesting for its own sake. There is a great demand for chemists in many industries and government agencies. In fact, the chemical industry in Charlottetown and the rest of Canada is a booming business.
At UPEI we focus on providing truly excellent undergraduate and graduate programs while carrying out innovative chemical research. Our four-year BSc Honours, Majors, Minors, and Master’s degrees are accredited through the Canadian Society for Chemistry. There is a tremendous sense of excitement in both teaching and research in Chemistry at UPEI.
"I love UPEI's Chemistry program for the support and sense of community it offers."

Course Structure
Note: Current UPEI students should refer to Student Planning in myUPEI and the UPEI Academic Calendar governing their entry year, and speak to an academic advisor about course requirements. The course structure presented for this program is a recommended, unofficial progression for prospective students.
Note: As per Academic Regulation 1h, all undergraduate degree programs require successful completion of IKE-1040 (new for students beginning or returning after re-application in Fall 2022); one of UPEI-1010, UPEI-1020, or UPEI-1030, and a Writing Intensive Course.
Honours
The Honours Program in Chemistry is designed to provide research experience at the undergraduate level within the BSc program. It is available to students with a strong academic background who intend to continue studies at the post-graduate level in Chemistry or some related field, or to students who intend to pursue a career where research experience would be an asset.
The Honours Program differs from the major in requiring a two-semester research course with thesis report, in the requirement of 126 semester hours for the degree and in the requirement of an additional five advanced Chemistry courses. The following are the course requirements for the Honours Program in Chemistry:
First Year
Chemistry 1110-1120 - General Chemistry I and II
Biology 1310-1320 - General Biology I and II
Physics 1110-1120 or 1210-1220 - General Physics
Mathematics 1910-1920 - Single Variable Calculus I and II
Electives (6 semester hours)
Second Year
Chemistry 2210 - Analytical Chemistry
Chemistry 2410-2420 - Organic Chemistry I & II
Chemistry 2310 - Physical Chemistry I
Chemistry 2720 - Inorganic Chemistry I
Mathematics 2910 - Multivariable and Vector Calculus
Electives (9 semester hours)
Third Year
Chemistry 3220 - Analytical Instrumentation
Chemistry 3310 - Physical Chemistry II
Chemistry 3420 - Advanced Organic Chemistry
Chemistry 3530 - Biochemistry
Chemistry 3610 - Organic Spectroscopy
Chemistry 3740 - Inorganic Chemistry II
Chemistry elective (3 semester hours)
Mathematics elective (3 semester hours)
Electives (6 semester hours)
Fourth Year
Chemistry 4320 - Methods in Computational Chemistry
Chemistry 4410 - Physical Organic Chemistry
Chemistry 4670 - Inorganic Reaction Mechanisms and Catalysis
OR
Chemistry 4680 - Advanced Inorganic Chemistry
Chemistry 4900 - Honours Thesis (12 semester hours)
Chemistry electives (6 semester hours)
Electives (9 semester hours)
The Chemistry electives may be chosen from among Chemistry courses numbered: 2020, 2820, or any 4th year Chemistry course. The Mathematics elective may be chosen from Mathematics 2610, 3010, Statistics 1210, or Statistics 1910 in consultation with the Chair. As well, students in the Honours Program in Chemistry are strongly advised to take Physics 2120 (Electricity, Magnets, Circuits) and/or Physics 3120 (Electromagnetism I).
Honours students should note that Chemistry 4900 is a two-semester course and carries twelve semester hours of credit. No credit for the first semester will be granted without successful completion of the second semester of the course.
For admission to the Honours Program, students must have a minimum average of 70% in all previous courses; normally the Department expects high second-class standing or first-class standing in previous Chemistry courses. Permission of the Department is also required and is contingent on the student finding an Honours Advisor, on being assigned an advisory committee, on acceptance of the research project by the Chemistry Department, and on general acceptability. Students interested in doing Honours should consult with the Department Chair as early as possible and not later than March 31 of the student’s third year.
To graduate with a BSc Honours in Chemistry, students must complete 126 semester hours of credit which meet the required courses outlined above. As well, students must attain a 75% average in all Chemistry courses combined and must achieve a minimum overall average of 70% in all courses submitted for the degree. Students failing to meet the Honours requirements may apply for a transfer to the BSc Chemistry Major Program or to other degree programs.
Major
Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Chemistry must take at least 48 semester hours of chemistry in total and must at the same time complete certain courses as specified by the major requirements.
The required Chemistry courses are: Chemistry 1110-1120, Chemistry 2210, Chemistry 2410-2420, Chemistry 2310, Chemistry 2720, Chemistry 3220, Chemistry 3310, Chemistry 3420, Chemistry 3530, Chemistry 3610, Chemistry 3740, Chemistry 4820 OR 4830 and two Chemistry electives, at least one of which is at the 4th year level.
Additional course requirements for the Chemistry major include the following courses from other disciplines: Biology 1310-1320, Mathematics 1910, Mathematics 1920, and Mathematics 2910; Physics 1110-1120 or Physics 1210-1220.

Co-operative Education
Combining classroom studies with practical work experienceThe UPEI Co-op Program is an integrated approach to university education which enables students to alternate academic terms on campus with work terms in suitable employment. The success of such programs is founded on the principle that students are able to apply theoretical knowledge from course studies in the workplace and return to the classroom with practical workplace experience. Students who successfully complete all the requirements of the program will have the notation entered on their transcripts and on the graduation parchment.
Students accepted into the program, complete at least three paid work terms of normally 14 weeks duration, and three professional development courses. Credits earned through completion of work terms are counted as general electives.
The Co-op option is available to full-time students in the Chemistry Major or Honours program Applications to the Co-op Education Program are normally made after completion of the first year of study. Credits earned through completion of work terms are counted as general electives.
Visit the Co-operative Education Program website for more information.
