Missouri River
The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles (3,767 km) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km2), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.
For over 12,000 years, people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed, most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the Great Plains. The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century, and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before finally becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri was long believed to be part of the Northwest Passage – a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific – but when Lewis and Clark became the first to travel the river's entire length, they confirmed the mythical pathway to be no more than a legend.

Missouri
Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state located in the Midwestern United States. It is the 21st most extensive, and the 18th most populous of the fifty states. The state comprises 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis.
As defined by the 2010 US census, the four largest urban areas in order of population are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The mean center of the United States population at the 2010 census was in the town of Plato in Texas County.
The state's capital is Jefferson City. The land that is now Missouri was acquired from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase and became known as the Missouri Territory. Part of this territory was admitted into the union as the 24th state on August 10, 1821.
Missouri's geography is highly varied. The northern part of the state lies in dissected till plains and the southern portion lies in the Ozark Mountains (a dissected plateau), with the Missouri River dividing the regions. The state lies at the intersection of the three greatest rivers of the United States, with the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers near St. Louis, and the confluence of the Ohio River with the Mississippi north of the Bootheel. The starting points for the Pony Express, Santa Fe Trail, and Oregon Trail were all located in Missouri as well.

Missouri (band)
Missouri is a rock band from Kansas City, Missouri, known primarily for the song "Movin' On".
History
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ron West was part of a well-remembered Kansas City band, The Chesmann, with his two brothers Gary and Steve. Heavily inspired by British invasion groups, the band played both live covers and recorded original studio material. Gary West was also a member of the band Shooting Star, which scored several modest AOR hits in the late 1970 and early 1980s.
Led by Ron West, the band's self-titled first album was released in 1977 on a label called Panama Records. Even though Panama was an independent label, the band garnered substantial airplay on American FM AOR radio stations, specifically with the track "Movin On". Missouri's first gig was opening for Firefall in Emporia, Kansas. Missouri toured nationally with many major label acts such as Ted Nugent, Golden Earring, among many others.
A second album, "Welcome Two Missouri", was released on the larger and international Polydor label in 1979, including a re-recorded version of "Movin On" minus the original intro. By this time two of the original line up had dropped out. No further recordings except a repackaging of recordings from the previous albums called the best of Missouri. Missouri songs are available on iTunes.

Missouri wine
Missouri Wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Missouri. German immigrants in the early-to-mid-19th century, founded the wine industry in Missouri, resulting in its wine corridor being called the Missouri "Rhineland". Later Italian immigrants also entered wine production. In the mid-1880s, more wine was produced by volume in Missouri than in any other state. Before Prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the nation. Missouri had the first area recognized as a federally designated American Viticultural Area with  the Augusta AVA acknowledged on June 20, 1980.  There are now four AVAs in Missouri. In 2009 there were 92 wineries operating in the state of Missouri.
History
Some Native American tribes cultivated local varieties of grapes. These species were developed further by later German Americans and Italian Americans.
German immigrants to the Missouri River valley established vineyards and wineries on both sides of the river. Hermann, Missouri, settled by Germans in 1837, had ideal conditions to grow grapes for wine. By 1848 winemakers there produced 10,000 US gallons (37,900 l) per year, expanding to 100,000 US gallons (378,500 l) per year by 1856.  Overall, the state produced 2,000,000 US gallons (7,570,800 l) per year by the 1880s, the most of any state in the nation.Stone Hill Winery in Hermann became the second largest in the nation (and the third largest in the world), shipping a million barrels of wine by the turn of the 20th century.  Its wines won awards at world fairs in Vienna in 1873 and Philadelphia in 1876.

The true source of the Missouri river, Montana-Idaho, USA
The source of a large river system, for example, the Missouri-Mississippi river, the largest in the United States, is often taken as the location of the uppermost spring in the farthest tributary. Under this optic, the source of the Missouri river would be Brower's Spring (Fig. 2), located in the headwaters of Hell Roaring Creek, in southwestern Montana. The spring is named after Jacob V. Brower, who in 1896 declared it to be the source of the Missouri river in his book The Missouri river and its utmost source. However, the name Brower's Spring is not listed as an official name on the Geographic Names Information System maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey.

Why Has the Missouri River Near Kansas City Changed So Much? | #curiousKC
The Missouri River has had a long and winding history. Today not as much.
Rebecca Nunn wondered why. She rode a boat on the Missouri River when she was young. Today she works at the Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport. All that exposure to the river that runs through us prompted Nunn to ask our curiousKC team why and how the route of the river changed over time.

The source of a large river system, for example, the Missouri-Mississippi river, the largest in the United States, is often taken as the location of the uppermost spring in the farthest tributary. Under this optic, the source of the Missouri river would be Brower's Spring (Fig. 2), located in the headwaters of Hell Roaring Creek, in southwestern Montana. The spring is named after Jacob V. Brower, who in 1896 declared it to be the source of the Missouri river in his book The Missouri river and its utmost source. However, the name Brower's Spring is not listed as an official name on the Geographic Names Information System maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey.

Every river carries a million stories. Last fall, filmmaker Hunter Weeks spent 24 hours on the Missouri River, and this short film is a snapshot of life in the Gates of the Mountains section on the Mighty Mo, told in the meandering and unpredictable style of moving water itself.

The Missouri River has had a long and winding history. Today not as much.
Rebecca Nunn wondered why. She rode a boat on the Missouri River when she was young. Today she works at the Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport. All that exposure to the river that runs through us prompted Nunn to ask our curiousKC team why and how the route of the river changed over time.

Missouri River
The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles (3,767 km) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km2), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.
For over 12,000 years, people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed, most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the Great Plains. The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century, and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before finally becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri was long believed to be part of the Northwest Passage – a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific – but when Lewis and Clark became the first to travel the river's entire length, they confirmed the mythical pathway to be no more than a legend.
