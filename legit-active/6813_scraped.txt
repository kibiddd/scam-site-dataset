Rose Tree Cottage isTwenty years ago, on a Rose Tree safari, we made our first visit to a Primary School in Kenya - soon to become known as âOur Schoolâ.  Bearing books, we were greeted by  children in the courtyard â treated like royalty!Â  The dancing, singing and smiles of these children won our hearts.  Concern for their learning environment won our concern. On return to California, we could not get the school out of our minds.Â  After deciding how we could help, the first thing to be done was to fill the potholes in the classrooms.Â From potholes to providing further education for students leaving primary school, we have grown into a charity affecting over 1000 young lives and their families.The Rose Tree Cottage African childrenâs foundation,Â Bloom Where Planted,Â is a 501 (c)(3) Public Charity,Photo by Seline AwinoThe Legendary AGAEnter TextThe Rolls-Royce of Stoves...From SCONES to souffles  to stews to stir frys, it cooks everything to perfection.
