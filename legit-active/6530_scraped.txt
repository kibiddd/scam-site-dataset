Early Electronic Television
The 1939 New York World's Fair
RCA introduced television to the American public at the 1939 World's Fair. Before
the fair, they published a brochure for
their dealers to explain television.
The opening ceremony and events at the fair were televised, and NBC began regularly scheduled broadcasts. President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the fair, thereby becoming the first president to be televised.

TRK-12s were on display for viewers to see television. These sets used
voltage doublers to power the CRTs with about 10 kv to produce a
brighter picture than the sets sold to the public.
In order to convince skeptical visitors that
the TV set was not a trick, one set was made with a transparent case so that the internal components could be seen. As part of the
exhibit, visitors could see
themselves on television, and were give a card documenting the event.

Other manufacturers had television demonstrations, including General Electric, which demonstrated its own sets; ; General Motors, which had a picturephone on display, and Crosley, which demonstrated
DuMont sets and a DuMont camera. Westinghouse, which had sets
on display made for them by RCA, also had a RCA camera where visitors could be televised.
The following is from  "Television in the World of
Tomorrow", by Iain Baird, ECHOES, Winter, 1997:
Manufacturers other than RCA exhibited their television
receivers at the 1939 World's Fair. In 1938, Allen B. DuMont
Laboratories, established by the inventor and entrepreneur of the
same name, had already offered the first electronic TV sets for sale
to the public (prior to the Fair) with their 180 model. Westinghouse
Electric and General Electric offered competing production lines of
consumer televisions in their own pavillions. These companies also
built studios with live cameras for interviews. Even Ford Motor Company got into the
act, with television receivers in their executive lounge.
Conspicuously missing was Farnsworth Television. Although Philo T.
Farnsworth was the first to demonstrate electronic television
technology in 1927, his company was not yet manufacturing commercial
television receivers.
These pictures of the screen of a TRK-12 were taken in 1940 of
NBC programming.

A photograph of an early telecast from the 1939 Worlds Fair
Stanley Jay, an early Columbus, Ohio
television experimenter, took photographs of programming at the fair. Dan
Fleming, a West Virginia resident, spent much of the summers of 1939
and 1940 at the fair, where his father worked. Another family recorded a 78 rpm disk at the fair. A
woman in Portland, Oregon sent us this account of her father at the fair. Here is  a short
film showing the RCA television
pavilion.
The Fair continued in 1940. RCA put television receivers in the ocean
liner President Roosevelt, so passengers could watch the  opening
ceremonies on May 17:
