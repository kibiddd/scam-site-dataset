What travelers are sayingSara OColorado Springs, CO104 contributions05.0 of 5 bubblesFascinating and Modern World War I MuseumThis is an incredibly interesting and modern museum filled with fascinating exhibits, photos, and historical insights. The well-produced films provide a great understanding of what the battles of World War I were like. One of the most impressive features is the model beneath the theater screen, which realistically depicts the battlefield and defensive positions.This museum is a must-visit, not just for history enthusiasts. I highly recommend it to everyone! After exploring the exhibits, be sure to walk to the area where the tower is located to enjoy a stunning view of Kansas City.Another highlight is the interactive multimedia game about how different military units communicated fun and educational!Read moreReview of: National WWI Museum and MemorialWritten March 18, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It tells the story of a Missouri River steamboat that sank and then was dug up decades later in a field after the river had shifted course.  The museum has a good mix of video story telling, items on display, pictures, and placards to read.  The displays of items were extremely aesthetically pleasing in how they were laid out:  bunches of skeleton keys fanned out in a circle, porcelain buttons grouped into little dishes by color, etc.  The overwhelming amount of stuff they recovered was less overwhelming to view because of how well it was laid out, but you still got the point about how much they found.The staff were very friendly and helpful, happy to chat about the exhibit and the restoration work still being done on various items from the steamboat.Assume at least 2 hours if you want to watch all the videos and read all the explanations.It's not suited for small children, but school-age kids who are curious and like to read will enjoy it.Food and most beverages are not allowed, but there a some restaurants in walking distance.We parked at Union Station and rode the free streetcar over and back.Read moreReview of: Arabia Steamboat MuseumWritten February 15, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My catalytic converter was stolen (2 0r 3 years ago) as well as my friends was stolen also at the same time.! Also closes and locks doors at midnight and nowhere to wait inside for an early train departure. Or a late arrival. Need more assistance for riders getting off train.

The animals were all very well cared for, and the vast majority were easy to see.  They have quite a few animals to see. The aquarium was very nice.  There were easy walk paths to get around on if you want to walk.  There is also different forms of transportation to get you around the zoo.  The food was good.  The entire staff was super friendly. The zoo was very clean.There were only 2 reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars.  1) They don't have any really "wow" species.  The Atlanta Zoo is much smaller, but they have pandas and a Komodo dragon.  2) They don't have any opportunities to interact with any of the animals. Many people would pay good money to be paired with a zoo keeper for a day.  They explained that the giraffe species they have don't respond well to human interactions, but having opportunities to feed the elephants,seal lions or penguins would engage the patrons, if done correctly could be an enriching experience for the animals and bring in a bunch of funding for the zoo and conservation projects. Bottom line, I loved my day here.  I will be back. I highly recommend the Kansas City Zoo.Read moreReview of: Kansas City Zoo & AquariumWritten July 15, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Royals are working hard to secure a new stadium at another site.  To me, that would be a shame.  The K is a gorgeous stadium.  The fountains, scoreboard, and great sight lines make this a great place to see a ballgame.  The food and drink options highlight the local food specialties nicely.  There are numerous chances to have some Kansas City BBQ.This is one of the best stadiums for kids in my opinion.  There are numerous things for kids to do.  There are also many food/drink spots with kid friendly options.If the Royals succeed in securing a new stadium you will want to get a visit to this grand old stadium before it closes.Read moreReview of: Kauffman StadiumWritten November 18, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
