Humanity  Mayor Sly James at the Plaza on Saturday Night			 Kansas City Mayor Sly James visited the Country Club Plaza Saturday evening in an effort to address the problem of underage loitering and flash mobs that have started to take place in the past year on the Plaza. I followed Mayor Sly around for the evening and snapped some photos of him talking with people, including many of the underage kids who are being dropped off by their parents for hours at a time on the Plaza and left to their own devices.
In a terrible twist of timing, three young people were shot and wounded on the Plaza very near the Mayor after I had departed and gone home. Word has it that the Mayor was taken to the ground by his security contingent for his own protection as the shots rang out. Click here for the article at the Kansas City Star. All nine of the following photos were taken before the night turned ugly.

Nice “before” shots Eric.  You should have done an “after” set of all the chaos, one of Sly laying in the bushes. Can’t blame you for not wanting to stick around dodging bullets though.
