Review: Wild West - The Essential Western Film Music Collection, The
by David A. Koran June 23, 20014 / 5 Stars
It’s been a pretty full year for movie theme compilations,
and just about every record company has had their fingers in the pie.
Silva has been leading the pack by putting out variously themed
compilations during the 90s like The Crimson Pirate, Cinema Choral
Classics, and The Mark Of Zorro. Out of all of those
previous releases, someone at Silva has finally put all that
experience to good use with their release of The Wild West: The
Essential Western Film Music Collection. I have to admit I’m
kind of a western buff, both in movies but also the lore and pure
ruggedness of the western United States. The selections presented
here are some of the best samplings of music written for film and
television dealing with that subject, a true cross section of what
makes the west so appealing for filmmakers and the audience.
It’s true that some more enduring themes in music, and film
music more specifically, are from westerns like The Magnificent
Seven, A Fistfull of Dollars, The Professionals,
and The Big Country, and rightly so, since never has a musical
genre encompassed describing so perfectly the character of the people
and landscape and environments they inhabit like the western.
Just about any film composer worth their weight in the last 75
years has written music for a western. From the golden age like
Dimitri Tionmkin, Max Steiner,and Alfred Newman to some of the more
current composers of James Newton Howard, Randy Newman, and Basil
Poledouris, each has made their mark and each are represented by some
of their best and most memorable work on this two CD set. It’s
truly hard to cover all the music represented here on the set, since
each piece has its own strengths and power. Some of the music, such
as Gettysburg Glory, and The Last Of The
Mohicans have now direct classification as westerns, but their
music was written in the spirit of the west. Some of my favorites on
the album are from true westerns, however, like The Big
Country, Dances With Wolves, and the great How The West
Was Won, presented here with relative closeness to the original
recordings, this time as with most Silva compilations played by The
City of Prague Philharmonic. It seems that this orchestra, under the
tutelage of Nic Raine, Paul Bateman and Derek Wadsworth, has
increased their overall skill with reproducing the original sound of
the scores, a rare feat nowadays for special product compilations.
Overall, I’d rate this as one of Silva’s best releases,
and definitely their best compilation. For those who need to get a
sampling of this branch of film music, or this type of music in
general, it’s the best starting point. I’ve even been
inspired by some of these recordings to search out the full scores to
several of the movies and television shows heard here. Some have
never seen full score recording before, and hopefully Silva or some
other company will be inspired to possibly do so, it really
can’t hurt, it’s a neglected film genre nowadays (The
Wild Wild West from Barry Sonnenfeld did not count this
year... and may have actually hurt those prospects.) Run, do not
walk, do not pass go, to your local record store and pick up this
release, you won’t be disappointed!
