I enjoyed this one better than She Smells the Dead because the plot in this one was fantastic and I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough. Spirit Storm picks up right where the 1st book left off and starts off with a bang in the beginning, Yuki is about to steal something from some witches…what? Yep, the spunky little goth girl might be getting herself into some trouble!*Contains slight Spoilers from Book 1 beyond this point*Someone is killing innocents and not just the normal kind of innocents; they are members of Calvin’s pack. Yuki and the gang jump into action to solve who is killing the wolves and why, but they have another problem with Halloween coming up the means spirits will follow. Meaning Yuki has to prepare herself for the dead start walking the land.I loved the gang this time around Emma is forever one of my favorites because her snarky comebacks and bickering with Simon crack me up. Not to mention how much I love Simon, I’m so curious about him now that I know more about his past. I might be wrong but I really felt that in this book Simon and Emma’s tension was heading towards being more the frenemies, a possible romance later in the series?? Ha ha that might just be my wishful thinking. The relationship with Calvin and Yuki develops wonderfully in this book, adding bits of tension and worry for the adorable couple. I enjoy that they are still learning about their connection to each other and that Stevens is taking her time with letting her characters explore their abilities more and learn from each other. I’m so very interested on how much more powerful Yuki can get or if she will get more powerful. The plot was really what drew me into this book till the last page, I don’t want to give away too much but I loved the twist and turns that occurred. My emotions changed with each scene from surprise, worry, excitement and laughing. This book just had so much that I loved. I cant wait to see what’s next for this group and what challenges they will have to face. I highly recommend this series for its humor, mystery, definitely the romance and the characters are just awesome! RECOMMENDATION:This is a Young Adult novel suited for any age. Fans of Rachel Hawkins A Hex Hall Series and Lauren Kate’s Fallen Series will love this!ghosts magical romance ...more7 likesLike CommentTanya231 reviews6 followersFollowFollowJune 26, 2011I enjoyed this second book in E.J.'s series. I just really enjoy the characters...everyone has such a different personality. I could read about these characters for a long time and hopefully E.J. keeps writing about them as they grow together with all their gifts. I also enjoyed all the explanations about Samhain and the traditions. I really did not know a whole lot behind Halloween and what it meant...now I do. I'd like to see one of the characters have a happy ending....no names to spoil though. I adore Yuki's vegan friend...hilarious. This is a very good YA series but now it's time for me to go to an adult book ;) then back to YA...lol I would love to see *cough, cough* more Cal but it is YA...lots of kissing is yummy too =)6 likesLike CommentJenny (Books that Spark)109 reviews7 followersFollowFollowDecember 30, 2011Spirit Storm is the second instalment in the Spirit Guide book series by E. J. Stevens. This Young Adult Paranormal series follows the adventures of protagonist Yuki and friends as they attempt to cope with a lot of supernatural happenings.Spirit Storm, alike to it's predecessor She Smells the Dead, is told from the first person perspective of Yuki. Yuki is a strong protagonist whom is both entertaining and believable. She has a gift and it's not necessarily one she loves; she can smell the dead. She experiences 'smell impressions' of souls who have passed on but need closure in order to go into the light. That's where Yuki comes in; she has to help them find their closure. The 'smell impressions' distract her from everyday life and sometimes even make her feel uncomfortable.So it's understandable that she feels apprehensive and afraid that Samhain is fast approaching. Samhain is the night when the veil between the worlds is at it's thinnest and thus spirits can cross over to the world and it's Yuki who these souls will come to.Time is running out for Yuki and her friends to find a solution to help her survive Samhain and it's not only Yuki who has problems to deal with. First of all there's Cal. Cal is the love of Yuki's life and also werewolf. He and fellow werewolf friend Simon have a barbaric werewolf killer to find before the killer finds them. Secondly, there's Yuki's BFF Emma. She's got boy troubles to deal with.The aspect of this series I love the most is the characters. Stevens has created an interesting, unique bunch of characters. I can imagine these characters to become even stronger as the series progresses. Yuki and Cal's relationship is compelling to read about. In some respects, I feel as though I'm going through their relationship with them. I've said it before but I'll say it again: these two have the potential to be a power couple in literature. This instalment also peeked my interest in Emma and Simon as a couple. It hasn't happened but the chemistry is there and I can only hope!The plot is fast-paced and full of plenty of action which allows it to be a page-turner. I read Spirit Storm in one sitting as I couldn't bare to put it down. I definitely recommend this book and the series as a whole for fans of the paranormal genre. After completion, I developed the feeling of loss I get when I want to read the next instalment right away. It comes out in Fall 2011 - I can't wait! A thoroughly enjoyable read from my new favourite Author, E. J. Stevens.read-in-20115 likesLike CommentTheBookAddictedGirl279 reviews242 followersFollowFollowSeptember 29, 20114½ Out of 5 StarsYuki is special: she can smell the dead. She is also running out of time. Samhain is fast approaching – as is the storm of spirits it will bring with it. Yuki needs to find a way to get through the night. Preferably with her sanity. To make everything worse, a murderer is out there – a murderer who seems to be targeting werewolves. And then, just when Yuki is starting to think that her life cannot get any better, a disaster strikes. And still, time is running out. On the bright side, she’s found something to deal with her ghosty problems. The downside? It involves stealing. From witches. Wonderful, just wonderful…Oh, how I missed Yuki! Which proves how addictive this series is, seeing as I read Spirit Storm straight after I finished She Smells the Dead, but there you go. And what a wonderful sequel! It was just as quirky, cute, fun and such a pageturner! I found myself sitting in bed, my kindle on my lap, reading way into the wee hours. I love this series! Vanessa Stennings, more commonly known as Yuki, was just as wonderful as she was in the first book! She had the craziest ideas (wearing a shirt full of safety pins to keep the spirits away. Who else?), as well as being insanely excitable and energetic. Her dress sense: amazingly wacky, featuring gourd spiders and shoulder-bag pumpkin ghosts. And they were called Legs and Boo. Don’t you just love her already? She’s so cute, hilarious, and her wonderful madness was just contagious! Calvin Miller was amazing. And also an alpha wolf. Basically, he says “jump”, the other wolves say “how high”. He, too, was wonderfully mad. And adorable. He was so brave and strong: just what Yuki needed. And, I can tell you now, that Cal and Yuki were the cutest. Ever. They’re soulmates, but it actually works. Cal’s soul is special: he has a spirit wolf. And Yuki’s just plain special: hence, she smells the dead. So, really, it’s more spirit mates. Either way, they’re adorable. So, so, so, so, so cute! It also felt wonderfully real, all the way through the book. It was the light in the spirity dark.Emma was officially the best friend ever! She was totally sweet and the “normal” thing grounding Yuki. Plus she was completely addicted to research – how completely weird? And she Training to be a vet, Emma named her cats Van Gogh and Chairman Meow! Plus, I love her diabolical plans…!Simon was kind of a jerk. He was also sarcastic and very funny. And a wolf. An old one! Seriously, he was born with the wolf spirit. Which meant he was kind of, in Yuki’s own words, “off”. He was, uh, “ancient”. Y’know. Thirty! Man. In the first five pages: a murder! That is just how I like my thrillers! And a deranged, symbolic, werewolf-hating murder? Does it get any better? Yes. When you throw in ghosts, eminent danger and a brilliantly wacky heroine. I adore E.J.’s writing and plot, even if some parts felt a little skipped-over, a little anti-climatic. But the ending? Wow. Let’s just say, if I didn’t already have the third book, there’d be a pretty impressive chance that I’d lose my sanity! Plus, on a completely unrelated topic, isn’t this cover just the most beautiful thing ever?action-adventure amazing-worlds cover-crazy ...more4 likesLike CommentKaty1,293 reviews302 followersFollowFollowSeptember 6, 2013Book Info: Genre: Urban FantasyReading Level: Young AdultRecommended for: Fans of YA fiction, esp. paranormal and urban fantasy, those interested in ghosts and spirits.My Thoughts: In this second book in the Spirit Guide series, after She Smells the Dead, Yuki works to prepare herself for the spirit storm that will accompany Samhain. To complicate matters, someone appears to be hunting werewolves.One of the things I like about this series is it is fairly realistic (within certain definitions of reality) about how life progresses. I would not be in the least bit surprised to find some people complaining that it is “boring” or “too slow,” but I actually liked the pacing. The ending was a bit of an anticlimax, but again, I found it to be realistic – and a beautiful affirmation about spirit, too.I enjoyed this story, and am looking forward to book three, The Legend of Witchtrot Road. Watch for my review!Disclosure: I received this book as part of an omnibus, including the first three books in the Spirit Guide series, from the author in exchange for an honest review.Synopsis: "Let the spirits guide you, but never let them take you."Spirits of the Dead are coming...Yuki is about to face an army of lost souls on Samhain, the night of Halloween, when the spirits of the dead roam free.

With great friends surrounding and supporting her, Yuki still has to deal with snide putdowns from some snooty highschool classmates, but she manages stay true to her own unique self even under duress. I enjoyed her attire choices in the first book and once again found myself grinning and mentally picturing her get-ups in this book. Her clothing accessories, while odd, make perfect sense, once she explains.This is another “feel-good” read that is masterfully told, with witty, often humorous, dialogues and action scenes. I do have some concerns about possible repercussions from, what I consider to be a brilliantly executed though ill-advised venture, on the wrong side of the law, and against a powerful sect, but I am pretty sure my concerns will be addressed in the next installment of Spirit Guide adventures that should be released later this year. Again, this fabulous adventure should appeal not only to young adults but to anyone who likes characters with grit and charisma who strive always to overcome adversity – characters that will touch your heart and gladden your soul. adventure contemporary fiction ...more4 likesLike CommentRobert DuperreAuthor 26 books106 followersFollowFollowFebruary 23, 2011Rating: 4.5 out of 5It looks like my newfound love of paranormal romance will continue, and I can pretty much blame it on one of my new favorite authors, E.J. Stevens.A couple months ago, when I read She Smells the Dead, the first book in her series, I wrote that the innocent and almost ideal aspects of the relationships between the characters appealed to me the most. It reminded me of my own youth – actually, reminded me how lacking in sincerity my own youth was – and left me grinning by the end.Well, with Spirit Storm, Stevens has raised the bar…in that category and just about everywhere else.We start out where SStD leaves off. Yuki, our heroine who receives “smell impressions” from the dead, is busy preparing herself, in both mind and body, for Samhain (aka Halloween), when spirits enter the world in overwhelming numbers and could potentially drive her crazy, or worse. She is assisted by her werewolf boyfriend Cal, Simon, Cal’s werewolf mentor, and Emma, Yuki’s best friend/vegan/animal rights activist/all around spitfire. It would be all well and good if all this group had to do was prepare for the horrors of that night. But no, fate intercedes with a tragedy: a member of Cal’s pack has been murdered by a werewolf-hater and the ghost of the dead man now haunts Yuki, urging her to help put his soul to rest. And then another werewolf is kidnapped, potentially by the same person. The small group of four is put on the case, future obstacles be damned. Can’t a girl get a break? It’s not like she doesn’t have enough to deal with.Add to this to the stresses between Emma and Simon (they really don’t get along, though the text makes you wonder if there might be a hidden attraction that slips between the cracks during their fights) along with the pressure Cal is under now that it’s been revealed to his hidden society that he is the alpha male, and therefore leader of the pack by birthright, and we have a recipe for potentially overwhelming these poor, loveable young people.Luckily, they’re up for the challenge.The plot of this book is really quite simple and straightforward. As with SStD, the dialogue is impeccable and the story flows as smooth as any you’ve ever read. There are no dull moments, and even the dream sequences, which in the first book seemed to come from left field a couple times (which is appropriate, actually, seeing as that book served as an introduction, and those dreams ways to extrapolate on the functionality of the mythology presented), serve to heighten the tension this time around. The characters are idealized versions of teenagers yet completely believable, especially if you allow the language to take you on the magical ride it has to offer. Also, the author has curtailed her penchant for inserting Yuki’s thoughts into the story. Instead of being redundant this time around, they’re funny and poignant, which is a great improvement.Perhaps what Spirit Storm does best, however, is something more mundane, more easily overlooked, especially when dealing with teenage romance. Stevens drives home the point that Yuki and Cal are soulmates throughout the story, and yet there are subtler tones there as well that bode well for future conflict. The author, while at times idealizing their behavior, doesn’t allow that to make them caricatures of young love. Instead, she inserts a rather brilliant thread involving the dangers of being too close, too young. In this way, she’s telling us that although these two wonderful creatures belong together, things don’t always end up the way we think they should. She’s careful to let her audience know that these are still children, that there will be other choices, other paths, other dangers, presented to them as time goes on. The risk comes from obsession, from thinking a situation to be too good to be true. She warns against holding on to this love, even if it might hurt to let go, because in life, when things go bad, the hurt and pain will do nothing but drag you into a deeper well of despair, the full cost of which may actually be a loss of self or identity.As I said, this point isn’t preached about, but it’s there. And this line of reasoning is pressed up against the more surface themes of the work – responsibility, morality, and loyalty. This is illustrated wonderfully when the characters finally come face-to-face with the werewolf killer, himself. I won’t get into the particulars, but it was quite refreshing to see that a simplistic tale such as this, which often can veer into absolute shades of black and white, took the opportunity to splash massive amounts of gray on the landscape. What makes us who we are, the story asks. And who is to blame when we discover that those we’ve judged have reasons beyond our capacity to understand for acting and thinking the way they do, that their lives, and their actions, are the result of a cacophony of unfortunate life experiences? The book offers no answers to this question, only begs for forgiveness, for patience, for perspective. In this regard, I’ll even go out on a limb and say that this book may not only be an outlet for entertainment, but a teaching tool for the young, as well. It has something to say, after all, and it states its message with class and respect.Now I have to be honest here and say that I was this close to giving Spirit Storm only the third perfect scoreI’ve ever handed out. By the time I reached the last page, however, I discovered that I couldn’t. For as wonderful as the first ninety percent of the book is, I found the last bit a little…unsatisfactory. Again, I won’t go into detail, but there is a huge buildup to a climax that never seemed to come. I’ll leave this open to interpretation by the rest of you readers out there, because I’m only one man and perhaps I’m saddled with a need for action and resolution. Perhaps others will see the ending differently, perhaps they’ll find it perfect for the story it has to tell. But for this reviewer, it was slightly disappointing.However, with that being said, the points I dock for this are minimal. The rest of the book is fabulous. More than anything, it is beautiful in both style and substance. It’s a quick read, and I continued to fall in love with the characters and root for them to succeed, both at the tasks at hand and at love, as the layers that make them who they are get pulled back. The romance between Yuki and Cal is refreshingly innocent yet needy, and it’s interesting to think about whether they’ll be able to grow as people or if they’ll find their only distinguishing characteristics are each other. This is a story of perseverance and devotion, both to loved ones and community, and still makes sure to let you know that there are pressures, both internal and external, that wish to rip apart everything they’ve built.What else can I say? I adored this book, ending be damned. It deserves to be up there in the pantheon of new PR releases, right alongside Amanda Hocking, another of my favorites in the genre. I know I will be passing both Spirit Storm and She Smells the Dead down to my daughter, and I will feel confident in doing so; confident that the messages she receives from the words Stevens has put down on paper will enlighten, amuse, and most important of all, make her think.That’s really all you can ask for.Plot - 10Characters - 10Voice - 9Execution - 7Personal Enjoyment – 9Overall – 45/50 (4.5/5)3 likes2 commentsLike CommentGigi77713 reviews2 followersFollowFollowFebruary 23, 2011In the world of the paranormal, the imagination reigns supreme. Populated by mysterious supernatural beings, and mortals possessing extraordinary powers, Spirit Storm by E.J. Stevens, is an enchanting tale that transports the reader to an intriguing realm of spirits, werewolves and murder. This is the second installment of her fascinating Spirit Guide Series.  Yuki is a High School Senior with a unique psychic awareness. SHE SMELLS THE DEAD. Actually, they come in the form of “smell impressions” according to Calvin Miller, her Alpha male soul mate. Both Yuki and Calvin have totems who guide them in their lives. Yuki has a special calling, which is to lead lost souls to the light, but she must be careful; there are angry spirits as well. She learns that on Samhain, the night of Halloween, the spirits of the dead roam free. Samhain is nigh upon her, and the veil begins to thin. Yuki and her friend Emma race frantically in search of an ancient amulet. The metal will guard her against the spirit horde. However, there is a slight problem. The amulet is in the possession of a witch. Yuki is in grave danger.  Meanwhile, a young werewolf from Calvin’s pack is discovered heinously murdered. He and his second in command, Simon, begin searching for the madman. Yuki has a brilliant idea of how they might find the killer and begins a research at the school library. She wants to know how to kill a werewolf. Yuki asks the librarian if anyone has been checking out books on the same subject. Suddenly, a person races right past Yuki. The librarian informs her that the racing individual was looking into the same subject matter as well. Did Yuki just cross paths with the werewolf killer? Yuki must prepare for the bombardment of angry spirits who threaten to steal her mind. Calvin is needed to find the werewolf killer and end the loss of life. Will her soul mate be there for her when she needs him the most? Yuki knows that death is not the worst thing this spirit horde is capable of. The storm is coming. There will be no escaping it.  Ms. Stevens is a writer who chooses a large canvas and fills it to the edges. She exquisitely balances the various plot threads, while maintaining gripping suspense, mystery, humor, romance, and simmering tension. Calvin and Yuki are the primary characters in Spirit Storm, and Ms. Stevens develops them beautifully. The story is told from Yuki’s perspective, and flows smoothly from start to finish. The novel is fast paced and highly entertaining. I enjoyed Yuki and Emma’s vegan inspired rants, Simon teasing Yuki, and Yuki firing back by calling him an “old man”. I adored Yuki and Calvin. Their love and devotion for each other was deep and heart felt. It was very inspiring. I believe the fascinating terrain of this tale is the question of how and why people decide to care as they do.  I highly recommend Spirit Storm to anyone looking to experience a thrilling paranormal ride through intriguing mystery, heart pounding suspense, and the pain and joy of true love. I can’t wait to see what Ms. Stevens has in store in the third book of the Spirit Guide series. The Legend of Witchtrot Road is due to release fall 2011. Be prepared to be enchanted by Spirit Storm. Here is an admirable story of love and wonder.

Stevens’ Spirit Guide Series and it just keeps getting better. Yuki, Cal, Emma and Simon are back with their weird mixture of gifts and problems. When the book opens it’s October 30 in Salem Massachusetts and Yuki is getting ready to break into an occult shop run by witches. We go back to October 20th in Maine to find out how this strange event has come about. Yuki and Cal are in the parking lot of school when Cal receives a picture on his cell phone from Simon of a dead wolf who is a member of Cal’s pack. During the course of the book another pack member is abducted and the gang have to figure out who is doing this. To add to their problems, Yuki is gearing up for Samham, Halloween night, when the spirits of the dead run free. Not a good thing for someone who can smell the dead. Emma has developed the odd ability of snakes talking to her and she isn’t pleased. Yuki is also smelling the dead, who she is assuming might be their first victim. How will they get through all their trials and how does Yuki end up breaking into an occult shop? These questions and more are answered in this action packed fun read.There are times you read the first book in a series and think to yourself, I wonder how the author is going to top that? Unfortunately, most of the time they don’t, the second book of the series is just not as good as the first. That is not the case here, Spirit Storm is just as good, if not better than She Smells The Dead. The kids are handling more issues this time, and handling them with maturity and humor. Yuki learns to connect with her spirit guide, the dung beetle (I kid you not), and with it’s help learns how to connect with Cal’s wolf better. Simon and Emma play a huge role in helping out Yuki and Cal and along the way we get more insight into their personalities. The humor from the first book is carried over into this book and I found myself chuckling more than once at some of the scenes. I have to admit, I have a little crush on Simon and am I seeing something develop between him and Emma? The bond between these four people is a strong one and they work well together. This book is technically for Young Adults but actually all ages will enjoy reading it. There is no strong language, although we do have Yuki’s favorite expletive “son of a dung beetle” still occurring. Everyone is now able to raise one eyebrow except Yuki, I’ve tried, it’s hard to do. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good story with a few laughs, a good mystery, some mystic happenings and some strange spirit guides.3 likesLike CommentAvery328 reviews90 followersFollowFollowJune 23, 2011Well E.J. Stevens has done it again! Written a book which instantly hooks the reader and reels them in. Again, Yuki is a really intriguing character, Cal is swoon-worthy, and the tempo of the book is very fast paced, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat the entire time. What is even better about this book than its predecessor is that the secondary characters, Emma and Simon, make such a profound impact upon us. Their bantering back and forth was so entertaining and truly the cherry on top of this book (and dare I say it, though I know that there is a bit of an age difference between them, I wouldn't mind seeing them together together in the next book of the series). One thing about this book that I did find to be a bit of a booger was Cal's condition, the boy is forever being beat up in some way, shape, or form. He really deserves a break (oh, and to be concious the entire book so that we can experience even more of his swoon-worthiness)! But then again, I guess that we have to consideration the fact that Cal is really stepping up as a Alpha and in doing so, one is bound to face some challenges and opposition. All in all, this is a great addition to E.J. Steven's "Spirit Guide" series! It is evident that E.J. is really developing as an author with each installment of this series- I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us in the next book in the series (slated to be released this fall), "Legend of Witchtrot Road". 3 likesLike CommentMelissa 644 reviews59 followersFollowFollowJune 6, 2011
Yuki and friends are back in this second installment of the Spirit Guide series. With the spirit storm approaching, Yuki and her friends have their hands full, but when a member of Calvin's pack is murdered and another disappears, Yuki and the gang have no choice, but to investigate. Hoping at the same time they can prepare Yuki for the upcoming onslaught of spirits.
I love this series. This is the second book in the Spirit Guide series and it looks like there are more to come. (I can't wait!) I love Yuki and her lovable friends. These are fast easy relaxing reads with a very interesting story.Overall, a great addition to the series. One not for readers who haven't read this series, you might find yourself a little lost if you read these out of order. You will definitely want to read the first book, She Smells the Dead before you tackle spirit storm, but don't worry--it is so worth it.

My review is my thoughts after reading both books. This is the same review that I put for She Smells the Dead.Being a teenager can suck. Being a teenager with paranormal gifts can really suck. Yuki is a Senior in high school who has an uncanny sense of smell. She smells the dead. That’s right she senses ghosts through scent. That alone makes this series interesting. In these first two books Yuki is learning about her spirit gifts. Her best friend Cal who becomes her boyfriend has his own issues that he has to work through. Together Yuki and Cal will weather anything that the spirit world has to offer. Emma is Yuki’s other best friend who brings reason and balance to Yuki. Emma is the polar opposite of Yuki from the way they dress to the way they respond to things. Simon is helping Cal as he deals with his issues. He also is there to help Yuki understand how to control her spirit gift and not let it control her. Simon is a funny, quick witted, hot guy who gets under Emma’s skin. I’m interested to see where their quips lead them.  There were many things I liked about this story. The first thing that had me loving this series was the cover art. I love the covers of both of these books. The cover for She Smells the Dead is a striking cover that features only Yuki. The cover for Spirit Storm has a little more detail that hints at what’s to come in the story. Both are simple but appealing. The story itself was an enjoyable quick read. The story is told from Yuki’s point of view but the reader gets to also witness Yuki’s inner monologue. She makes witty comments on the things she is telling to the reader. The story offers a level of mystery. Since Yuki smells the dead she doesn’t actually see them or talk to them. This makes figuring out what they want a little difficult so with the awesome research skills of her friend Emma and the internet she has resources to help her. She also is getting in tune with the spirit side and she gets clues from her dreams. I was pleasantly surprised that in the story Emma used the library for research. She scoured books and used microfiche while Yuki relied on internet. Yuki even comments that Emma was able to find more information from her research. As a teacher this bit of story detail stood out to me since I have seen the decline in research skills among students. It makes the story more believable that the characters use all resources available to help them figure things out. To add a level of reality to the story Yuki still goes to school every day even though paranormal activity is creeping up on her. There is a nice balance of reality and paranormal to make this story work. It truly is a brilliant series beginning. Book 3 is scheduled to release Fall 2011. 2 likes1 commentLike CommentJillAuthor 3 books40 followersFollowFollowJune 11, 2011E.J.'s done it again! Yuki, Cal, Simon, and Emma are at it again.

The story is told in the POV of Vanessa Stennings, better known as Yuki to her friends and family. Spirit Storm picks up shortly after She Smells the Dead left off.In summary for those who might be thinking about reading this series. Yuki has the ability to smell the dead. In the previous book, the dead she smelled was like vinegar, which lead Yuki, Emma and Calvin back to the deceased. Yuki understands that she is like a beacon of light guiding the lost souls to their final resting place. In this book, the dead smells like burned brownies, a speciality of the deceased.Yuki also found out that her boyfriend, Calvin Miller, who she didn’t really think of that way before, is a werewolf and the alpha of his pack. She even spent time with him at spirit camp where she met Simon. Simon is also were and a spirit teach for the pack who teaches her that she needs to be able to keep Calvin's wolf grounded to him. She learned that her spirit animal is the scarab, or dung beetle. A fact that she wasn't too crazy about.Emma is Yuki’s best friend and is pre-med student and a true vegan. She and Calvin battle back in forth over his desire to continue to eat meat. They both love it, and I hope it never goes away. Later, Emma learns the reason why he needs to meat to survive. Emma also learned that the pack is going to pay for her to go to veterinary school when she graduates from H.S as a thank you for saving Calvin after a mishap at a dance broke his arm. As we left the motley crew of Yuki, Calvin, Emma and Simon, they were trying to find a way to help protect Yuki from the coming of Samhain, or the Day of the Dead. It’s the one day when spirits enter our world in overwhelming numbers and could potentially drive Yuki crazy, or worse. If only things were that simple. Calvin receives a message from Simon which shows that one of his werewolves has been brutally killed by silver bullets, Wolfsbane and mistletoe. This leads to the hunt for a werewolf killer who may have been cast aside and has also kidnapped another wolf. In essence, you have three simultaneous stories that put everyone on edge. The first is finding the werewolf killer before he strikes again. Then there is the hunt for an amulet said to be made by the Sidhe and is said to protect the wearer from evil spirits. In this case, the protection is needed for Yuki to survive the night. Then there is the health of Calvin who is hurt badly, again, in a scuffle with the werewolf killer. Poor Calvin just can't seem to cut a break from the writer.The story combines love, friendship, mystery, suspense, and paranormal all into a neat little bow and delivers it to readers in a smooth and not drawn out way. This story is less than 200 pages in length which isn’t long to actually tell a story. The Good: Yuki and Emma are best friends that complement each other perfectly. Emma doesn’t care what Yuki wears and stands by her side against the J Gang who torment Yuki nonstop. Yuki is considered to be a witch by her high school mates because of the fact that she dresses in goth like clothes. That really doesn’t get to her. She seems to be grounded in her ideology, and protecting her friends, while remaining true to her core. The banter between Emma and Simon is often humorous and angry, but you just know that the two of them would do anything for the other regardless of their feelings toward the other. The love between Calvin and Yuki has definitely become stronger after Yuki dances her way through saving Calvin yet again, after he is hurt hunting the werewolf killer, and the fact that she gets a tattoo that permanently links them as soul mates.You won’t find any cursing in this book, but you will find Yuki using the slang Son of a dung beetle often. I can live with that.For the record, I received this from EJ by request, and I thank her for her personable and fast response. I love when authors take the time and actually are open to sharing their work with others. I’ve also been rather forward with my local library in requesting this series be available to other reads. Finally, we got the first two books of the series within the last week. Now, others can enjoy this series as well. So, thank you EJ. I look forward to your next book. 2011-releases y-a-paranormal1 likeLike CommentHeather484 reviews45 followersFollowFollowOctober 18, 2011This is the second book in E.J. Stevens' Spirit Guide series and it's even better than She Smells The Dead. Yuki is such a great character. She's not your typical Goth girl. She smells the imprints of the dead. And she's in love with a werewolf who is also her best friend. Oh and he's the Alpha of the pack. And she's got an outspoken militant vegan female best friend, Emma.And she's got the best assortment of boots I've ever read about in the history of YA. Oh, and she loves Cal Miller. She says that a lot and you might think that would get old, but it doesn't at all. Because it's so sweet that this tough (not really) looking Goth girl with her spikes and safety pins melts every time she sees Calvin Miller. And when he touches her or kisses her, time seems to fade for both of them. This is one of the sweetest love stories that plays out through a mystery that I have ever read. And it's very believable. They've been best friends forever and just seemed like they were always meant to be. But who knew they were actually soul mates. You need to read She Smells The Dead to read about how they become boyfriend and girlfriend.Calvin Miller smells like wet dog and sunshine, a smell that Yuki finds very appealing as opposed to the Burnt Brownie smell she's smelling at the beginning of the book, the smell imprint of a werewolf that was murdered. Yuki has to help find his killer in order to help him pass on. But in this book that's not her only problem. First Cal gets hurt in a fight with the killer and is unconscious for several days. He visits her in her dreams and he doesn't look too good. And with the coming of Samhain, Yuki will be vulnerable to all the spirits of the dead when the veil is at it's thinnest. Yuki's spirit guide, the Scarab, or more commonly known as the Dung Beetle (yes she's so lucky) warns her to "Let the spirits guide you, but never let them take you."Simon is second in command to Cal and he and Emma fight like cats and wolves. But you know how that goes. Simon is "old" in Yuki's eyes, but Emma is very responsible and mature. Still the two mix like oil and water. I'd watch that relationship though. Emma acts as pack veterinarian. She uses herbal treatments to heal when she can because the wolves can't exactly go to the vet or the hospital.There is a good bit of paranormal in this story with ghosts, spirits, werewolves and spirit guides. Witches and faeries even play a small part. From murderers, to kidnappings, to travels in the spirit realm, to a real spirit storm to stealing, Spirit Storm has it all. And as Yuki would say, "Son of a dung beetle," you'll be kicking yourself if you don't find out why she wears a safety pin shirt or what the Amulet of Nera is.This was a great second book in the Spirit Guide Series and in case you missed the pictures here's the link to pictures of Emma, Yuki, Simon, Cal and Gordy. Oh, Gordy? He's Yuki's friend from Anime club and he's dating Emma. Well he was, but he's still a part of the story. And a great friend to Yuki. So see their pictures Here and see why Yuki melts in Cal's arms and why Simon turns all the girls' heads.This isn't really a heavy series at all, but it's sweet and light and very interesting for it's paranormal content. There's nothing else like it out there. And book three, Legend of Witchtrot Road is already out and it's great. Look for my review later this week.Highly Recommended for all ages!Heather1 likeLike CommentMichaelAuthor 2 books94 followersFollowFollowFebruary 16, 2011Yuki isn't a typical high school student living in Maine. She senses and smells the spirits of the dead. She is worried that on Samhain, the night of Halloween, the dead will be free to roam and she isn't sure how she'll deal with it.Calvin Miller, Yuki's boyfriend, is the Alpha, the leader of a pack of werewolves. He and his subordinate, Simon, are attempting to find who recently killed a werewolf. They want to prevent further killing.Thinking that she has an idea that will help, Yuki stops at the library to see if anyone had been checking books on methods to kill werewolves. She crosses paths with someone rushing from the library. When the librarian tells her that this was the person looking into werewolf matters, Yuki thinks that this must have been the killer.Yuki continues to worry about Samhain but through her research, she discovers that there is an amulet that can ward off the evil spirits that arrive on Halloween night. How can she get this amulet? Will she be able to get it on time since Halloween is so near? These questions are answered in the next part of the story.Yuki's love for Calvin is well expressed. She shows that she is strony, yet vulnerable. At one point where she interreacts with Calvin's spirit, it reminded me of Claire Abshire, heroine of "The Time Traveler's Wife." Both Claire and Yuki are brought into a spirit world by meeting their respective lovers, Cal and Henry. Both young women fight to keep their love alive and overlook any oddities in their lovers' existence. They are two charming characters in two unique and memorable novels.mystery own-it read-in-2011 ...more1 likeLike CommentSally626 reviews67 followersFollowFollowAugust 29, 2011I'm loving this series!Spirit Storm is an exciting mixture of the threat of a werewolf murderer on the loose (which the gang need to track down before he can harm anyone else), and the approaching danger of Samhain- where the veil between the spirit world is at it's thinnest and therefore Yuki is most in danger of being completely overwhelmed. Her endurance is tested at the funeral of the murdered werewolf boy, where just being in a graveyard Yuki is bombarded with smell impressions, images, and the resulting migraine nearly drives her over the edge. Aware that Samhain will be ten times worse and Yuki would be lucky to survive with her mind intact the gang need to find some way to protect her mind from the approaching spirit storm. This protection takes the form of an old necklace guarded by witches, but as the friends devise a plan to steal it, Calvin is injured and all of Yuki's attention and energy focus back to him. There is a constant sense of the clock ticking down and the tension building throughout the book. I just love these characters and the style that the book is written in, with the constant interjection of Yuki's thoughts. This is such a fun story to read because Yuki is so amazingly quirky and has such a unique voice. The relationships between the friends is so touching, and I love the mixture of supernatural elements in the book- the spirits, the werewolves, and Yuki's powers. As soon as I finish a book I immediately want the next one!My blog- Always Lost in Stories2011-reads arc-or-for-review ghosts-spirits ...more1 likeLike CommentJessica (a GREAT read)1,792 reviews105 followersFollowFollowMay 4, 2011I received this e-book from the author for reviewE.J. Stevens' Spirit Storm was a good followup to She Smells the Dead. Samhain is drawing closer and Yuki is getting a little nervous, Samhain is when the dead walk the earth meaning more spirits will be visiting her. She wants to find a way to protect herself from the onslaught of spirits, but that's going to involve research.That's not all though! There's also a werewolf killer on the loose and Yuki is worried for Cal since he is a werewolf, and a little worried for Simon as well. Quite a bit goes on despite the book being pretty short. The ghost of one of the dead werewolves haunts Yuki, with his smell--burnt brownies this time. And she wants to help him move on. But things go terribly wrong during the investigation. Which is all I will say for spoiler purposes.Basically Yuki has a lot on her plate this time around and she has her friends at her side still to help out. What I liked most was Emma and Simon's bickering! I'm kinda seeing something brewing between those two. There's an age difference, but I can't recall if it was ever mentioned in exact years. But I like how they are always fighting! It's pretty comical.The pacing was pretty decent again, rather fast paced as things moved along. One problem after another until the ending comes. It has a somewhat resolved ending, but there's definitely room for more!Overall rating 4/5 stars1 likeLike CommentJessica Rodriguez 23 reviews25 followersFollowFollowAugust 18, 2011I have to say I'm really enjoying this series. In book two Yuki is still this super adorable goth girl except now she has become more in tune with her abilities to smell the dead. With Samhain fastly approaching she is going to have to find a way to protect herself. Calvin and Yuki are still together in this one and are adjusting well together. Calvin is now the Alpha of his pack and trying hard to make some great changes within the pack. I loved his way of taking charge of the pack he seemed most of the time calm and collective but with great force when making decisions. On top of Samhain there is a werewolf murderer on the loose. Also I really think I'm starting to like Emma even more than Yuki she is amazing. Not only is she a vet in training but she is a awesome friend to Yuki she has her back the whole time during this book. I also am loving Simon and Emma's little spats back in forth their bickering is so cute. I am totally in love with E.J.'s writing because she is a poet her stories just glide right together. I love how good this story makes me feel reading it. This book was a very quick read for me read it in about three days which hardly ever happens with running kids to look after. Over all I can't get enough of the Spirit Guide series now I'm off to finish the third installment Legend of Witchtrot Road.1 likeLike CommentAmber I.335 reviews69 followersFollowFollowJuly 4, 2011Spirit Storm picks up right where She Smells the Dead left off. Yuki is trying hard to figure out a way to save herself on Samhain when the spirits will be flooding in. While trying to figure out how to deal with that, Cal finds out there is a killer wolf on the loose and its killing other wolfs. The book is fast paced and there really is never a dull moment. Cal is really filling in his alpha roll and I can not wait to see how much he grows into that. Already he is amazing. Simon and Emma where a lot of fun in this book. Like I said before I could totally see them together. And I think in this book they are growing closer. Simon really came up in this book and I loved getting to see more of him. I was a little disappointed in the actual Samhain event. We had prepared for this for 2 books and I found it was wrapped up in a few pages and nothing crazy or major happened. It just was another day in the life of Yuki. I was expecting something a lot bigger after all the build up.I really couldn't put the book down. All the characters brought so much to this book and I enjoyed them all so much! I can not wait to see what happens next! 1 likeLike CommentStacy1,335 reviews62 followersFollowFollowMay 10, 2011reviewed by http://urbanfantasyinvestigations.blo...The SPIRIT STORM picks right up after SHE SMELLS THE DEAD ends. I'm so glad I got both books at the same time so I didn't have to wait to read what happened after all the lead up to the event. There is lots of mystery, suspense and action. Yuki has a lot on her plate, she has to worry about Samhain, help her injured boyfriend, look for clues to who is murdering members of Calvin's pack. Yuki is a strong character with a great group of friends behind her. The relationship between Calvin and Yuki continues to grow stronger. My only complaint was the actual Samhain event. After all the drama of book 1 and the preparation it just wasn't that big of a deal at the end, I can see how all the preparation made it that way but it just kinda left me feeling "That's it?". Having said that the other events in the book definitely made up for that everything is wrapped up nicely and I cant wait to see what Stevens brings us next.from-publisher-author1 likeLike CommentDenise7,194 reviews129 followersFollowFollowNovember 1, 2015The perfect book to read on Halloween for a bit of ghostly action with a lot of fun thrown in! With Samhain and the thinning of the veil between worlds coming rapidly closer, Yuki's ghost-smelling talent and the fact that she seems to attract the souls of the dead is putting her under more and more of a strain. Meanwhile, a member of Cal's wolfpack turns up brutally killed and another goes missing. Catching a killer and finding some form of spiritual protection strong enough to get Yuki through Halloween with her sanity intact make for a busy week for everyone involved and great entertainment for those following the exploits of Yuki & co.
