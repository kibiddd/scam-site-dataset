Caldecott Tunnel
The Caldecott Tunnel is a four-bore highway tunnel through the Berkeley Hills between Oakland, California and Orinda, California. The east-west tunnel is signed as a part of State Route 24 and connects Oakland to central Contra Costa County and is named after Thomas E. Caldecott (1878–1951), mayor of Berkeley from 1930–1932, member of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors 1933-1945, and president of Joint Highway District 13, which built the first two bores.
Bore 1 (the southernmost bore) and Bore 2 were completed in 1937 and are 3,610 feet (1,100 m) in length. Both carry two lanes each of eastbound traffic. Bore 3, completed in 1964, is 3,771 feet (1,149 m) in length. Bore 4 (the northernmost bore), completed in 2013, is 3,389 feet (1,033 m) in length. Bores 3 and 4 carry  two lanes each of westbound traffic.  All four bores cross the Hayward Fault Zone.
History
In the 19th century, traffic over the Berkeley Hills in this area went up Harwood Canyon, now known as Claremont Canyon (behind the Claremont Hotel). The road leading up the canyon from the west was initially called Harwood's Road, later changed to Telegraph Road, and finally, Claremont. The road on the other side of the hills was, and remains, Fish Ranch Road. An inn and stage coach stop called the Summit House once existed at the summit.

They're closing down the caldecott tunnel,so tonight I'll dream she's the bridge.I never knew there'd be distance between us,what I've done cannot be repeated...And I've got scars I'm willing to show you,you had heart that I'll never see,she had answers to all the wrong questions,It's funny these answers are all that I need.Carry me, carry me softly,let her down easy so she doesn't know.Carry me, carry me waiting,Let her down easy so she can let go.Tore down your freeway,built her an airplane,It's crazy the things we made in the sky.So picture me drowning,pretending I'm happy,we end up regreting the things..We don't try.Carry me, carry me softly,let her down easy so she doesn't know.Carry me, carry me waiting,Let her down easy so she can let go.Here with my problemsI don't need the light,they're bigger than darkness and darker than night.I leave on a promise of something that shines,perfection aint perfecta leaver will find. I find this all the timeCarry me, carry me softly,let her down easy so she doesn't know.Carry me, carry me waiting,
