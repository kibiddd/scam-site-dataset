Missed the drinking window on this bottle. Not too much to enjoy at this point. There is a wall of hard, chalky, grainy tannins that obscures the non descript dark red fruit. Finished with spice and alcohol. I have one more left, not sure if I should dump it or hold onto it as a science experiment.
