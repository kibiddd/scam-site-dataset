CALLING OF AN ANGEL, Nature's Cure for Cancer by Dr. Gary Glum
CALLING OF AN ANGEL
The
true story of Rene Caisse and an Indian herbal medicine called  Essiac, nature's
cure for cancer -- by Dr. Gary   Glum
[Newspaper clipping of Dr. Glum (right) in
Bracebridge, Ontario, Aug 9, 1989, Herald Gazette]
"Every year medical science spends
billions of dollars in a desperate search for the cure--or
cures--for cancer.  And yet, despite the use of increasingly expensive
and dangerous technology and drugs, we never seem to get any closer to sparing
mankind from our most dreaded and deadly disease.
"Is it possible that the answer to our
prayers about treating cancer has been available to us all along, a gift from
nature, hidden in the life-giving properties of certain plants that grow wild
all over North America?
"The answer is yes.  For more than
50 years, Rene Caisse, a nurse in Canada, successfully treated thousands of
cancer patients with a simple herbal formula that was discovered and first used
long ago by the Indians.
"Rene Caisse brewed the herbs into a
tea that she called Essiac, and many of her patients and their families and
friends swore that Essiac's healing--and pain-relief--powers were nothing short
of miraculous.  Distinguished physicians--from the 1930s until the
1980s--have spoken out in favor of Essiac's value as a cancer treatment.
"Yet Rene Caisse's use of a natural
treatment for cancer made her a controversial figure in Canada.  In the
midst of a national political debate, fueled by newspaper headlines, the
Canadian parliament in 1939 came with three votes of legalizing her use of
Essiac.
"For years after that narrow defeat,
under the constant threat of arrest and jail, Rene Caisse continued to treat
patients and win their passionate support.  She never charged a fee for her
service.  She accepted only voluntary contributions.  Her goal was to
help people, not make money, and the cancer patients fortunate enough to come
under her care came to think of her as an angel.
"But she was really a person of
greatness, a devoted healer, who wanted to make Essiac available to all of
mankind.  As a result of her fears about what the medical and legal
establishments would do with her formula for Essiac, she never released it
publicly.
"This book tells the incredible story
of Rene Caisse and her lifetime battle to bring forth Essiac, and reveals for
the first time publicly how to acquire the formula to brew Essiac in your own
home."  [Text taken from dust jacket]
