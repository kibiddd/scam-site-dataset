Reflections on Knowledge Management
Critical
Success Factors
The main challenge in sustaining a high-performance knowledge management program is to nurture
a knowledge-sharing culture that produces bottom-line results. See what it takes to succeed.
Drug Industry Workshops
The New Thinking workshop series sought to create a knowledge network aimed at developing breakthrough ideas that enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to achieve the next level of performance – and accelerate the transformation of the drug industry.
Glossary
What is knowledge management? How about knowledge, information and data?
Knowledge
Connections
Knowledge management is about connections. Who you know is as important as what you know. Learn how to build
the robust connections important for knowledge management.
Measuring Progress in Knowledge Management Programs
Measurement is a means for demonstrating the progress of your knowledge management program. It
is essential for continued organizational support, for understanding what is working, and for determining what needs to be changed to ensure the expected benefits are realized.
Knowledge
Management in Legal Departments
KM is being pursued in in-house legal departments and in law firms. Typical goals include: increasing efficiency, providing consistent service, working effectively as a global team, accelerating professional training & development, and improving recruiting, morale and employee retention.
Power = KnowledgeShared
According to the old adage, one plus one equals three. See how the power of an organization is exponentially related to its shared knowledge.
Reading List
Useful books for the new or seasoned knowledge manager.
