It is one of the few places in the world to reproduce so faithfully the complexity of the natural environment and the interactions between animal and plant species. Summer and winter alike, the Biodôme is the perfect family outing!Read moreDuration: 1-2 hoursMeets animal welfare guidelinesSuggest edits to improve what we show.Improve this listingTours & experiencesExplore different ways to experience this place.See options3,260What is Travellers’ Choice?Tripadvisor gives a Travellers’ Choice award to accommodations, attractions and restaurants that consistently earn great reviews from travellers and are ranked within the top 10% of properties on Tripadvisor.Revenue impacts the experiences featured on this page, learn more.Top ways to experience Biodôme De Montreal and nearby attractionsLIKELY TO SELL OUT*Montreal 6hr Private Walking Tour with Certified GuideRail Toursfrom £295.06 per adult (price varies by group size)LIKELY TO SELL OUT*APP Self-Guided Tours Montreal with AudioguideLikely To Sell Outfrom £6.82 per group (up to 5)LIKELY TO SELL OUT*Montreal 4hr Private Walking Tour with Certified GuideRail Toursfrom £193.49 per adult (price varies by group size)Montreal Olympic Park Self-Guided Walking Tour and Scavenger HuntPrivate Sightseeing Toursfrom £31.74 per group (up to 6)Museum of Illusions Montreal - 70+ Illusions to Explore3.83.8 of 5 bubbles(33)Museumsfrom £16.56 per adultThe MTL Detours Montreal Underground City + Downtown Tour 4.94.9 of 5 bubbles(72)Recommended95% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Underground Tours from £26.91 per adultQuebec city & Montmorency Falls 1 Day Tour from Montreal4.84.8 of 5 bubbles(760)Recommended95% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Day Tripsfrom £35.41 per adultAwesome Curling Experience 4.84.8 of 5 bubbles(89)Recommended94% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Sports Lessons from £60.72 per adult2024Explore Old Montreal Small Group Walking Tour 4.94.9 of 5 bubbles(793)Recommended98% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Cultural Toursfrom £32.57 per adultLIKELY TO SELL OUT*Bike Tour : Downtown, Old Montreal, Waterfront by Fitz Montreal4.94.9 of 5 bubbles(181)Recommended98% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Private and Luxuryfrom £56.82 per adultMontreal Walking Food Tour With Secret Food Tours4.94.9 of 5 bubbles(1,268)Recommended97% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Culinary Toursfrom £61.35 per adult (price varies by group size)The Original Old Montréal Walking Tour 4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(756)Recommended94% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Historical Toursfrom £18.22 per adultFat eBike Ride on Mount Royal4.94.9 of 5 bubbles(48)Recommended97% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.E-Bike Toursfrom £48.82 per adultSPECIAL OFFERThe Original Montreal Mural Arts Tour by Spade & Palacio5.05 of 5 bubbles(335)Recommended99% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Cultural Toursfrom £22.08 £17.67 per adultLIKELY TO SELL OUT*Montréal Downtown and Underground City Private Walking Tour4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(19)Recommended94% of reviewers gave this product a bubble rating of 4 or higher.Likely To Sell Outfrom £118.69 per group (up to 15)Are you currently on your trip?Help us find experiences available for you.YesNoThe area Address4777 Pierre de-Coubertin Ave, Montreal, Quebec H1V 1B3 CanadaNeighbourhood: Olympic Park & Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (HoMa)Named for the Olympic Stadium complexes built for the 1976 games, the Olympic Park and the surrounding neighbourhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (HoMa) make up an invigorated area dedicated to "Space for Life." Around the Olympic Village's arenas and stadiums, Rue Sherbrooke welcomes exploration of its sculpture gardens decorated in the works of Jean-Paul Riopelle and its museum culture headed by the historical Château Dufresne. Maisonneuve Park offers interactive experiences at its bio-dome, insectarium, planetarium, and botanical gardens. For a change of scene, the gentrified space along Rue Ontario Est is packed with the city's newest, edgiest cafes, where an imaginative, youthful crowd sips foamy cappuccinos. A visit here is incomplete without stepping into the vast halls of the Maisonneuve Market, with flower stalls, wine depots, and local produce.Read moreHow to get thereViau • 4 min walkPie-IX • 9 min walkReach out directlyVisit websiteCallEmailFull viewBest nearbyWe rank these restaurants and attractions by balancing reviews from our members with how close they are to this location.Restaurants1,456 within 3 milesBagatelle Bistro4.54.5 of 5 bubbles(182)0.7 mi££ - £££ • French • Gastropub • Vegetarian friendlyEspace Vego5.05 of 5 bubbles(1)200 ftCafeEtat Major4.44.4 of 5 bubbles(268)0.8 mi££ - £££ • French • Vegetarian friendlyBotanical Garden Restaurant3.83.8 of 5 bubbles(131)0.4 mi££ - £££ • Grill • Contemporary • Vegetarian friendlyHochelaga Pizza Restaurant4.04 of 5 bubbles(21)0.3 mi£ • Pizza • CanadianPoutine Centrale4.14.1 of 5 bubbles(127)0.6 mi£ • Quick Bites • Fast food • CanadianHélicoptère4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(58)0.7 mi££ - £££ • International • Canadian • Vegetarian friendlyResto Bar Le Toit Rouge3.33.3 of 5 bubbles(76)0.4 mi££ - £££ • Italian • BarHoche Glace4.64.6 of 5 bubbles(17)0.5 mi£ • Dessert • Italian • CanadianLa Belle Province3.63.6 of 5 bubbles(24)0.5 mi£ • Fast food • CanadianSee allAttractions660 within 6 milesPlanétarium De Montréal3.83.8 of 5 bubbles(581)411 ftObservatories & PlanetariumsLa Tour de Montreal3.83.8 of 5 bubbles(509)0.1 miObservation Decks & TowersOlympic Park (Parc olympique)3.93.9 of 5 bubbles(1,417)0.3 miPoints of Interest & Landmarks • Architectural BuildingsCentre Pierre Charbonneau5.05 of 5 bubbles(1)0.2 miArenas & StadiumsJapanese Garden4.64.6 of 5 bubbles(377)0.5 miGardensSaputo Stadium4.34.3 of 5 bubbles(98)0.3 miArenas & StadiumsMontréal Insectarium4.14.1 of 5 bubbles(767)0.4 miSpeciality Museums • Science MuseumsMontreal Botanical Garden4.54.5 of 5 bubbles(7,657)0.7 miGardensNotre-Dame Basilica4.74.7 of 5 bubbles(20,453)Points of Interest & Landmarks • Churches & CathedralsChateau Dufresne (Dufresne House)4.44.4 of 5 bubbles(80)0.5 miHistoric Sites • Art MuseumsSee allContributeWrite a reviewUpload a photoReviewsQ&AFiltersEnglishMost RecentMost Recent: Reviews ordered by most recent publish date in descending order.

Travel from the sub-arctic to the tropical rainforests in  just a few steps. Penguins, birds, fish, and animals of all sizes and stripes. Don't worry - there is food for the weary. Canada, and especially Montreal, should be proud of this world-class attraction.Read moreWritten 20 March 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Enjoyed seeing many species of boreal, tropical and arctic animals and birds. Highlight was the river otter and penguins. Suggest you go to planetarium and watch a film then hit the biodome then go back to planetarium and watch another film. English films are not as frequent as French. $23 for each location.Read moreWritten 13 March 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Tour was interrupted by a text that my card was being used--thieves smashed car windows and stole multiple items in the car. American cars are targeted as are stunts. Beware.

The biodome is small, but it was a nice experience if you're in the area. The space is divided into regions of habitats you would find in the Americas. Our older child enjoyed walking up to the higher level views that were offered in the "Maple Forest" and "Tropical" regions. There were few animals in each area, but they appeared well cared for. The polar region had ice walls for its entrance, which enhanced the feeling of entering the penguin habitat, and the Gulf Laurent region allowed for an underwater view. Overall, it was an hour or so outing. We had a stroller, and all areas, for the most part, were accessible.

From the lush Tropical Rainforest to the cold, snowy Laurentian Forest, it offers an immersive look at diverse wildlife and plants. The exhibits are well-curated, providing both educational and awe-inspiring moments for all ages. Whether you're exploring the vibrant species of the rainforest or the icy world of the polar region, the Biodome is a must-see for anyone visiting Montreal.Read moreWritten 30 December 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The facilities are well built to maintain the captive species in an environment as safe as possible while allowing the visitors to engage in an immersive experience without putting the animals and plants at risk. They make sure no one feeds the animals (as much as they can...there's always this one person). Plus, as a Latin-American myself, I felt very happy to see such beautiful representation of the flora and fauna from my native country and the neighbors.Read moreWritten 29 November 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It features a polar habitat with ice covered walls and penguins and puffins and there’s a rainforest with massive trees, a waterfall, parrots, exotic frogs, monkeys, a bat cave, a cayman and other fascinating animals. I really enjoyed it and so did my goddaughter. I think a great addition would be perhaps a butterfly farm and I think the cafe could be improved with more options and milk for the tea but overall a great day out!Read moreWritten 23 October 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Worth the Trip!Oct 2024 • CouplesI highly recommend visiting the Biodôme in Montreal. It is such a unique experience: there are distinct habitats with flora and fauna and the animals live inside those habitats at the Biodome. Imagine macaws in large trees in a jungle like setting, penguins inside a polar area, etc. It was very well done and allowed for up close viewing of the animals. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a short car ride fromold Montreal. We Ubered and the price to and from was extremely reasonable. I recommend buying tickets in advance.Read moreWritten 20 October 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
