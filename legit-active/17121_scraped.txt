When a crew member needed emergency dental work, he had to go to a nearby town as the answering machine of Castel del Monte's dentist declared that he was "unavailable, due to his appearance in a Hollywood film."GoofsJack/Edward cites the muzzle velocity of the rifle as 360 miles per hour (mph). No expert cites muzzle velocity in mph. It's always in feet per second (fps) or meters per second (mps). Beyond that, 360 mph is only 528 fps. That's hardly a reasonable muzzle velocity for that rifle, and it would likely be very inaccurate.QuotesFather Benedetto: [speaking to Jack] You cannot deny the existence of hell. You live in it. It is a place without love.Crazy creditsThe credits at the end are in order of appearance. However, the 3 hookers are listed in the order: Hooker #2, Hooker #3 and Hooker #1, which logically doesn't make sense.ConnectionsFeatured in Maltin on Movies: The American (2010)SoundtracksLa BambolaWritten by Ruggero Cini, Franco Migliacci (as Francesco Migliacci) and Bruno ZambriniPerformed by Patty PravoCourtesy of Sony Music Entertainment (Italy) s.p.a.by arrangement with Sony Music LicensingUser reviews601ReviewFeatured review7/10More character study than thrillerThis is not the massive action thrill ride you might expect. Instead, it is a slow, character-driven look at an aging assassin. Clooney is good, but it is questionable to have him play a stone-faced killer when the actor is at his best when he utilizes his compelling charm. The best part of the movie is the beautiful cinematography, which highlights the stunning Italian countryside. It adds to the whole Euro indie fell that the film has. The American is pretty slow at times, but the shift in tone is somewhat refreshing.cardsrockJun 17, 2019PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ21How long is The American?Powered by AlexaWhich of the tatoos are Jack's, and which are Clooney's, if any?Why was Mathilde shot by Pavel?DetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 1, 2010 (Canada)Countries of originUnited StatesUnited KingdomOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookTVP VODLanguagesEnglishItalianAlso known asL'américainFilming locationsCastel del Monte, L'Aquila, Abruzzo, ItalyProduction companiesFocus FeaturesGreenlit RightsSmokehouse PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$20,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$35,606,376Opening weekend US & Canada$13,177,790Sep 5, 2010Gross worldwide$67,876,281See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 45 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDTSAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page
