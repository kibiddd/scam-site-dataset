What is FamousWhy?
Continuously adapted to our visitors interests the site covers a large range of "famous" related topics, written by contributors and quality assured by our moderators. It also provides with the possibility to join the community and make new friends, share opinions and enjoy a virtual world of technology and popularity.
The key idea behind this website is to encourage visitors to contribute, explaining and highlighting the "fame" reasons of people and things.
All this is monitored by moderators, so that we can all contribute and give arguments for or against certain issues, with respect, dignity and non descrimination, keeping in mind that all people have a right to an opinion.
