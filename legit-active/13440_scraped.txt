While his days of headbanging and greasy mustaches may be behind him, actor and musician Paul Spence has found a new way to give’r with his band, the Montreal-based CPC Gangbangs.“We’re headed down the East Coast, through America’s crotch, up the West Coast, and across the Canadian zipper,” explains Spence’s bandmate, guitarist Roy “Choyce” Vucino, reached in New York as the four-piece starts on a 28-date tour in support of its debut disc, 2007’s Mutilation Nation. As you’d expect from someone who describes North American geography in such colourful terms, Vucino is eager to share the road adventures thus far. “Our stereo got ripped off, so we’ve been reading Thinner by Stephen King,” he explains. “It’s about a Gypsy cursing an old man to constantly lose weight, so it’s pretty riveting. We switch up on the narration, though, just to keep it interesting.”It’s perfectly delivered comments like these that illustrate the chaotic rockers’ commitment to theatrical absurdity. Even the origin of the band’s puzzling name—an urban-legend-type tale in which a friend murdered someone while high on PCP and was hauled away by the cops screaming “CPC! CPC!”—feels like it was lifted from a documentary by Farrel Mitchner.Reputed to be a disorienting spectacle that puts the piss-in-the-mouth antics of the Black Lips to shame, CPC Gangbangs’ live show promises the dizzying intoxication and boneheaded mayhem of Fubar’s most classic moments. Think the “Fuck that chair up!” scene set to a sonic barrage of duelling guitars and unadulterated ’70s scuzz.“We don’t plan anything—some shows are crazy, some aren’t,” Vucino explains. “We’ve been known to do the occasional fire trick, but usually people just dig the music and aren’t there to see us hurt ourselves, although it does seem to happen.”While fans are attracted by CPC Gangbangs’ wildly energetic mix of raging Stooges-calibrated punk, the opportunity to see “the Deaner” in action is also pretty compelling. Laughing at the legions of metalheads who come to shows to pay homage, Vucino says, “It’s hard to get tired of people buying you beers, but sometimes I get annoyed with stained shirts from shot-gunning beers when I’m already wasted.”CPC Gangbangs plays the Astoria next Friday (May 30).
