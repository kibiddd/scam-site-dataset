Yakima County Washington Genealogy
Welcome to
Yakima County, Washington
Genealogy
Yakima County is located in South Central Washington, on the
East side of the Cascade Mountains. The Biles-Longmire wagon
train came through Yakima Valley and made its way over
Naches Pass in 1853, the first wagon train to cross the
Cascades north of the Columbia River.
It was another eight years before permanent settlement began
in the Yakima Valley.
The F. Mortimer Thorp family is credited as being first.
Thorp drove his cattle herd up from
Klickitat Co in October of 1860 and moved his family in
February of 1861.
Yakima County was formed from
Walla Walla Co.
in 1865, and originally included all of
Kittitas
Co. and part of
Benton Co.
The region, with its sunny weather and abundant irrigation
water, became a major orchard and farming area.
