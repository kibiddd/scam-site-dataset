Victor Flores was elected to serve District 7 on the BART Board of Directors in November 2024. Victor currently works as a resilience manager at Greenbelt Alliance, where he advocates for climate resilience policies, preserving open space, and building more housing near transit and jobs. He’s also worked for two Oakland City Council members. Victor is a firm believer in the power of good government and public service and well-versed about the intersection of urban planning, environmentalism, zoning, and inequity that could be changed through policy decisions.Victor grew up in Oakland’s Fruitvale District, the son of Mexican immigrants. At age 17, he found himself hopeless after receiving an 8-year prison sentence. Despite remarkable odds, he overcame adversity, first by becoming a liaison between the prisoners and corrections officers while incarcerated and later by completing community college and earning a bachelors degree from UC Berkeley in Chicanx Latinx Studies. While at Berkeley, Victor continued to work while joining with first-generation organizations to support others and outreach to high school students.District 7 is in Alameda and San Francisco Counties and includes the Northern portion of Oakland including the communities of West Oakland, the City of Piedmont, the City of Emeryville, the City of Alameda, the Bayview District of San Francisco, and Treasure Island.District 7 BART stations include: 12th St/Oakland City Center, 19th St/Oakland, Ashby (shared with District 3), Lake Merritt, MacArthur, Rockridge, and West Oakland
