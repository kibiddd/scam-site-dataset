I was with Mom and Dad this week. For another sad occasion another loved one sent up to you to keep you company. It’s so ironic that this email came today. I’ve been thinking of you all week and wanted to shout out to you. You are very much missed and loved. Keep watching over everyone. Love youJanuary 27, 2017I just wanted to share this because its been on my mind. Maybe give family some comfort. I had a dream one night. I was in a room with other people. I was sitting on the floor when the door opened and this boy came in. He was dancing and smiling ear to ear. What was weird about this dream is I saw color. He was wearing all red with a hat on. He dance right over to me and smiled thats when I woke up and for a couple of minutes I laid in my bed. I recognized his face. It took me a bit then realized it was Anthony. I only knew of him because I grew up in folcroft but was never really friends with him we hung out a couple times. So when I came on here I wasn't sure about writing this until I saw his picture. He is in red!!! Its been a long time since his passing. There had to be a reason he came to me in a dream and I believe it was to let his family know he is ok and happy. I hope you find comfort in this.November 14, 2013Hey nant...been thinking about you a lot lately.  I was at crossfit last night and ONCE AGAIN..the timer clock was stuck at 511...this is not the first time....please continue to be my angel...I hate that im here and your there.

Holla Back, Love, MommyOctober 14, 2009Hi Ant, Just wanted to check in with you. We are all doing fine. I am just a little slow these days , can't seem to move forward.  I feel like I have cement shoes on and I am stuck in the same place.I need a little push from you and to know that you are ok.After 5 years and almost 5 months its still hard. I use up all the energy I have to go on and there are times like now that I am physically drained from pushing myself.  I know I need to keep on pushing and can't afford to stop.I don't think you are resting in peace either because I am not letting go. I want you to RIP but letting go is so hard and I am not ready.  I don't know if I will ever be ready for that. Thanks for the sign on Sat even though it freaked everyone out but that is you. You always have to make your grand entrance and you sure did that night.  It meant a lot to me so show up whenever you can it makes me know you are around. Mom-Mom is trying to tell me something and I don't know what. Tell her to come out with it.Well love and miss you more and more everyday.  They say it gets easier but I don't think so. Continue to watch over us especially our babies, your niece and nephews.Holla Back!Love Mommymarie ditullioOctober 2, 2009Love and Miss you Ant.  I am just having a couple of bad days.

Did you hear GiGi and me singing to you? It was so cute Ant. We were sitting on the plane on Friday and turns to me and says, Aunt Craw when we are in the sky, will we see Uncle Anthony. I looked at those big brown eyes (trying not to cry) and said, lets look out at the window and see if we can find him. He should be wearing Angel wings. She said, I cant see him. I said, he is there. As soon as we got to Mikey's apartment, she ran up to him and said daddy we looked for Uncle Anthony in the sky but we could not find him but Aunt Craw said he was there. Then we all hugged. Thanks for making sure we had a good flight. I was nervous. Well Ant, hope your living it up up there. I love you and miss you and I still have sadness in my heart.

It seems to get harder.Love you,Holla BackMommymommy ditullioAugust 15, 2007Hi Son,you should see your lil nephew.  He is so beautiful. He has these cute little lips that you just want to bite.  he is so small but I guess he came by it honestly. Your sister was a 5 pound baby. I wish you were here to join in this happy occassion but I have to live with knowing your are up above watching us below.  Gi is so good with him too. Not an ounce of jealousy does she show. She is getting big fast. You should hear her talk she holds a conversation better than some adults. She knows who you are by your pics. She sometimes takes them off the table and says"thats my uncle" my daddys brother. He is an angel in heaven". Of course I will never let your memory die. You live on forever in our hearts and souls.Well until next time, I hope you know I love and miss you and think of you everyday.  It doesn't get easier.  thats a joke. I still carry the void and pain in my heart as if it was 3 years ago.Love you and holla back,MommyPS hope you met up with Grandpop. Be easy on him. He suffered a lot the last 7 weeks of his life.CHRISTINA RINDONEAugust 10, 2007Hey Ant,I had the baby on July 26th at 8:01 PM. He was 5 lbs 12 ounces. well, it was actually 12.7 ounces and as per all my teachers you are supposed to round up. so i consider him 5 lbs 13 ounces. and the weird thing is, 513. reverse the #'s. 531. its the day you died. but its also a sign that you were with me while i was giving birth. it wasnt that bad. i went for my weekly test and the doc was like you arent leaving we are inducing today. jason raced to the hospital, daddy raced up from the shore and picked up mommy and came over. i wasnt in labor that long. they broke my water at 11 and he was born 8:01 pm. so, congrats to you on becoming an uncle for the 2nd time. and this is your first nephew. you gotta see him. he is fair skined, light hair and blue eyes. just like his mommy. we were gonna give him your name as a middle name but he does not look like a Anthony. not at all. so we named him Romeo Jason. So we can call him Romeo or RJ. i call him peanut b/c he is a little peanut. he is so beautiful. Everynight jason and i pray to you before we go to sleep. do you hear us?? we hope you do.well, im a little tired and i am gonna go lay down. i miss you so much. i hope you are doing well up there. all is well here. we will be seeing mikey soon. i cant wait. one more thing. romeo smiles when he sleeps. mommy said that means he sees angels in his dreams. i like to think that he sees you and our crazy mom-mom. continue to come to him. i cant wait to tell him all about his uncle anthony. i love you. love,your sisterRita DAmbrosioAugust 9, 2007Hi AnthonySorry i havent writin sooner but you are always on my mind.

I wish you were here to see our little man grow up. I dont mind you coming to me in my dreams but do you at least think you can talk to me instead of smiling?

I will always love and miss you.Love your sis,ChrissyOh, i know you know i have been living in SP for the past year. I can only imagine if you were still here.

Love you!Marie DitullioApril 18, 2007Hi Ant:Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. 24 today.  I remember that day like it was yesterday.  You were like a little man. Black curly hair and a beautiful smile, with the most gorgeous eyes.I wrote to you last night but it didn't post so I guess maybe you did not approve of what I wrote.  Yes, I am angry and bitter but what do you expect. The VA massacres don't help because it has brought me back to May 31,2004 all over again. The knock at the door by the cops handing your brother a note, daddy coming down the basement to get me, calling No Wildwood Police Dept to hear the detective tell me, "I am sorry to tell you Mrs. Ditullio but your son,Anthony, was found dead this morning".  So I think about all those parents that lost their child at VA Tec and I know what they are going thru. I wonder how they got the news about their child.  They have a long road ahead of them and my heart goes out to them (what I have left of a heart)I guess thats where God comes in and faith.Well let me go because I can go on and on.  I just wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday and tell you I miss you and still hurt and always will.Holla Back,Love,MommyAunt Re D,AmbrosioApril 18, 2007Hi AnthonyDid not want this day to end with out wishing you a Happy Birthday.You are always in our thoughts.love you lots.

That seems to be the new trend these days. Well just had the need to get in touch with you today.  You see some days are good and then there are those days that are not so good.

Dent Go ahead and mention my child the one that died you knowDon't worry about hurting me further the depth of may pain doesn't showDon't worry about making me cryI'm always crying inside. Help me heal by releasing the tears that I try to hide.I'hurt when you keep silent pretending it doesn't exist. I'd rather you mention my child knowing that he has been missed.You asked me how I'm doing I say pretty good or fine but healing is something on-going I feel it will take a lifetime.Some words from your friends....We can't stop the rain. But we can hold an umbrellaDonnaJune 3, 2006Smoke,I purposely didn't write on your 2 year anniversary because  I didn't think we needed to talk about your death but only about your new life where there is no pain, no depression, no sickness or tragedy.  Your new life no matter how painful it is for us is filled with joy and happiness and eternal sunshine, and days at the beach, and hotdogs and football games.  All the good things that you wanted and needed.  Yes it is sad that we cannot all share those things with you here, but I know that you are thinking of us and we will always be thinking of you.  I am in work today and it is an ugly day.  Please bring some sunshine for Craw tonight and on her wedding day.Dude and I love you a lot.Aunt Re DambrosioMay 31, 2006DEAR ANTHONY I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO WRITA YOU ON THE OTHER SITE AND IT WOULD NOT GO THROUGH.WE WENT TO VIST YOU TODAY UNC CARMIE AND ME.

We did the finishing touches on Monday so its just a matter of getting it put in. I put a little phrase in that I hope both you and mom-mom will like. Sorry it took so long but you know its not like I was shopping around for a pair of new shoes. Somehow some people just don't understand.  We were picking out a tombstone for our dead son's grave.I hope it doesn't go up whileI am away in China. I would like to be here when it goes up because it will be emotional for everyone.  It was not an easy job but lately nothing in life is easy any more.  Everything is a struggle. But I am sure we will survive.  This weekend is Memorial Day weekend.  I know its not your death date (5-31) but this holiday weekend holds as much signifcance as May 31st does to me. I would like to stay in bed the whole weekend but I know I can't nor should.  I would only be giving in to life and I don't want to do that. There are too many that depend on me so I can't let them down.  Its hard being torn between 2 worlds.  Yours and ours.  You need to be where I am to undertand that.  I know I haven't written to you in a while.  But its hard to write to you.  I should be talking to in person not writing to you.  I hope you hear my prayers every morning noon and night.  We have a lot going on in the next few weeks so I really need your strength and guidance.  Its those bitter sweet times.  You should be here to participate but your not so on June 17th your absence will truly be felt by everyone. But I know deep within my heart you will be with us in spirit and I know without a doubt you will make your presence know in some way shape or form. After all you always did.I love you Ant and miss you more and more.  Life sometimes sucks!Holla BackLove,MommyRobin O'DonnellMay 14, 2006Happy Belated Birthday Nant...

It's not that I didn't care about you because you know that is not the case.  Things are just crazy but thoughts of you are never far from me.  The house is coming along well, spring is just around the corner and the trees and flowers are blooming.  I hear a lot of noises in the house but I figure it's my "kids" chasing you around the house.  You are always welcome in our home.  Stay cool and I promise to write more than I have been.  Love you always, DRobin O'DonnellMarch 10, 2006I love you anthony and miss you so much.  I need you right now I am struggling.  Remain my guardian angel.

I am also writing to ask you to give Carol hugs and kisses from us.  Tell her we miss her and always will.  I hope you are with her and looking down on us.  Somethings are just not meant to be in life.  But I guess things happen for a reason. I hope someday I will find out.  What I can't understand is if you weren't meant to be here with us why were you given to me to begin with?  I know one of those "mommy's stupid questions".  I can't help how my mind works these days.  I guess you can say crazy.Well later and remember I love you and miss you and life is so different without you.Don't forget to Holla Back from wherever you are.Carol, please look after my little boy for me.
