Any deal was dead until around 1900 BST, when Arteta told Moyes he wished to leave."Moyes spoke to the chairman, Bill Kenwright, and said he did not want to keep a player who did not wish to play for Everton."Arteta was Everton's highest-paid player ever on around Â£75,000 a week and took a big pay cut to join Arsenal."Arteta joined Everton from Real Socieded for Â£2m in 2005 and has scored 35 goals in 208 appearances.He started his career with Barcelona before spells with Paris Saint-Germain FC and Rangers.The Spaniard suffered a knee ligament injury in February 2009 and was sidelined for almost 12 months before signing a new five-year deal in August 2010.Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown told BBC Sport that both Arteta and Benayoun were "solid signings".But when asked if they would be adequate replacements for the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri, Keown added: "No they're not, it's very hard to replace those players."I think back to the [Dennis] Bergkamp era, the impetus those players brought. Arteta is a great passer, Benayoun is not getting into Chelsea team. It's a mixed bag for Arsenal fans."Benayoun, the Israel captain, wrote on social networking site Twitter, external: "I sign with Arsenal, very happy and excited about it, but now my head is only in the game against grecce on Friday, thanks for the support." Both clubs later confirmed the move had gone through.Chelsea offered Liverpool Â£8m plus Benayoun for Reds midfielder Raul Meireles on Tuesday, but that deal was rejected.He joined Blues from Liverpool for Â£5m in July 2010 but was restricted to 10 appearances last season because of an Achilles injury and has seen only one minute of action this time round.It had been rumoured Benayoun would be included in an offer from Chelsea for Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric.Newcastle had also been linked with the Israeli.Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner completed a move away from Emirates Stadium just before the window closed, joining Sunderland on a season-long loan.More on this storyEverton sign pair on loan dealsPublished1 September 2011Arsenal defender Traore joins QPRPublished30 August 2011Around the BBCBBC London sportArsenal weatherRelated internet linksFootball on the BBCBBC Sport Premier LeagueArsenalEvertonChelseaThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesReal in talks over finalising Alexander-Arnold signingPublished8 hours agoLast-gasp Brooks goal earns Wales a point in North MacedoniaIsak stars as Sweden thrash Northern IrelandElsewhere on the BBCUncovering the dark side of football hooliganismRemembering loved ones lost to Covid-19Helena Bonham Carter shines a light on secret WW2 storiesCan you sort the fact from the fiction?Elsewhere in SportFour tactical lessons we learned from Tuchel's first gamesHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coachIn pictures: Sporting photos of the week'England show Tuchel's search for thrills will be no quick fix''All the players just went 'ooooh!' - and he completely blanked me' Video'All the players just went 'ooooh!' - and he completely blanked me'Is Lawson in danger of being dropped after two races?'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch'A return to Scotland's worst of times under Clarke''McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'Six-way photo finish in 60m hurdles as Charlton wins gold.
