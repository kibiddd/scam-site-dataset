Emeryville [1] is a small city on the San Francisco Bay that acts as a gateway to the East Bay from San Francisco.  It exists at the intersection of three major freeways:  I-80, I-580, and I-880.
Emeryville is going through a period of aggressive re-development started during the 1990s and 2000s, where industrial factories and warehouses are being replaced by modern retail and residential uses. Much of this was spurred by anti-development policies in neighbors such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The city is also known for its IKEA store and tech companies, such as Pixar studios. The city is featured on a map in the film "The Incredibles" with actual street names.
Get in[edit]
By air[edit]
Oakland International Airport (OAK) is the obvious choice, but SFO will also do. From the airports, see rail section on BART.
By train[edit]
BART is the regional heavy rail service which will connect you to San Francisco, Oakland, and other cities in the Bay Area. Sadly, there is no BART station in Emeryville, but simply get off BART at the MacArthur station in Oakland and take the free Emery-Go-Round [2] shuttle. Warning: MacArthur is not recommended at night due to high danger of violent crime.
Emeryville is home to the Bay Area's major Amtrak [3] station, which is located just east of the Public Market. Amtrak buses run from the Emeryville station across the Bay Bridge to San Francisco. Two long distance Amtrak routes run daily to and from Emeryville: The California Zephyr [4] route connects Emeryville to Chicago via Denver, Salt Lake City, and Reno. The Coast Starlight [5] route runs from Los Angeles to Portland (Oregon) and Seattle via Emeryville.
Amtrak also operates two short distance trains through Emeryville: The Capitol Corridor [6] runs 16 times daily (11 on weekends and holidays) between Sacramento and Oakland, with some trains running south to San Jose. The San Joaquins [7] runs 4 times daily between Bakersfield, Stockton and Oakland, with a stop in Emeryville.
By car[edit]
From San Francisco, take I-80 East and exit on Powell St.
From points East, take I-80 West and exit on Powell St.
The complex freeway intersections just to the south of Emeryville are referred to as the Maze for good reason.  Here are some tips to help your confusion:
Be aware that when traveling through Berkeley and Emeryville, I-80 west travels on the same road as I-580 east and vice versa.
When traveling from I-880 north onto I-80 east, you cannot exit at Powell. Instead merge right furiously and exit at Ashby/Shellmound. Take the Shellmound fork and right at Shellmound. Go straight and you'll see the Public Market and the rest of Emeryville shortly.
Get around[edit]
Driving is the best way to get around Emeryville.  However, expect traffic delays if you want to go anywhere near Ikea or the Bay St. Mall.
Shuttle service from BART is provided by the free Emery Go Round [8], and the local provider AC Transit. Transit trip planning is available online [9].
See[edit]
Emeryville is an interesting mix of old warehouses, manufacturing plants, and houses and new development in the form of shopping malls and live-work lofts. The Emeryville Marina has stunning views of San Francisco and the greater bay: take Powell Ave. west of I-80.
Do[edit]
The Oaks, San Pablo Ave at 40th St. is a card club for Texas Holdem players.

Large chain stores are found in abundance in Emeryville. Bay Street Emeryville is a large outdoor, "main street" style shopping center parallel to Shellmound past Christie that includes an AMC Movie Theater, Barnes & Noble, EQ3 Furniture, Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Banana Republic, and many sit-down restaurants including P.F.

Four Points by Sheraton, Christie and Powell. Great location, decent hotel. Has a "business center".

Stay safe[edit]
The large stores, the Public Market, and the Amtrak station are all safe areas.
Large streets except San Pablo Ave. south of Powell are also safe.  Treat Emeryville with the same safety attitudes you would treat a large city like San Francisco.
Get out[edit]
Berkeley - This neighboring city is famous for its liberal activism, and offers numerous interesting shops, restaurants, and nightlife spots for travelers.
