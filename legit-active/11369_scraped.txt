He patiently answered my questions and he was VERY patient. Although I left with some questions, it's my own fault. (I should have made a list.) Their staff is friendly and professional.  I felt like my needs were met to the best degree that Dr. Tallman could meet them. It's my own fault (and my condition's) that they weren't 100% met. The office is easy to find. I'll definitely be going back.The above is my perception today, but I have memory problems, thanks to my condition.
