Women’s World Cup 2011: Japan Stuns USA in Frankfurt, Germany:

Japan shocked the Americans on Sunday in an incredible Women’s World Cup Final, winning 3-1 on penalty kicks after coming from behind in a 2-2 tie.
This was the first attempt that Japan has had in a Women’s World Cup Final match.  Japan had failed the first 25 meetings between them and America, which shows just how shocking this victory really is.
“The players were patient, they wanted to win this game,” Sasaki said. “I think it’s because of that the Americans scored only two goals.”
The Americans after the match were simply stunned.They believed they were the ones meant to be World Cup champions after this year — needing a playoff to qualify, a loss in group play to Sweden, the epic comeback against Brazil, however they simply couldn’t pull off one last thriller. While Japan celebrated the victory, the American team just stood at midfield and watched in despair.
“There are really no words,” Abby Wambach said. “We were so close.”
The Americans scored first, with Alex Morgan in the 69th minute.  11 minutes later, Aya Miyama scored for Japan to make the score 1-1.  With a few great saves from Hope Solo and Ayumi Kaihori, the game went into extra time to the 120 minute ruling.  In the 104th minute, Abby Wambach nailed it through for a goal, putting the Americans up 2-1, and when the game seemed won, Japan retaliated.  At minute 117, Japan’s star Homare Sawa tied the game with only three minutes left, leading to penalty kicks.
In the penalty shootout, America just didn’t bring their game.  Between the four Americans that took shots, Abby Wambach was the only one to score, while Aya Miyama, Mizuho Sakaquchi, and Saki Kumaqai each made goals to clinch the victory and leave Germany victorious.
The victory has been tremendous to Japan, which has been devastated by storm related tragedies.  The storm-torn nation reveled in the win, bringing the country together and giving the nation something to cheer for.
“If any other country was to win this, then I’m really happy and proud for Japan,” Lloyd said. “Deep down inside I really thought it was our destiny to win it. But maybe it was Japan’s.”
