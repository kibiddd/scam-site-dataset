Ann says: February 22, 2011 at 7:10 am I donât understand why people are giving Tommy any grief. Heâs a great guy & people should keep their negative opinions to themselves. Just shut the heck up! Glambert3911 says: February 22, 2011 at 7:31 am Itâs unfortunate that a handful of immature/rude (so called fans) spoil it for the thousands of passionate sane fans. Sadly the negative is what stands out. Donât waste the pretty!!! Barb says: February 22, 2011 at 9:22 am I know only Tommy was named because of comments going directly to him on twitter. The rest of his comments were in reference to the rest of the BS being flung around. Nasty comments about Sauli or comments being flung from some fans toward each other depending on what side of the fence they stood, or toward Adam himself for the choices he made in his private life. These bold comments were needed, but sadly there will remain some that continue to cling to their reality. Hopeful that for some really take a long hard look why they are part of this fanbase in the first place, and how their actions effect others in the real world. Never followed an artist like this before, so this has all been a real eye-opener. juliette says: February 22, 2011 at 10:06 am Tommy is so sweet.  My only wish is that Tommy and Adam would be an item.  They are soul mates.  They make a perfect couple. Tommy would be so loyal and dedicated to Adam.  By the way he already is, and will be devoted to Adam for the rest of his life. Jeston says: February 22, 2011 at 6:01 pm Itâs too bad that Adam didnât get the whole story! IN fact some cray fans who have taken their fantasy too far wanting Adam to marry Tommy were upset because Adam was seen with a new guy, Sauli! Tommyâs fans started hating on Adam and on this poor Sauli guy and the Sauli fans reacted, only one troll was really hating on Tommy but Adam reacted to that! Glad he put the fans in place and told them that they need to quit dwelling into his personal life and set the record straight that the stage antics between him and Tommy or anyone else on stage was just an ACT, nothing more! These cray need to get a life and stop harassing Adam with their Tommy love, itâs so ridiculous!! #getoneofyourown camala says: February 22, 2011 at 6:57 pm Tommy and Adam donât make a perfect couple. Tommy is straight. how in the world would you know if Tommy and Adam were soul mates. Adam is an entertainer, and when Adam kissed Tommy in concert, he was giving people what they wanted. I love Adam Lambert and I have never followed anyone like this before, and I wish people would just let him live his life, heâs a big boy magsmagenta says: February 22, 2011 at 7:07 pm @Juliette, itâs comments like this that are a major part of the problem, Adam and Tommy will never be an item because Tommy is STRAIGHT, you have been told this repeatedly from the beginning  by Adam and Tommy themselves. Tommy is Adams good friend and not his romantic partner. Many of the nasty comments thrown at Tommy seem to have been to the effect that he should come out as Gay, and compete with Sauli for the position as Adams Boyfriend (correct me if Iâm wrong but thatâs what I saw) You really need to get your head out of the clouds and face reality before your delusion does some real harm, Fantasize all you like but donât expect reality to conform to the fantasy especially if the fantasy is based on real lives and real people who have minds of their own. Yes Tommy is very sweet and pretty, I like him a lot, but so is Sauli, and Sauli is gay and therefore much more likely to be Adams boyfriend and we all just have to accept that Adam chooses his own friends and boyfriend according to his heart, not because silly teenage girls want the world to be like the Fan ficton theyâre reading/writing. Not that there is anything wrong with Fan Fiction as long as itâs all in fun, but Iâve also seen that used to hurt people by putting in the people they donât like as bad characters. Fiction always shows more about the character of the writer than the people written about. Glambert3911 says: February 22, 2011 at 8:33 pm Juliette, Adam has spelled it out for you in black & white and you still hold on to YOUR fantasy. Hereâs a reality check. Tommy prefers Girls heâs not interested in falling in love & marrying Adam. Adam prefers Boys and thatâs why he is now dating some ONE who has the same interests. It is not our business as fans to choose matters of the heart for either one of them. Tommy & Adam are BUDDIES/FRIENDS,(just like Adam said many times) NOT soul mates, thereâs a big difference.Further moreâ¦yes Tommy is very sweet & cute. We can not deny that he & Adam look adorable togetherâ¦yes there is a great chemistry between them on Stage. That is why Tommy was hired!!! Tommy knew from the get go that there was going to be some Stage Antics involved and he as a Rocker/Performer was open to the whole idea and willing to go along for the ride. How do I know, because Tommy himself told me. END OF STORY! Like Adam said âIt was all for Our Entertainmentâ. So please except this for what it is, thereâs really no other assumptions for fans to make. Did they enjoy the antics they got into on stageâ¦Hell Yes!!! as we the fans/audience enjoyed it too!!! But then after the show we all went back to our real lives, at least some of us did.I donât understand why so many young folks are so delusional? Itâs ok to have fantasies and a strong imagination, but it is vital in life to be able to separate Truth from fiction. Surly you donât still believe in Santa Clause and the Tooth Fairy !!! Pamela says: March 7, 2011 at 9:34 pm This is to all the naysayers out there…Grow Up!…It has been a long time since an artist with the ultimate talent that Adam Lambert is blessed with has come along. He truly has brought music back into my life and I am grateful. I had forgotten what a terrific stress relief it can be in this crazy world of today. To all the small minded people out there: get on board with the great music or be left behind! Marissa says: June 22, 2011 at 2:15 pm you know what, I am a fan of both of them. but I am just going to say that they need space like we do. it is their life. all celebrities are people too. and some of you need to realize that. they both have wonderful talent, and they both deserve their personal life, and a better future. what ever happens they will have a very good friendship. fans are great to have. I should say, just try not to make them both feel unhappy with each other. Cookie Mama says: August 5, 2011 at 12:33 am Why would people hate on Tommy? I understand that just because some people are fans of Adam doesnât mean the have to like Tommy and that people are entitled to their opinion, but some of the things said about him were just plain spiteful! Sometimes, itâs best to hold your tongue, people.Further, I donât understand why people would say such bad things about a person in general. Do you think that because you were mean to them that they will automatically do whatever it is that you want them to do, just to keep you-some unnamed douche bag somewhere on Earth-happy? God gave you a brain, so use it. Ana FontÃ£o says: February 19, 2012 at 1:22 pm To all who are against tommy fu** you. nobody can say or have in their personal lives the two, if they want to be lovers are nobody has to do with it Ana FontÃ£o says: February 19, 2012 at 1:24 pm They make a perfect couple haley says: May 4, 2012 at 7:47 pm adam and miley do not look good together miley is so ugly. BossBishGlambert says: June 10, 2012 at 12:11 am I love as much as anyone else the kissing that Adam decides he wants to do with tommy on stage and such. I know that tommy is straight and I believe that he actually is, but likes to have a good time with his friend. Theyâre just having fun and doing what they want, so who the hell cares what everyone else thinks?! People shouldnât be giving Adam or tommy crap because they are adults and can do as they please. I write fan fiction, and itâs nice to have a creative and sexy view of the two actually being a couple on that website, but I know itâs not reality, and others should realize the same. Stick to your imaginations, people… Tommy is STRAIGHT and we canât do anything to change that, only he can decide who he wants, and clearly we all must accept his choice(: <3 Sorry for the rant xD Kristina Cipciarova says: August 21, 2012 at 4:57 am I donât think that a man who is “straight”  would kiss an other man only for entertainment. he can be bi. think about it. it is not fiction. Heather says: June 8, 2014 at 3:25 am I canât believe people would be mean to Tommy. He is so sweet and talented and Adams good friend. Donât hate because they not a couple. Love them for what you know they are which is very gifted performers who know what the crowd wants onstage and brings it. Its just an act. Kristina many actors portray roles in movies where they have to kiss same sex people. And many of them are straight in real life. Its their job as actors and performers. Same thing for Tommy. katelyn says: July 17, 2014 at 12:07 am omg i cant belive it! tommy is the best bass player ever! why would people be so mean and give him grief….ps i love tommy and adam :) u guys are the best Kelbel says: August 5, 2014 at 2:00 pm I have no idea what this is about but Tommy does seem so sweet and adorable.   Adam love Tommy.   Not like that.  Iâm glad Adam is such a good friend.  Leave Tommy aline. alan says: November 5, 2014 at 10:10 am adam and tommy look good together .. !!!! David Saunders says: April 27, 2017 at 11:23 am Itâs April 27th 2017 - 11:17am I just came across all this crap. Update Adam is starting a USA tour with Queen this June than a world tour.Tommy is no longer with the band. Saulie long replaced! David Saunders says: April 27, 2017 at 11:41 am Reply to my reply. Miley is beautiful. Adam Levin has never said he was sorry to Adam. Clay Aiken is nuts! In 2015 Adam Lambert made over 10 million dollars according to Forbes. Marlene says: August 2, 2019 at 8:06 am Adam looked scared in that picture with Mikey. sylvia Brigman says: March 24, 2020 at 4:50 am KEEP DOING YOUR THING. CAUSE YOU AND BAND DO IT GREAT maddison says: July 16, 2020 at 8:54 am anyone still here in 2020 right after their friendship stopped? oh this year is too  much just end alreadyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
