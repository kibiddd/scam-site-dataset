It may have over the top characters and story lines, but that's why everyone loves it. Unfortunatley series 2 has now finished with a wicked cliffhanger of an ending, but i know that most of the UK can't wait for the third series to start. The guys are all gorgeous and the girl's outfits simply divine... I kinda of have a love- hate relationship with Tanya Turner, but she is definently the most interesting character in the show...so come on ITV, bring back Footballer's Wives - SOON!GlamourRockMar 1, 2003PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ17How many seasons does Footballers' Wives have?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJanuary 8, 2002 (United Kingdom)Country of originUnited KingdomOfficial sitesITV (United Kingdom)ITV2 (United Kingdom)LanguageEnglishAlso known asFootballers Wive$Filming locationsChigwell, Essex, England, UKProduction companiesCarlton TelevisionShed ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime49 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Spanish language plot outline for Footballers' Wives (2002)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
