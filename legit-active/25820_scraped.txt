our storyIt all starts at our farms.
The art of taste begins with caring for the land. Our signature coffee is Conquista grown in the southern highland areas of the state of Bahia, Brazil. Low impact farming has always been a priority for our family. Our coffee is grown using drip-irrigation technology developed at Colorado State University, with water from rivers that run through our farms. Large areas of timber have been left untouched to protect wildlife and preserve the microclimate of the region. The high altitude and annual rainfall in this location provide growing conditions favorable to fine coffee. To insure the highest quality roasts, we hand pick exclusive crops exported to Café Richesse. It's simple. Our farms. Our coffee.
