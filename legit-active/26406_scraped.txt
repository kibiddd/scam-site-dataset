Boston (horse)
Boston (1833–1850), was an outstanding chestnut Thoroughbred racehorse and a Leading sire in North America three times from 1851 to 1853. He started in about 45 races, winning 40 of these, including 15 in succession. Boston was later one of the initial inductees into the Hall of Fame.
Breeding
He was a chestnut stallion with a white blaze on his nose and he was foaled in Richmond, Virginia. Boston was bred by the Virginia attorney John Wickham (who had been Aaron Burr's counsel in his trial for treason).  He was by the very good racehorse, Timoleon (by the great Sir Archy), his dam was Sister to Tuckahoe by Ball’s Florizel.  Boston was inbred to Diomed in the third generation (3m x 3f). He was a half-brother to the Shylock mare who founded a successful family. They were from the number 40 family which traced back to the imported mare, Kitty Fisher.
As a two-year-old, Boston was lost by his breeder in a card game and was given to Wickham's friend Nathaniel Rives, of Richmond to repay his debt of $800.  He was named after a popular card game and later given the nickname of "Old Whitenose". Boston had a wilful temperament and was difficult to train. Sent to the stable of John Belcher, and then to the trainer L. White, and then back to Belcher, White said, "The horse should either be castrated or shot—preferably the latter."

Lanolin hills
That move me
To your will
Exposed to the soil
Everything is moving in slow motion got a feeling I could die for it, die for it
Waves that leap up to the surface, percolate & burst & let me lie on it, lie on it
Imbue me with your love
Share me with desperate blood
Like horses dancing through the fields
Through water dark as lye
You start to multiply and soak me to the bone until I’m yours

BOSTON COCKTAIL RECIPE - Must Try Apricot Brandy Liqueur Drink!
The Boston cocktail is a citrusy and tart gin-based cocktail with underlying and lingering apricot stone fruit flavours. It's a great drink to showcase your chosen apricot brandy. Note that the recipe may need adjusting depending on the chosen apricot brandy (liqueur) as they will vary in sweetness.

The Best Ward Eight - a Boston classic
Today we're making the Ward Eight! This classic drink hails from Boston, but recipes will differ. I like this recipe the best - just whiskey, citrus, and grenadine. Because the build is so simple, it's important to use fresh juice and a quality grenadine. I like a homemade grenadine in the Ward Eight because it has a tart pomegranate flavor that store bought grenadines tend to lack. Of course nothing's stopping you from using whatever grenadine you want, but I do think homemade is the way to go. I'll leave an easy recipe below so you can decide which is best for the Ward Eight! Cheers!

The Boston Cocktail
Marrying G'vine gin with Apricot Brandy dancing in lemon juice and a dash of grenadine and you've got a nice Boston Cocktail. Semi-sour taste worth the sipping, color worth the cocktail.

Boston Cocktail - Kuinka se tehdään?
Huikean maukas ja tasapainoinen drinkki.
Tässä käytin Japaninaprikoosi -likööriä, joka on hieman kirpeämpi
kuin ne, joita esim. Alkon hyllyltä löytyy.
Suosittelen kokeilemaan, nam!
Boston Cocktail
- 45 ml giniä
- 30 ml aprikoosilikööriä
- 20 ml sitruunamehua (tuoreena, tietenkin)
- 7,5 ml Grenadiinia
(- 7,5 ml sokerisiirappia)
Ravistetaan jäiden kera ja tarjotaan jäähdytetystä coupe- tai martinilasista
Juokaa vastuullisesti.

Which cocktail shaker is the best for your home bar? We pitted 5 of the most popular shakers against each other: The Boston Shaker, The 2 Tin Shaker, The Cobbler, The OXO Shaker, and The Elevated Craft.
We've used A TON of different cocktail shakers over the years, so it was particularly enjoyable to finally sit down and evaluate each one.
After a thorough evaluation, we came up with a handful of recommendations for your home bar dependent on which style and advantages you care about most.

Lanolin hills
That move me
To your will
Exposed to the soil
Everything is moving in slow motion got a feeling I could die for it, die for it
Waves that leap up to the surface, percolate & burst & let me lie on it, lie on it
Imbue me with your love
Share me with desperate blood
Like horses dancing through the fields
Through water dark as lye
You start to multiply and soak me to the bone until I’m yours
Everything is moving in slow motion got a feeling I could die for it, die for it
Waves that leap up to the surface, percolate & burst & let me lie on it, lie on it

The Boston cocktail is a citrusy and tart gin-based cocktail with underlying and lingering apricot stone fruit flavours. It's a great drink to showcase your chosen apricot brandy. Note that the recipe may need adjusting depending on the chosen apricot brandy (liqueur) as they will vary in sweetness.

Today we're making the Ward Eight! This classic drink hails from Boston, but recipes will differ. I like this recipe the best - just whiskey, citrus, and grenadine. Because the build is so simple, it's important to use fresh juice and a quality grenadine. I like a homemade grenadine in the Ward Eight because it has a tart pomegranate flavor that store bought grenadines tend to lack. Of course nothing's stopping you from using whatever grenadine you want, but I do think homemade is the way to go. I'll leave an easy recipe below so you can decide which is best for the Ward Eight! Cheers!

Which cocktail shaker is the best for your home bar? We pitted 5 of the most popular shakers against each other: The Boston Shaker, The 2 Tin Shaker, The Cobbler, The OXO Shaker, and The Elevated Craft.
We've used A TON of different cocktail shakers over the years, so it was particularly enjoyable to finally sit down and evaluate each one.
After a thorough evaluation, we came up with a handful of recommendations for your home bar dependent on which style and advantages you care about most.

Huikean maukas ja tasapainoinen drinkki.
Tässä käytin Japaninaprikoosi -likööriä, joka on hieman kirpeämpi
kuin ne, joita esim. Alkon hyllyltä löytyy.
Suosittelen kokeilemaan, nam!
Boston Cocktail
- 45 ml giniä
- 30 ml aprikoosilikööriä
- 20 ml sitruunamehua (tuoreena, tietenkin)
- 7,5 ml Grenadiinia
(- 7,5 ml sokerisiirappia)
Ravistetaan jäiden kera ja tarjotaan jäähdytetystä coupe- tai martinilasista
Juokaa vastuullisesti.
