The Best of the Best
NAFL Hall of Fame - In 2004, Week 1 of the newly-christened North American Football League, the stars were already shining. Tom Brady led the Patriots past an AFC East rival, Peyton Manning threw for over 500 yards for the Colts, Steven Jackson had a nice day as the Rams won easily... Now with so many seasons in our past and spectacular performances each and every day, the NAFL has a legacy of greatness, elite players, coaches and general managers who have shaped the course of football history. They are more than just names on a box score; they are our memories of gridiron glory. Here, we honor those influential few, the Best of the Best in NAFL history.
