Peter Graves was also upset that Jim Phelps was portrayed as a double-agent.GoofsMultiple episodes set in European countries have Barney working on electrical wiring to achieve the team's aim, yet the switchgear, outlets, and other equipment depicted is North American.Quotes[repeated line] Voice on Tape: As always, should you or any of your IM force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Good luck, Jim. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.Crazy creditsOnly two things stayed unchanged in the opening: the striking of the match
and the actual display of the title.	The rest of the opening title showed
clips which varied from episode to episode.ConnectionsEdited into The Green Fog (2017)User reviews68ReviewFeatured reviewThe theater of the manipulation"Mission : impossible" is the most complex espionage series ever conceived. What makes this show so unique ? It is its storyline, its characters, its visual style and its music : a real trade mark. What I like the most is first the ritual : the tape, the dossier and the apartment briefing, then the fast-paced clips as credits, the character of Martin Landau with his masks and gimmicks, the cinematography (very quick cuts, extreme close ups as inserts, the use of special lenses, pan-and-tilt shots, upside-down camera shots, hand-held camera shots, optical zoom shots as dramatic effects), the skillful montage, and finally, the music and its various themes. The show is an impeccable and Machiavellian play. Every details are planned in advance to fool and get rid of the enemy. Each scheming is tight and shocking. I like the use of the time warp concept in "Operation Rogosh" and the role of Fritz Weaver as the paranoid Soviet Union spy trapped in a fake Russian prison which is in California. I like the tension and the suspense created by silent actions. Anyway, the whole show is about simulacrum. The devious methods of the IMF agents are always delightful and clever. Don't miss the best episodes : "The mind of Stephan Miklos", "Live bait" and "The interrogator". This tape will self-destruct in five seconds, good luck. !urickApr 23, 1999PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How many seasons does Mission: Impossible have?Powered by AlexaWho composed the Mission Impossible theme music?DetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 17, 1966 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asKobra, übernehmen SieFilming locationsParamount Studios - 5555 Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA(seasons 2 to 7)Production companyDesilu ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime50 minutesColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
