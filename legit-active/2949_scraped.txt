a 30-year period from 1951 to 1979. He was one of those wonderful
character actors who would be a crooked judge in one film and a
humorous cavalry officer in another. He appeared in many of
John Ford's movies as well as
James Stewart's films. His
longevity resulted, in part, due to his professionalism and acting
ability. He always provided a fine performance no matter how small or
insignificant the role.- IMDb Mini Biography By: vjohnson@eticomm.netAmerican character actor primarily of pompous or officious types, long
a favorite supporting player for John Ford. Bouchey was born in or near
Vernon, Michigan but raised by his mother and stepfather in the state
of Washington. He entered films in 1951 at the age of 44 and quickly
became a familiar (if unnameable) fixture in movies and television. He
died in 1977.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>FamilySpouseThelma Evelyn Maggart(December 2, 1933 - September 27, 1977) (his death)TriviaIn The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), he delivers the memorable
last line: "Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.".Bouchey's talent and meticulous attention to every detail to his character's role made him a staple of many shows, especially CBS. One such show was "Perry Mason." After the first time he was cast for the show in 1960, he became the first one asked if the part of the judge was substantial. Bouchey's voice projected well, the part of judge was one that fit his authoritative style perfectly, and his facial expressions and reactions were always well-suited for the moment.While some sources refer to an active career on Broadway before Bouchey entered films, the Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) lists no productions in which he appeared.His last name is pronounced: boo-SHAY.
