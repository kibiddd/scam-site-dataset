7 African American Mayors Under the Radar
We’ve all heard of the career-killing misdeeds of former mayors Kwame  Kilpatrick and Sheila Dixon. Once the media got hold of their stories,  they became household names. At the other extreme of national attention  is a superstar like Cory Booker.
But of course, the landscape of   African-American mayors is wider than that. The Atlanta Post rounds up  seven municipal leaders that, although are overlooked by the national  spotlight, have earned distinction (not all good) in their respective communities.
Mayor Byron Brown: Mayor Brown, a Democrat, started off slow in the violent and cold city  of Buffalo. With a campaign focused on abolishing crime and poverty,  Brown made efforts to be a part of Buffalo’s firearms solution, helping  the city’s homicide rate plummet 20 percent. His secondary problem,  poverty, forced him to set aside funds for demolishing abandoned  buildings and clean up trash. With Brown persuading the city to install  cameras on street corners, Buffalo’s murder rate shot down 50 percent by  early 2009. Controversy has also surrounded this mayor, as well as his  aides and business partners, but no charges have been filed.
