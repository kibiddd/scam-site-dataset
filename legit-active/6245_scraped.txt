This volume collects the best of her early pieces, including her first published story, "Madeline's Birthday", which introduces the prototype of many confused characters so constantly on the move they are no longer certain where they are: "The days of her lifetime had been spent in so many different places that the first sight of day was, almost by habit, bewildering." The collection meanders from Montreal to Manhattan and takes an austere tour of postwar Europe before ultimately settling, like the author, in Paris; no one has written better about fustian Left Bank hotels, fetid air rising from Métro grilles, and bohemian trollops straight out of Degas paintings: "Girls staring out of the flat canvas who, for two pins . . . would stick out their tongue or spit in your face." As Jhumpa Lahiri says in her introduction: "Never have characters adrift been so effectively anchored."Explore more on these topicsFictionreviewsComments (…)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
