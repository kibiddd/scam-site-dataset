Roy Williams closed his worst season at UNC with an NIT finals loss to Dayton. The Tar Heels must improve this year without Deon Thompson.
BY GRANT FITZGERALD
STAFF WRITER
Moral victories just won’t cut it anymore. Not for a school that has  been to the Final Four 18 times. Not for a coach already enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Not for a rabid fanbase two years removed from a national champi-onship.That was a lesson the players of the North Carolina men’s basket- ball team learned the hard way last  year. All the members of last year’s NIT runner-up squad know that this year must not resemble last season’s record. They know that second place in the NIT, maybe a moral victory at other schools, is an embarrassment at UNC.“Last year wasn’t fun for any- body,” junior point guard Larry Drew II said. “Coaches, players, I feel like the whole state of North Carolina, nobody had a good time.”The season’s failure left a bad taste in the mouth of coach Roy  Williams, who failed to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time during his tenure at UNC.“I don’t think I’m ever going to forget what happened last year,”  Williams said. “I don’t think I’m ever going to put it out of my mind.”But how does a team with no scholarship seniors rebound from a disastrous season? The answer may depend on whom you ask. Drew, whom much of the blame for last season centered on after the Tar Heels finished last in the  ACC in turnover margin, used the offseason to work around the clock on improving in the gym. “With so much negativity, you  just try to find a silver lining,” Drew said. “For me, it was just getting in the gym and just making a promise to myself that I wasn’t going to go through that again.”Sophomore John Henson points to something a little more intangi- ble. The power forward believes the team will benefit from improved chemistry. “I think we’re just a lot closer in age, and we made that an empha-sis to kind of do things together and always be together and work out together,” Henson said. “That’s something we made a conscious effort to improve.”Disappointed in his team’s toughness last season, Williams  brought back a conditioning pro-gram from 1981 with which he used to test the likes of Michael Jordan and Sam Perkins.  Williams also pointed to an increase in his team’s ability to put the ball in the basket. The Tar Heels ranked second-to-last in the conference in field goal percent-age and seventh in scoring offense  when playing ACC opponents. Williams’ team frequently ranked among the top offensive units in the league and the coun-try. But scoring should rise with the addition of three high-profile freshman, including preseason All- American Harrison Barnes.“We have an ability to score,”  Williams said. “Coaches love to talk about diving on the floor and drawing charges, but that thing that hangs from the ceiling or is attached to the wall up there is called a scoreboard, and we couldn’t score.” All those improvements sound great in writing, but for Henson, the hard work manifested itself in  August during the Tar Heels’ bas-ketball excursion to the Bahamas.“There were times in the Bahamas when I was sitting on the bench and I was watching this and we hit like three or four threes and a couple layups, so that kind of  brought me back to how Carolina plays,” he said.But as the season approaches, the pressure to rectify last season increases exponentially.“There’s probably going to be more pressure this year, because  we got to prove something this  year,” sophomore Leslie McDonald said. “We found that little bond together and we feel like with us  working together and us doing stuff together, we’re going to take this challenge.”

STAFF WRITER
It’s a brand-new atmosphere and a brand-new season. And the North Carolina women’s basketball team can’t wait to take advantage of its fresh start.Last year, the team finished with a winning record and an NCAA tournament bid.But the 2009-10 campaign is one nobody on the UNC squad  wants to remember.“I don’t think I’ve had a sea-son like that ever,” senior Cetera DeGraffenreid said. “We came here because we like winning, and … I think last year (we were) more focusing on games we were los-ing.”The Tar Heels finished 6-8 in the ACC last season and lost five consecutive conference games in February. To add to the disap-pointments, freshmen and top recruits Cierra Robertson-Warren and Nyree Williams transferred from UNC to join other Division I programs.The 13-woman roster might be missing four old faces, but with experienced leaders returning, the Tar Heels remain hopeful.“We’re not that young anymore, and we kind of have our heads on straight now,” senior forward Jessica Breland said. “So we’re going to go for what we know we can get. The sky is the limit. It’s on us.”Back on the court after battling Hodgkin’s lymphoma during the 2009-10 season, Breland is deter-mined to pick up where she left off as the unmistakable leader of the Tar Heel team. The 6-foot-3 for- ward said she is in nearly tip-top shape. And she’s not the only one who thinks so.Breland was named to the pre-season All-ACC team and was selected as a Wooden preseason top 30 along with Tar Heel senior Italee Lucas.Seniors Lucas, Breland and DeGraffenreid — all of whom have scored more than 1,000 points during their careers at UNC — lead this year’s squad in experience. But coach Sylvia Hatchell is expect-ing huge contributions from her underclassmen.Shannon Smith, a 5-foot-7 freshman guard from Gastonia, is a two-time 3A State Championship Most Outstanding Player and aver-aged 23 points and seven assists per game during her senior year at Gastonia’s Forestview High School.Sophomore Waltiea Rolle start-ed 15 games and led the ACC in  blocks per game last season, and Hatchell said there’s more where that came from — much more. The 35-year veteran coach said Rolle’s confidence has grown to fit her tall frame.“This time last year out there,  Waltiea was 6-foot-7 but she was like a stick out there just getting  bounced around all over the place,” Hatchell said.“Now she’s the one doing the knocking. She along with all the other ones, they’re just really physi-cally stronger.”Hatchell said she looks forward to hosting Iowa for the Big Ten/ACC Challenge and two-time defending national champions Connecticut in a renovated Carmichael Arena, but  what she’s most excited about are the hopes she holds for her much-improved team.Ousted in the first round of last  year’s NCAA Tournament with an 82-76 loss to Gonzaga, the Tar Heels ended a disappointing sea-son with an uncharacteristic early exit from the national champion-ship hunt. But that’s all behind them now. “(They learned) not to take any-thing for granted,” Hatchell said. “Just because they are wearing the Carolina uniform, they’ve got to make it happen, it’s not just going to happen.“Last year is over. We learned from it, we move on, and hope-fully the best is yet to come,” she said.
