22-23 Season Recap:  The Quest of 4 Straight Sectional Titles Falls Short
While there may be some disappointment in the overall outcome of the season, it still was a very successful season for a variety of reasons.  The Trojans were defeated in the 1st round of Sectional 14 by Columbus East, ending a 3-year (9-0) Sectional run for the graduating class of '23.
Along the way, the Trojans were able to capture their 3rd straight EIAC title, their 4th in the past five seasons, and a combined 34-1 record in conference games during that 5-year span.  Additionally, the Trojans were selected to play in the historic New Castle gym as part of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame Classic in late December.  The Trojans faced the 21-22 4A state champion, Noblesville Millers, in the 1st round.  After getting off to a great start and leading after the 1st quarter, 18-10, the Millers dominated the rest of the way forcing the Trojans to play in the consolation game vs. Mishawaka Marian.  In the consoloation game, the Trojans were victorious and finished 3rd in the event.  This season the Trojans played their most difficult non-conference schedule they had ever had.  That level of competition led to an overall record of (15-11).  It's the 11th season in a row with 11 or more wins in a season.  The list of Indiana HS teams that have accomplished that feat is: Bedford North Lawrence, East Central, Homestead, and Penn.
This group of seniors is a special one.  Just like the senior classes to come before them, they took the standard of success and expanded it for the groups to come behind them.  They will be a group that is very difficult to replace and it's disappointing we weren't able to finish the job of the 4-Peat but it's a 4-year run that everyone will be able to look back on with great appreciation, enjoyment, and memories.
The 22-23 JV team finished the season at (17-3) and also won the EIAC JV division.  The group of sophomores and freshman competed extremely hard at the defensive end and started to expand their offensive abilities as the season progressed.   With the graduation of (7) seniors, and only (2) returning Varsity players, this group of kids will be pressed into Varsity action next season.

***IF anyone would like information about AAU teams or spring/summer basketball leagues (grades 3 - junior) in the area, tryout dates, etc. please click on the above AAU tab and/or email Coach Moore at coachmoore23@gmail.com and he will get you the necessary information.  AAU Tryouts are typically in the fall for the following spring!
AAU Basketball & Multiple-Sport Athletes
Multiple-Sport: The East Central Girls' Basketball Coaching Staff highly encourages our student-athletes to play another sport (or sports) besides just basketball. All to often in youth sports, kids/families are encouraged by some club coaches and/or high school coaches to concentrate on one sport (soccer, basketball, softball, volleyball, etc.), which is absolutely absurd. There are those few that just play basketball, which allows them the opportunity to get in the gym more frequently than others, however that doesn't mean they are always the better basketball players or it is the right choice!
AAU:
Whether you are a young basketball player or a high school player, AAU basketball is an outstanding option to play this great game outside of the season.  Typically clubs have tryouts in the fall or early winter months so don't wait too long to contact them or research options regarding tryout information.
Not every player does have the opportunity to play basketball in the spring/summer due to their schedule (softball, track, soccer, etc.), but for those that do have the time and desire, it is a terrific way to get exposure to the best talent, let the college coaches see you play (especially important to HS and MS kids if you want to play at the college level), and most importantly it allows you to improve your skills before heading into the summer schedule and eventual winter basketball season.
However, you have to be careful and not get caught up in the belief that you have to play AAU to improve or you have to play AAU to be considered a "good" player.   In reality, there are some kids that just have that "it" quality on the court while some that play all the time just lack that, regardless of how much they practice/play.  Trust me, I've seen some very poor AAU teams/players but more times than not, the kids are benefiting from the experience and are playing because they love the game, the competition, and they have a desire to improve.  The best way to improve is to get a ball in their hands (AAU or not) and have them work hard!
Lastly, if your ultimate goal is to play college basketball, it’s going to be very difficult to do that if you are not playing on the AAU circuit.  However, when you decide to go that route is different for everyone based on a wide variety of factors.  Anyone that tells you that a player needs to play AAU as early 3rd and 4th grade if they want to play college basketball is completely incorrect.
Here is a list of current and former East Central Program players that have played AAU or plan on playing AAU and the Club they did/will belong to:
Indiana Pride: Laney Baker
Indiana Elite: Josie Trabel, Brilan McCory, Charsan McCory
