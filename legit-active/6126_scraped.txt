SOS Past Articles now online (back to January 1994)
Like many pros, when taking a break from mixing, Paul Hardcastle likes to read his personal copy of Sound On Sound magazine.
Can't find a certain Sound On Sound article?
We finally added the remaining 3,714 past issue articles! We thank you for your patience. Some of the early years are text-only web articles, missing their images (the DAT data backups of which we discovered were lost in a previous office relocation!).
This current incarnation of the SOS web site currently hosts 16,436 independent, high quality, in-depth test reviews / techniques / interviews and tutorials  — plus over 5,200 News stories (more added daily) and 742,083 SOS Forum posts (more added daily). We add more articles every month and publish News every day.
But what about Sound On Sound issues from November 1985 (Issue 1) to December 1993 you ask? Well, these can currently be found on the superb www.muzines.co.uk  website (with our full permission), and we're hoping to get the text and images from these articles onto our own website at some point in the future. That's another Herculean task for us to solve!
Try our Full Issue PDF (for free - no catch!)
