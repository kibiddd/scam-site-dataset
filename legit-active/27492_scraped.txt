Persephone's Bees – Walk To The Moon                                lyrics
I think I'll walk to the moon
I don't think I'll be back soon
I'll take some water and time
And I'll find, yes, I'll be fine
I might be happy at last
I might enjoy while it lasts
'cause when you realize
It's too late
Yes, it's too late
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
I think I'll make friends with rain
It will wash off my pain
When I'm ready to go
Come say goodbye
And maybe once in a while
I'll send you my happy smile
When you're ready to go
Don't say goodbye
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Hey, my friend
Give me your hand
And I'll take you
I'll take you there
Straight to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon
Ooo, I
I'll walk to the moon...
