The Besnard Lakes - Albatross Lyrics
Artist: The Besnard Lakes
Album: The Besnard Lakes Are the Roaring Night
Genre: Rock
Heyo! SONGLYRICS just got interactive. Highlight. Review: RIFF-it.  RIFF-it good.
Sad tyrant, turn on a dime
In the sultry west coast night
Hopping along skid row
Amongst the hopeful and their junk
You showed me so much
Took us to a new high
Speeding along in a clean machine
Riding the wake of another
One so mean
Those days are now long gone
Wish I had your picture
Memory will do the trick
So I wanted, I wanted
I wanted to help you
And I have to admit things got weird for a bit
And I screamed for you,
"There goes my man!"
