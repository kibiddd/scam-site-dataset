A popular host of television specials due to his off-the-cuff wit, Crystal is known in Hollywood for his talent as well as for his dedication to his wife and two daughters.Raised on Long Island, Crystal was attracted to the idea of performing at an early age, and he and his two brothers would perform shtick for their relatives in his grandmother's living room during family gatherings. He came to the attention of national audiences with his portrayal of Jodie Dallas, one of television's first recurring homosexual characters, in the series Soap, a situation comedy popular during the late 1970s and early 1980s.In 1984 Crystal joined the cast of Saturday Night Live, creating the character Fernando, a superficial nightclub performer for whom everything is "mahvelous." His high-profile role on the popular late-night show established Crystal as one of the leading comic talents of the decade, and his autobiography, published as Absolutely Mahvelous, draws upon the popularity of the Fernando character. In Absolutely Mahvelous, the comic actor tells of his childhood and youth, and describes with humor his years working on tour as a stand-up comedian. While a critic for Publishers Weekly found Crystal's account
count of his youth and early career "uneventful," a Booklist contributor called Absolutely Mahvelous "brief but very funny."In addition to television work, Crystal has starred in several films, including When Harry Met Sally …, a comic and sentimental look at love and New York City; he also portrays an urban dweller vacationing at a dude ranch in City Slickers. Crystal, who contributed to the screenplay of City Slickers, also authored a sequel, City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold, which was released in 1994. More recent films have included 1999's Analyze This and the sequel, Analyze That, both which star Robert De Niro as a mob boss attempting to get in touch with his kinder, gentler side with the help of reluctant psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobel (Crystal).While Crystal has sometimes been described by critics as too sentimental, the comic actor notes that he is too happy in his personal life to create the bitter, cutting-edge humor popular with some audiences. As a reflection of his contentment with family and friends, Crystal penned the 2004 book I Already Know I Love You, a picture book for young children inspired by his anticipation of his first grandchild, Ella. Written in simple rhyme, the book is narrated by a grandfather awaiting the birth of a grandchild who is depicted sometimes as a boy and sometimes as a girl. While several reviewers remarked that I Already Know I Love You is a less-than-effective picture book due to its clumsy rhyme and what a Publishers Weekly contributor described as the actor's characteristic "unabashed sentimental[ity]," critics agreed that the theme of the book would make it attractive as a gift book from doting grandparents.Biographical and Critical SourcesPERIODICALSAmerican Film, July-August, 1989, pp. 30-33, 48.Booklist, August, 1986, p. 1648.Cosmopolitan, June, 1986, p. 80.Daily Variety, May 19, 2001, Michael Schneider, "Crystal Clear Deal," p. 5; August 22, 2003, Nicole LaPorte, "Crystal's Family Addition Inspires Kids' Tome," p. 4.Entertainment Weekly, June 17, 1994, pp. 26-29.Gentlemen's Quarterly, August, 1989, p. 199.Kirkus Reviews, April 1, 2004, review of I Already Know I Love You, p. 327.Life, July, 1989, p. 68; April, 1990, p. 90.McCall's, July, 1991, p. 58.People, September 30, 1985, p. 40.Publishers Weekly, July 11, 1986, p. 59; March 15, 2004, review of I Already Know I Love You, p. 72.Rolling Stone, October 24, 1985, p. 49.Time, October, 19, 1992, pp. 66-68.TV Guide, November 15, 1980, p. 30; March 24, 1990, p. 5.* Something About the Author  ×  Cite this article   Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.

A popular host of television specials due to his off-the-cuff wit, Crystal is known in Hollywood for his talent as well as for his dedication to his wife and two daughters.Raised on Long Island, Crystal was attracted to the idea of performing at an early age, and he and his two brothers would perform shtick for their relatives in his grandmother's living room during family gatherings. He came to the attention of national audiences with his portrayal of Jodie Dallas, one of television's first recurring homosexual characters, in the series Soap, a situation comedy popular during the late 1970s and early 1980s.In 1984 Crystal joined the cast of Saturday Night Live, creating the character Fernando, a superficial nightclub performer for whom everything is "mahvelous." His high-profile role on the popular late-night show established Crystal as one of the leading comic talents of the decade, and his autobiography, published as Absolutely Mahvelous, draws upon the popularity of the Fernando character. In Absolutely Mahvelous, the comic actor tells of his childhood and youth, and describes with humor his years working on tour as a stand-up comedian. While a critic for Publishers Weekly found Crystal's account of his youth and early career "uneventful," a Booklist contributor called Absolutely Mahvelous "brief but very funny."In addition to television work, Crystal has starred in several films, including When Harry Met Sally . . . , a comic and sentimental look at love and New York City; he also portrays an urban dweller vacationing at a dude ranch in City Slickers. Crystal, who contributed to the screenplay of City Slickers, also authored a sequel, City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold, which was released in 1994. More recent films have included 1999's Analyze This and the sequel, Analyze That, both which star Robert De Niro as a mob boss attempting to get in touch with his kinder, gentler side with the help of reluctant psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobel, played by Crystal.While Crystal has sometimes been described by critics as too sentimental, the comic actor notes that he is too happy in his personal life to create the bitter, cutting-edge humor popular with some audiences. As a reflection of his contentment with family and friends, Crystal penned the 2004 book I Already Know I Love You, a picture book for young children inspired by his anticipation of his first grandchild, Ella. Written in simple rhyme, the book is narrated by a grandfather awaiting the birth of a grandchild who is depicted sometimes as a boy and sometimes as a girl. While several reviewers remarked that I Already Know I Love You is a less-than-effective picture book due to its clumsy rhyme and what a Publishers Weekly contributor described as the actor's characteristic "unabashed sentimental[ity]," several critics thought that the theme of the book would make it attractive as a gift book from doting grandparents.BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:PERIODICALSAmerican Film, July-August, 1989, pp. 30-33, 48.Booklist, August, 1986, p. 1648.Cosmopolitan, June, 1986, p. 80.Daily Variety, May 19, 2001, Michael Schneider, "Crystal Clear Deal," p. 5; August 22, 2003, Nicole LaPorte, "Crystal's Family Addition Inspires Kids' Tome," p. 4.Entertainment Weekly, June 17, 1994, pp. 26-29.Gentlemen's Quarterly, August, 1989, p. 199.Kirkus Reviews, April 1, 2004, review of I Already Know I Love You, p. 327.Life, July, 1989, p. 68; April, 1990, p. 90.McCall's, July, 1991, p. 58.People, September 30, 1985, p. 40.Publishers Weekly, July 11, 1986, p. 59; March 15, 2004, review of I Already Know I Love You, p. 72.Rolling Stone, October 24, 1985, p. 49.Time, October, 19, 1992, pp. 66-68.TV Guide, November 15, 1980, p. 30; March 24, 1990, p. 5.* Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series  ×  Cite this article   Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.

His wry, skeptical attitude has made him an unlikely romantic hero, and his ability to combine nostaligia has led him to emcee the epitome of schmaltz and sincerity, the Academy Awards.Crystal was born in showbiz; his father managed the Colony record store in midtown Manhattan, and an uncle, Milt Gabler, was a jazz producer (according to family legend, Crystal was named for family friend Billie Holliday). Crystal attended Marshall University on a baseball scholarship, and later studied film at New York University under Martin Scorsese. His early professional work was as a mimic, and his loving impressions of Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell drew praise across the board. Steve Allen noted, "(H)e is more than merely an impressionist, because his essential comic quality is dominant, whereas most impressionists could not succeed as comedians if they did not employ the voices of well-known figures."Crystal was willing to risk embarrassment in his first major acting roles, playing the TV sitcom's first gay character on ABC's Soap (1977–81) and a pregnant male in Joan Rivers' over-the-top misfire Rabbit Test (1978). During the late 1970s Crystal developed a rapport with a group of cutting-edge comedians and satirists in Southern California, including Albert Brooks and Rob Reiner. And Crystal's monologues included such original characters as jazz musician "Face" and transsexual cabaret singer Penny Lane.In 1984 Crystal spent a productive season on NBC's Saturday Night Live, where his impressions of TV host Joe Franklin, laid-back actor Fernando Lamas, and superstar Sammy Davis, Jr. earned him widespread acclaim. Crystal immediately left the series to develop his film career. Running Scared (1986), directed by Peter Hyams, gave Crystal the chance to trade smart one-liners with cop sidekick Gregory Hines, and resolve his conflict with his estranged wife. Crystal gave Hines room to act, and he also was effective in the flim's romantic scenes. The Beverly Hills Cop-knockoff was a critical and box-office success.Crystal scored again in Danny DeVito's Throw Momma from the Train (1987), where his detachment on-screen played well opposite DeVito's matricidal character and Anne Ramsay's passive-aggressive mother. An often-overlooked Crystal movie is Memories of Me (1988, Henry Winkler), where his doctor character reconciles with his aging actor father (Alan King). Crystal co-wrote the script with Eric Roth, and the screenplay effectively switches between Borscht Belt humor and melodrama. Roger Ebert complimented King and Crystal's rapport: "Their timing has the almost effortless music of two professionals who have spent their lifetimes learning how to put the right spin on a word. . . Crystal is very good in a role that must have been second nature to him." Crystal would further explore the life of a middling Jewish-American showbiz character in his directorial debut, Mr. Saturday Night (1992), which resurrected his standup persona of insult-comic extraordinaire Buddy Young, Jr. ("Nice body odor, lady—you smell like landfill").Crystal's biggest hit to date was When Harry Met Sally. . . (1989), in which he winningly played Meg Ryan's platonic male friend over a 15-year span. Again, Crystal's generosity shone through; he consciously encouraged director Rob Reiner to make Ryan, not himself, the center of the movie's famous deli scene, a scene which catapulted Ryan to stardom. The Nora Ephron-scripted film owed much to Woody Allen films, but When Harry Met Sally. . . demanded more than one-liners to succeed. Crystal's genuinely touching reconciliation with Ryan the night after consummating their relationship gave the movie its strength.City Slickers (1991) allowed Crystal to hilariously explore the psyche of middle-aged men in the 1990s, as Crystal and his childhood buddies herd cattle as a metaphor for organizing their messy personal lives. In a potent early scene, Crystal poignantly describes the stages of life to his son's grade-school class; to paraphrase Lincoln, he cracks jokes because he must not cry. While out West he and his buddies reminisce about the past (including a touching discussion about baseball), match wits with mythical cowboy Jack Palance (Crystal: "Kill anybody today?" Palance, coldly: "Day ain't over yet"), and reconnect with their wives and families.Crystal scored his biggest hit of the late 1990s as the shrink of a neurotic Mob don in Analyze This (1999). Once again, Crystal willingly allowed his costar to get the laughs. In this case it was Robert De Niro, the protégé of Crystal's former mentor, Martin Scorsese. Crystal's reactions to De Niro's deadpan quips were priceless, and his presence complemented De Niro's. Though not in the same class with the similarly-themed TV series The Sopranos, Analyze This was a well-produced contemporary movie comedy.In 1990 Crystal was pegged to host the Academy Awards, a task that had daunted bigger names. In a series of hosting gigs during the 1990s Crystal proved to be the ceremony's best host since Bob Hope, with a crack writing staff backstage to take advantage of spontaneous on-stage goofs, the dexterity to sing and dance elaborate production numbers of each year's five Best Picture nominees, and a strong adlib ability (when 100-year-old honoree Hal Roach's microphone went dead during the 1992 ceremony, Crystal quipped that it was fitting, since Roach began with silent films).Crystal's most prominent flops have been City Slickers II (1994), a spiritless reworking of the original, and Father's Day (1997), an uninspired teaming with fellow comedian Robin Williams. These failures suggest that Crystal is better off exploring new subjects and collaborators. There's no reason Crystal can't appear on a future Oscar telecast—as a recipient.—Andrew Milner International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers Milner, Andrew ×  Cite this article   Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.

Crystal, Billy gale views  updated May 08 2018             CRYSTAL, BILLYCRYSTAL, BILLY (1947– ), U.S. actor. Born in New York, Crystal studied film and television direction under Martin Scorsese at New York University. He became known to television viewers as Jodie Dallas, the young homosexual in Soap, the satiric take-off on the soap opera genre (1977). In fact, Crystal made history by playing television's first openly gay character.As a stand-up comedian on the comedy circuit, Crystal became famous for his Fernando Lamas and Sammy Davis Jr. impersonations. In 1984 he joined the cast of Saturday Night Live. Although he spent only one year with the show, he was one of the most popular members of the cast and was nominated for an Emmy for Best Individual Performance.Crystal graduated to feature film work and built up a steady following with roles in This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Running Scared (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), Throw Momma from the Train (1987), and Memories of Me (1988), which Crystal co-scripted and co-produced with Alan *King. Crystal then catapulted to star status in the hugely popular When Harry Met Sally (1989), and he followed this with the equally successful City Slickers (1990). His next film was Mr. Saturday Night (1992), which he also directed. Subsequent films included City Slickers ii, which he wrote (1994); Forget Paris, which he wrote and directed (1995); Father's Day (1997); Deconstructing Harry (1997); My Giant (1998); Analyze This (1999); America's Sweethearts, which he wrote (2001); and Analyze That (2002).Crystal was the host of the annual Academy Award presentations in Hollywood from 1990 to 1993 as well as in 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2004. Widely acclaimed for his writing and performing talents, Crystal has won five Emmys and five American Comedy Awards, among many other honors and nominations. Crystal wrote Absolutely Mahvelous (with Dick Schaap, 1986), and the children's book I Already Know I Love You (2004).[Ruth Beloff (2nd ed.)] Encyclopaedia Judaica Beloff, Ruth ×  Cite this article   Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.
