But due to its relatively poor performance at the box office when it was first released, the producers decided not to finish the second part. The nameless character that appears in the last scene played by Tony Leung Chiu-wai is supposedly the main character in the second part.GoofsWhen Tide checks into the hotel, the hotel manageress hands him the key to Room 206. However, in the next scene, Tide uses the key to enter Room 204. This, however, may not be so much a 'goof' as another recurrence of the number '2046' seen so often in Wong Kar-Wai's films.QuotesYuddy: I used to think there was a kind of bird that, once born, would keep flying until death. The fact is that the bird hasn't gone anywhere. It was dead from the beginning.Alternate versionsA different 35mm print of the film features an altered prologue sequence and different edits during the final scenes of the film. This version decreases the length of the film from 95 to 94 minutes.ConnectionsFeatured in Nian ni ru xi (1997)SoundtracksJungle Drums (Cantonese cover)Music by Ernesto Lecuona & J. CacabasLyrics by Sharon ChungPerformed by Anita MuiUser reviews66ReviewFeatured reviewthree beautiful stories in one about quests for friendship - my favourite WKWThere is a two-minute action sequence, but that is NOT what this masterpiece is about.  'Days of being wild' has to be the best film of Wong Kar-Wai or at least MY favourite.  There are three stories (in one) that feel like film-noir now and then, but are principally about the distance in several different relationships.  Kar-Wai lets his characters struggle with urban loneliness and lets them search indefinitely, unable to settle down.  They only have the chance to create 'One Minute Friendships' that might seem magic but don't offer satisfaction and have to be ended.  The quest continues.  Won Kar-Wai poses the question whether you have lived actually when you've searched all your life for friendship/love.  Two or three voice-overs scarcely help the portrayal of the characters, but only when the story allows it.  I prefer this film over Chungking Express anytime.  One reason for that is the great use of music here, while his other films tend to drown in the excessive use of western music.  The acting is also really brilliant in this eclectic work.Subtle and masterly cinematography by Christopher Doyle (Chungking Express, Fallen Angels '95): less colorful than 'In the mood for love', but therefore more applicable for the fifties.  Moreover, the dynamics are also much more subtle than everything Kar-Wai and Doyle have done up till now.  In contrast: Happy Together and Fallen Angels were brilliantly photographed because there it was more appropriate to use dynamic cinematography (more temperament).  It's only Kar-Wai's second film but still his most solid and memorable and maybe even more internationally appealing than 'In the mood for love', without making compromises or getting sentimental.  I just can't think of anything that is not good in 'Days of being wild'.10 points out of 10 :-)rogierrAug 6, 2001PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ19How long is Days of Being Wild?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateDecember 15, 1990 (Hong Kong)Country of originHong KongOfficial siteOfficial SiteLanguagesCantoneseShanghaineseTagalogEnglishMandarinAlso known asThe True Story of a HoodlumFilming locationsPhilippinesProduction companyIn-Gear FilmSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross US & Canada$146,310Opening weekend US & Canada$18,090Nov 21, 2004Gross worldwide$3,255,660See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 35 minutesColorColorAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Days of Being Wild (1990) officially released in Canada in French?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
