Welcome to Brian MacDonald Rare Rugs & Carpets
WINTER SALE NOW ON. See a selection of rugs and weavings with big discounts in 'Antique Categories' and scroll down to 'A Winter Sale'.These wonderful pieces demonstrate the consummate skill of the weavers of the 18th and 19th centuries, who produced beautiful works of art in primitive living conditions and hostile landscapes. The weavings show the rich colour palette of natural dyes, which have mellowed for over 100 years. The spontaneity of design and freedom of expression of the weaver makes each one of these rugs, carpets and tribal bags, a woven work of art.The 3rd edition of my book 'Tribal Rugs - Treasures of the Black Tent' is becoming scarce but I still have copies available at the price of £50 plus postage.
