I possess a great ability to do character voices and impressions from celebrity or the political world, accents, to whacky characters from all over the globe.
I have done commercial voice over work, song parodies, character impression drops, web video hosting and so much more.
I will fearlessly attempt any voice or impressions.
I can also do straight narration or announcer reads.
I also do live play by play for a professional wrestling company called Maximum Pro Wrestling(Canada).
Aside from my 9+ years on a morning show in Toronto, I have done improv classes, I run a wrestling promotion in which I am the primary voice of.With that company, I lead on all production and direction of video and audio content. I am comfortable behind a mic and in front of a camera.
I have a simple yet reliable studio set up in my home in which I am able to record and edit voice overs. I also have full and quick access to professional production studios at anytime if my set up does not suit the needs of the client.
I am very flexible and easy to work with. I love a challenge and am confident in my abilities to meet expectations.
I'm not happy until the client is happy.
