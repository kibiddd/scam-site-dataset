Wicked Signs Alektra Blue, Mikayla Mendez

LOS ANGELES — Wicked Pictures has added two new contract performers to its lineup: Alektra Blue and Mikayla Mendez.
Blue joins Wicked with more than 140 titles on her resume, including “Fallen” and “Predator 2” for Wicked. Blue also was a Penthouse Pet in the April 2008 issue.
"My goal is to become a great actress, and there's no better place to accomplish that than Wicked,” she said. “I love the challenge of pushing myself as a performer. I've been a fan of Wicked from the beginning, and I always admired their movies. I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity, and there's no other company I'd want to commit to on this level."
Mendez joins Wicked with almost 100 titles to her name, including the recent Wicked production “Bad Girls.” Mendez has been in the industry for about three years, performing under a few different names, including her most recent handle, "Mikayla."
Mendez praised Wicked’s high production values.
"I've worked on several Wicked movies in the past, and I've realized this is definitely where I want to be," said Mendez, who is also Wicked’s first Latina contract performer. "Their approach to condom use has always been appealing to me, as has the professionalism of their sets. Every time I freelanced for Wicked in the past, I could see that I was growing as an actress and a performer. I can't wait to see what the future holds."
Wicked Pictures owner and president Steve Orenstein predicted big things for his two new stars.
"Alektra and Mikayla are stylish, unique individuals,” he said. “These are girls who've consistently impressed us with everything they've done, from their performances to how they conduct business and the way they relate to their fans.”
