Athletics Managers  | Bold = HOF | Research by Baseball Almanac
The Kansas City Athletics never finished higher than sixth position and in 1968 became the modern day Oakland Athletics (Oakland Athletics Managers). Was the team given a fair chance? Should they have stayed in Kansas City, or was it a good time for them to move on? Share your opinion us on our Baseball Almanac Facebook Group, on Baseball Almanac Twitter, via Baseball Almanac Messenger, or our baseball forum — Baseball Fever..
During the 1955 season the Kansas City Athletics, who had a sixty-three & ninety-one record, had their largest attendance when 1,393,054 fans attended home games.
On April 12, 1955, the Kansas City Athletics set a new team record when 32,147 fans attend an Opening Day game.
Where what happened yesterday is being preserved today.
