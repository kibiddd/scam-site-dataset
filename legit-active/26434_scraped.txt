One of the most profoundly influential artists of the 19th century, Vincent Van Gogh (1853 – 1890), was a Dutch post-Impressionist Master whose innovative artwork powerfully influenced modern Expressionism, Fauvism, and early Abstraction. Astoundingly prolific, Van Gogh produced all of his work in 10 years, at one point, creating 150 paintings and drawings within one year.
Some of van Gogh's most well-known paintings include this print of "The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, Arles, at Night, c. 1888,"  and his self-portrait "Self Portrait with Grey Hat."
