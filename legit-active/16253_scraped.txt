Our founders, Paul Fleming and Brian Bennett, uphold industry-leading sourcing standards. The ingredients in our dishes come from suppliers that share our relentless focus on quality. Whether it’s a perfectly seasoned ribeye seared on our mesquite grill or the produce that fills our salad bowls, you’ll savor the quality that our thoughtfully sourced foods bring to every dish.
Our mission begins with our sourcing practices, but it hardly ends there. We uplift the dining experience with remarkable hospitality in a polished, contemporary atmosphere designed to invite and excite in equal measure. Join us today to relax, unwind, and discover how America’s food revolution is unfolding at our tables.

CloseCloseUncompromising Quality StandardsThe best quality just tastes better.— Brian Bennett, Co-FounderFrom our premium beef to our local artisan bakeries, our higher-standard ingredients result in better tasting dishes that you can feel good about eating. That’s why every dish we serve at Paul Martin’s is made from ingredients we trust. It’s a healthier and better way to eat, and that is something we never compromise.  CloseCloseMesquite Grilling Over a Live FireOur live-fire grill is the heart of our kitchen.— Paul Fleming, Co-FounderCooking over a live fire requires constant attention and a deft touch. At Paul Martin’s, mesquite coals bring a uniquely delicious, smoky flavor to every piece of meat we cook, while ensuring that every cut is perfectly seared on the outside and tender and juicy in the middle. It’s hard to resist the warmth and comfort of a live fire, especially when it’s grilling a perfectly marinated skirt steak. CloseCloseHouse-Made & Hand-Crafted FoodsWe make things from scratch so we can see everything that goes into our food.— Paul Fleming, Co-FounderEvery day we butcher our meat in house, whisk up our bases, sauces, and salad dressings from scratch, and flip hand-pressed tortillas on the grill. It takes extra time, but the best food isn’t prepared using shortcuts. Whether it’s marinating our own olives or pickling our own onions, we believe every extra touch can be tasted. When you cook with your hands, you serve a work of love. CloseCloseBuilding PartnershipsIt’s all about knowing who and where your food comes from.— Brian Bennett, Co-FounderThe partnerships Paul Fleming and Brian Bennett have with our purveyors are built upon mutual trust and integrity. Never-Settle Sourcing means we’ll never let distance, price, or convenience be a barrier to finding the best quality ingredients. At Paul Martin’s, we continuously search for the most humane ranchers, the most thoughtful farmers, and the most innovative winemakers to partner with. It’s our passion. CloseCloseRemarkable HospitalityWe want to foster an experience where every guest and employee recognizes how much they matter to us.— Brad Kaemmer, CEOAt Paul Martin’s, we will never be satisfied pairing an ordinary experience with our extraordinary food. From the host that welcomes you, to the knowledgeable servers that guide you through our extensive wine list, to the kitchen staff that ensure your order is prepared exactly as requested, we know that people matter. They are as central to your meal as the ingredients we so carefully source. Our goal is that your time spent with us is nothing short of remarkable. CloseCloseMaking Dining an EventIt’s how you make people feel that matters most.— Brad Kaemmer, CEOWe think the perfect meal starts with an appetizer made to share. Our dining room invites date nights, business meetings, or casual evenings out in a polished yet welcoming and convivial atmosphere. Pull up a seat in our expansive bar, order your favorite merlot, and you’ll discover a lively, communal energy. At Paul Martin’s, we know timeless food, great wine, and good company put a feeling of happiness and celebration into every occasion.

Featured Menu ItemsBeefChickenSeafoodSweetsBLACKENED RIBEYEWITHcreamyMASHED POTATOESWe start with 14 ounces of Certified Angus Beef® — beef that meets 10 specific standards of quality. It’s house-cut and sprinkled with Prodhommés blackening seasoning before it hits our live-fire grill for a smoky, nuanced flavor. Our classic creamy mashed potatoes finish the plate. Try it with a glass of Silver Oak Alexander Valley Cabernet.
View MenuSPICY CHICKEN SANDWICHWITHseasonedFRENCH FRIESThe perfect way to elevate your lunch, this chicken breast is hand breaded and fried for a golden crispy crust. We then smother it in our signature spicy sauce. It’s stacked on a brioche bun slathered in our chili aioli and topped with arugula, pickles and pickled onions as a perfect foil to the heat. Try it with one our local draft beers.
View MenuSTEELHEAD EN CASSOULETTEWITHcreamyBEURRE BLANCA Seafood Watch “Best Choice,” our steelhead salmon is sustainably farmed in the waters of their indigenous habitat, the Columbia River, WA. In this twist on a French classic, we cook it alongside asparagus, roasted peppers, and cherry tomatoes in a ceramic cassoulet dish to concentrate the flavors. To finish, it’s served with a beurre blanc for drizzling.
View MenuWARM BUTTER CAKEWITHvanilla ice cream& FRESH BERRIESUnless you hail from St. Louis, you may have never had Butter Cake or even heard of it, but take the word of our guests, it’s not to be missed! Baked to order in a miniature cast iron skillet, it features a crisp outer crust and an ooey, gooey interior that can only be described as heavenly. We serve it à la mode for an enticing contrast of warm and cool.
