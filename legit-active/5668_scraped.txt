In the second round of the Open Championship, the veteran golfer took his 4-iron at the par-3 sixth hole, struck the ball with a beautiful swing and watched it take one bounce before falling into the cup for a hole in one. Watson lifted his arms in celebration and let out a smile as the crowd cheered on. "Wish I could have seen it go in," the five-time British Open champ joked as he went to grab his ball. The incredible shot came just one day after Dustin Johnson aced the par-3 16th hole at Royal St. George's in the first round. Advertisement
