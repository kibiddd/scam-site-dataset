It's an aBIZmal new show. It is HORRIBLE in my mind! I'll tell you why.The actors are all given damn gutter dialogue! They all try hard with the scripts they've been given, but they can't pull it off, man! First there's the dad, Dave Keller, the real family knucklehead. He's so stupid in his role, because you can't ever tell if the fool is serious or just making a bad joke. Then the son, Eli, who always tries to look cool but just ends up looking like an idiot, again like he always does. Then the horrible older daughter, Avalon, who begs to be popular, but sadly, she isn't. Then the younger daughter, Ronnie, who almost always outwits her dumb siblings. Then the mom, Anna, who's the BEST actor in the show. She can't really act either, but she does a better job than the rest of the cast!I watched about 2 or 3 episodes, and that's all I'm ever going to watch of this rubbish. I'd rather go to jail than watch another episode of Family Biz, even one. This is an abysmal show. Please, never watch this!TorontoLiverApr 7, 2010PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateMarch 6, 2009 (Canada)Country of originCanadaLanguageEnglishAlso known asDad's in the AtticFilming locationsOttawa, Ontario, CanadaProduction companiesBreakout FilmsExpand DramaMuse Entertainment EnterprisesSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Family Biz (2009) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
