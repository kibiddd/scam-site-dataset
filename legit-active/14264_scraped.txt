Billy Joel - The Bridge Lyrics
Artist: Billy Joel
Album: Miscellaneous
Genre: Rock
Heyo! SONGLYRICS just got interactive. Highlight. Review: RIFF-it.  RIFF-it good.
Listen while you read!
I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break
Some things unknown are best left alone foreverAnd if a vow is what it takes
Haven't you paid for your mistakesAfter the moment passes
And the impulse disappearsYou can still hold back
Because you don't crack very easilyIt's a time-honored resolution
Because the danger is always nearIt's with you now
But that ain't how it was supposed to be
And it's hard to believe after all these years
It still gives you pain and it still brings tearsAnd you feel like a fool
'Cause in spite of the rulesYou've got a memoryChorus
