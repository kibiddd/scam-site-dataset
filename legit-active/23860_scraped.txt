Ub Iwerks
Ubbe Eert "Ub" Iwerks, A.S.C. (/ˈʌb ˈaɪwɜːrks/; March 24, 1901 – July 7, 1971) was an American animator, cartoonist, character designer, inventor, and special effects technician, who created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Mickey Mouse with Walt Disney. The works Iwerks produced alongside Disney went on to win numerous awards, including multiple Academy Awards.
He was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His father, Eert Ubbe Iwerks, emigrated to the U.S. in 1869 from the village of Uttum in East Frisia (northwest Germany, today part of the municipality of Krummhörn). Ub's full name can be seen on early "Alice" shorts that he signed. Several years later he simplified his name to "Ub Iwerks", sometimes written as "U. B. Iwerks".
He is the father of Disney Legend Don Iwerks and grandfather to documentary film producer Leslie Iwerks.
Career
Iwerks was considered by many to be Walt Disney's oldest friend, and spent most of his career with Disney. The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio in Kansas City, and would eventually start their own commercial art business together. Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company (which would later be named The Kansas City Film Ad Company). While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Disney decided to take up work in animation, and Iwerks soon joined him.

The Real-Life Drama Behind the Birth of Mickey Mouse (feat. Tony Hale) - Drunk History
Ub Iwerks was Walt Disney’s animation partner, and happened to design a little character by the name of Mickey Mouse.
About Drunk History:
Based on the popular web series, Drunk History is the liquored-up narration of our nation's history. Host Derek Waters, along with an ever-changing cast of actors and comedians, travels across the country to present the rich tales that every city in this land has to offer. Booze helps bring out the truth. It's just that sometimes the truth is a little incoherent.

Ub Iwerks Animation
Ubbe Eert 'Ub' Iwerks (1901-1971)  was an American animator, cartoonist, character designer, inventor, and special effects technician who is best known for working with Walt Disney during the 20's and forming his own studio during the 30's.
Iwerks' animation is masterfully crafted due to the soliloquy of the drawings and the movements of the characters are very mechanical, and yet inventive. He also does some of the most bizarre camera perspectives (i.e. Plane Crazy).
Special Thanks to Mark Kausler, Devon Baxter and Hans Perk for some of the Identifications of Ub Iwerks.

Mickey Mouse - Steamboat Willie (1928)
Steamboat Willie - November 18, 1928
Directed by Walt Disney & Ub Iwerks
Embora Steamboat Willie tenha sido o primeiro desenho animado da formação do Mickey a ser lançado, dois desenhos animados Plane Crazy e The Gallopin' Gaucho foram produzidos antes, mas lançados após este desenho animado.
O título é uma paródia do filme de Buster Keaton, Steamboat Bill, Jr., também lançado em 1928.

Embora Steamboat Willie tenha sido o primeiro desenho animado da formação do Mickey a ser lançado, dois desenhos animados Plane Crazy e The Gallopin' Gaucho foram produzidos antes, mas lançados após este desenho animado.
O título é uma paródia do filme de Buster Keaton, Steamboat Bill, Jr., também lançado em 1928.

You may not know his name, but you definitely know his work. Meet Ub Iwerks, the man behind the creation of Mickey Mouse and one of the pioneers of the animation industry.
Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks met in Kansas City and worked together throughout the years to make their make on the world of animations through many ventures together, however only one of them ever gets the credit.  From drawing every early Mickey Mouse cartoon, including Steamboat Willie to making technical innovations like they were nothing, Ub Iwerks deserves to have his story told.

Ub Iwerks was Walt Disney’s animation partner, and happened to design a little character by the name of Mickey Mouse.
About Drunk History:
Based on the popular web series, Drunk History is the liquored-up narration of our nation's history. Host Derek Waters, along with an ever-changing cast of actors and comedians, travels across the country to present the rich tales that every city in this land has to offer. Booze helps bring out the truth. It's just that sometimes the truth is a little incoherent.

Ubbe Eert 'Ub' Iwerks (1901-1971)  was an American animator, cartoonist, character designer, inventor, and special effects technician who is best known for working with Walt Disney during the 20's and forming his own studio during the 30's.
Iwerks' animation is masterfully crafted due to the soliloquy of the drawings and the movements of the characters are very mechanical, and yet inventive. He also does some of the most bizarre camera perspectives (i.e. Plane Crazy).
Special Thanks to Mark Kausler, Devon Baxter and Hans Perk for some of the Identifications of Ub Iwerks.

Ub Iwerks
Ubbe Eert "Ub" Iwerks, A.S.C. (/ˈʌb ˈaɪwɜːrks/; March 24, 1901 – July 7, 1971) was an American animator, cartoonist, character designer, inventor, and special effects technician, who created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Mickey Mouse with Walt Disney. The works Iwerks produced alongside Disney went on to win numerous awards, including multiple Academy Awards.
He was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His father, Eert Ubbe Iwerks, emigrated to the U.S. in 1869 from the village of Uttum in East Frisia (northwest Germany, today part of the municipality of Krummhörn). Ub's full name can be seen on early "Alice" shorts that he signed. Several years later he simplified his name to "Ub Iwerks", sometimes written as "U. B. Iwerks".
He is the father of Disney Legend Don Iwerks and grandfather to documentary film producer Leslie Iwerks.
Career
Iwerks was considered by many to be Walt Disney's oldest friend, and spent most of his career with Disney. The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio in Kansas City, and would eventually start their own commercial art business together. Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company (which would later be named The Kansas City Film Ad Company). While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Disney decided to take up work in animation, and Iwerks soon joined him.
