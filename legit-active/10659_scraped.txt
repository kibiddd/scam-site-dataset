I was expecting it do be dirty because it was only 65$ for a great location. I weight about 100lbs and I was scared to stay there overnight with a friend. Not a tight security place, shady crowd hanging around. If you're on a budget its a bed to sleep on, but I wouldn't recommend it for single women who aren't traveling with a man or a group. Luckily the owner was very understanding & helpful!Read moreDate of stay: May 20133.0 of 5 bubblesValue5.0 of 5 bubblesLocation2.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness4.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with friendsRoom Tip: Choose one with a private bathroom so you don't have to leave the room in the middle of the...See more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Very inexpensive stay and spacious. The owner was very nice and attentive to the loud neighbors during our stay. The place is old and smoke travels from other rooms. It was a place for us to rest our heads. Location was great and free parking. Do not stay here if you need super cleanliness and hate smoke.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015Trip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

If you are not fussy and simply want a cheap place with a great location to sleep for a few hours and a quick shower, then this is it. Don't expect the usual from other hotels and I am not sure If I would even call this place as such. There is no reception desk per se, very casual and informal check-in, and don't expect your bed made up for you daily nor daily changed towels or linens. The decor and bed covers are funky / retro / old.  But I enjoyed my stay and would go back - not sure about the girlfriend though as she was not overly impressed but didn't mind. The negative reviews weren't wrong, it's just depends on what a person can put up with. We rented a suite. The place is old and as such has a dirty feel / appearance but it wasn't that bad at all. I was expecting worse given some of the reviews. The room had a staleness to it so we bought an air freshner. The bathroom and kitchenette are quite tiny but again, we had no qualms about it as we had hot running water. Bring your own shampoo, conditioner and soap and hair dryer. We didn't use the kitchen but made use of the fridge for storing cold drinks. The A/C was working but it wasn't very hot so a couple of open windows was fine. The wi-fi was nice to have and we didn't have any connectivity issues. Yes, there were some shady characters at the hotel and it was loud late one night with shouting but we never felt we were in danger or anything. You can hear guests coming up and down the creaky stairs.I would NOT recommend this hotel for FAMILIES or business travelers use to a typical hotel. However, this place is GREAT for its location and price and would recommend for budget travelers / backpackers. Again, you can't be too fussy a person and don't go expecting a usual hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 20143.0 of 5 bubblesValue3.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness3.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We had the luck of being given the room right next to the so-called manager's office... when we came back to our hotel that night, this 'manager' was visibly drunk (carrying around a half-empty bottle of alcohol in his hand) and yelling/threatening other guests. In addition to this, he also let himself into our room without our permission (from the balcony?! – how is that even possible & isn't that incredibly scary?!) and then continued banging on our door to be let in after we kicked him out. We ended up leaving the hotel at around 4am because we felt incredibly unsafe... Given the situation & what happened, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anyone, but especially young/solo travellers (women in particular!!). & This is coming from a 20-year old who's travelled solo all across Europe (including hitchhiking!) – I don't think I've ever felt as unsafe as I did that night!Read moreDate of stay: August 20141.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesService1.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with friendsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This is a warning for all travellers but ESPECIALLY young women - STAY AWAY from this place.  The "manager" or whatever he likes to call himself should be arrested. He continued to let himself into our room without our permission while we were getting ready to go out and again when we were ready to go to bed and changing out of our clothes. The second time he let himself in, he was obviously incredibly drunk and holding a half-drunk bottle of alcohol. He continued to scream at other tenants, even threatening to shoot them. We also have a feeling that he used our room while we were out, due to the fact we found an article of clothing which belonged to him - buried in our beds... which he came back to retrieve later on?? It was DEFINITELY not there before. I've never been so creeped out in my life.I have no idea how this "hotel" even exists. My friends and I have never felt so unsafe in any of our other travels. It got to the point where we had to barricade our door with chairs, quickly pack our stuff, and leave.Have you ever tried to book a hotel in downtown Montreal at 4am on a Saturday night? It's near impossible. The only option was to take a $40 taxi ride to a proper hotel all the way by the airport.. for $160 a night. We ended up spending 10X more than what we could afford and it completely ruined our weekend in Montreal.Please, stay anywhere else but here.Read moreDate of stay: July 20141.0 of 5 bubblesValue1.0 of 5 bubblesRooms1.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with friendsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Those were the positives (afterall, I am a positive person).If you had to do a parody of a bad hotel experience (from every possible perspective), this place would fit the bill , and then some!The other reviewers have identified the issues, they are all true.I had the privilege of enduring a midnight screaming match between persons unknown!My special take was the furnishings: looked like someone went on a shopping spree at The Goodwill/Salvation Army Store/Value Village; my favourite was a glass that was from a Texaco giveaway in the early 70's - priceless!anyway - move on to the next listing !!Read moreDate of stay: October 20145.0 of 5 bubblesLocation1.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled soloThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Do not say I did not warn you! I read a few less than demeaning reviews and I did not take them seriously. After all I thought it was in Montreal and could not be that bad. It is worst than the worst reviews you will read. It is a shame for a city like Montreal to entertain such madness. I booked this hotel for tonight and the weekend but here I am, writing this review in a different hotel outside of Montreal. I was at the place (I will never call it a hotel because it can never be called a hotel even in the poorest of countries) and what I witnessed was beyond description. The entrance was not only smelly but it has all around it a sense of people doing drugs. And wow, when I met the so-called owner or receptionist or whatever he calls himself looking unkempt, I had to run from the place. I only asked him where the reception was (which by the way does not exist) and he starting talking as if he was under the influence of drugs plus alcohol. Tell me about being rude; that was not rude, it was madness. What's more... anybody who comes out of that place looks wretched and some came out to threaten me to leave the neighborhood. If you think I am overreacting, go see for yourself but on second thought, make sure you have either a security or the police with you. In brief, the tourist board of Montreal should be ashamed for licencing a place like this. And I will warn expedia, hotel.com, booking.com to be very careful in recommending certain places to clients. Somehow I am blaming expedia for this disaster and I am calling them first thing tomorrow, so they should be prepared... I cannot rate this property because there is no negative rating, which should not be the case if properties like this are allowed to exist in no small place but Montreal.Read moreDate of stay: July 20141.0 of 5 bubblesValue1.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness1.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It's not. It's a rooming house. You walk into a narrow corridor and make your way to the back where the owner has her office. We picked up our keys and walked up two creaky floors to our "suite". Yes it has a bathroom, Yes it has a kitchen. Yes it has a separate bedroom. But everything is fairly worn out. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, we paid $79 a night for four of us staying in downtown Montreal. You cannot get a better deal, it's as simple as that. On the plus side:1. The owner is terrific. She stayed up late (11:30pm) to give us our keys. She was almost always there, cheerful, and helpful. For me, this place gets major points for her personal presence.2. The room was blazing hot (-5F outside) so we actually had to turn down the thermostat and crack a window.3. Free, good wi-fi4. Free parking ($20-30 per night at any other nearby hotel)5. Beds were reasonably comfortable.6. Bathroom was functional. Good water pressure, plenty of hot water, and plenty of towels when asked for.7. We did not use the kitchen but there is a full size fridge, a couple of burners and a functional sink if you needed to store something or make a meal.8. It was quiet. We were on the back of the building (Room #8), looking out onto an alley. We rarely heard people in the hallway. This may be different though if you are on the lower floors.9. It was clean.So, if you are thinking you are staying in a hotel, you will give this place a poor rating. If you embrace it for what it is, an incredible value in the middle of an amazing city, you'll be pleased.Read moreDate of stay: February 20125.0 of 5 bubblesValue3.0 of 5 bubblesRooms5.0 of 5 bubblesLocation4.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness5.0 of 5 bubblesService3.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with friendsRoom Tip: If you can handle the steps, the higher floors night be better due to creaky stairs and hallways.See more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My daughter and I booked a week here this summer; left several days early when we realized they were selling drugs out of there.   Even had a 'bust' by police, but the 'suspects' returned back within hours.   Witnessed what appeared to be people 'shooting up' in the alley where we parked behind the building.   Lots and lots of 'traffic'... people coming and going thru the halls, stairs, etc.   The old man that cleaned tried his best, but the place was ... filthy... to say the least.   Disgusting.   Unsafe.
