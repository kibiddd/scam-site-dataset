Short films such as In Old California (1910) had previously been made in the neighborhood.GoofsEarly in the film, when Captain James Wynnegate (played by Dustin Farnum) is on board the sailing ship, he writes a note asking that a "check" enclosed with the note be cashed for him. Since Captain Farnum is an Englishman, he would have spelled the word as "cheque", the standard British spelling. (Moreover, the handwriting in the note is scarcely that of an educated British military officer: the lines of writing are crooked and the letters are crudely formed.)QuotesLady Diana: Jim, I want you to go away for my sake!Alternate versionsA seemingly unrestored print aired 5 April 2004 on Turner Classic Movies with a new orchestral score by H. Scott Salinas.ConnectionsFeatured in The House That Shadows Built (1931)User reviews11ReviewFeatured review6/10Dull, Dated, Bleak, but Nonetheless a Must-See Western!A western with dull if bleak scenery and costumes that look mighty strange (though doubtless the real items), this is an interesting example of early film-making, but one that will delight mainly critics and historians rather than the general movie fan.The dated, old-hat story is a little difficult to follow at first because the two cousins, James and Henry, are understandably lookalikes, and neither actor has the skills to differentiate himself. In fact, it's hard to believe that stolid Dustin Farnum had a big stage reputation as he displays little charisma or ability here. However, he doubtless improved because he made another forty movies before retiring in 1926. (He married his leading lady here, Winifred Kingston, in 1924).The rest of the players run rings around Farnum in "The Squaw Man". Red Wing is reasonably effective as the real heroine of the piece, but it's personable Dick LaReno, here making his first of 81 movies, who really impresses as our hero's foremannot the sheriff who is played by either Dick Palace or W.H. Stratton. And I think that's Art Acord playing the deputy. It's hard to tell because there are no close-ups. Each scene is filmed with either a static long shot or medium group shot. And there is virtually no camera movement apart from a few slight pans.JohnHowardReidApr 21, 2008PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ17How long is The Squaw Man?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 15, 1914 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesNoneEnglishAlso known asThe White ManFilming locationsHollywood, Los Angeles, California, USAProduction companyJesse L.
