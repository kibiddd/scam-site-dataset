I was in a wine store the other day, talking about unoaked Chablis, when a gentleman suggested that I give this wine a try. Turns out he is the importer, and he advised that this is unoaked and traditionally made. Worth a shot, and I'm glad I tried it. Intriguing upon uncorking, showing quince and white grapefruit, reminiscent of the '07 Goisot Fié Gris Saint-Bris Corps de Garde that I went through over the past couple of years, and that wine is 100% Fié Gris, which I understand is related to Sauvignon Blanc, and this 07 Maison Blanche is, come to think of it, more reminiscent of citrusy Sauv Blanc than Chablis. It seems like this wine wants to show some sweetness, like a Riesling, and yet it's bone dry. Huge minerality on the finish, where its Chablis-ness really becomes apparent. Riesling-like acidity, clear fruit, clear mid palate, great acidity and minerality, but just a touch hollow and seems like it could use more of a middle. Drink now. Perhaps the Premier Cru wines from Maison Blanche have that depth and midpalate that this wine lacks; I'm curious enough to try them. Enjoyed over three nights, no degradation and the acidity and mineral finish becoming clearer each night.
