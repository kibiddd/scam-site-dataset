We booked through Cornish Gems with whom we had good communication both before and during our stay.  We received a welcome pack of a cream tea and a bottle of Prosecco which was a nice touchHaving stayed in the area previously in a hotel we were glad we switched to self-catering.  The kitchen/diner/living space was both well-equipped and spacious.  The 2 bedrooms were a little smaller but the choice of furniture did not help that.  You get a lovely view over the bay which was a delight to wake up to.  The train station is a few minutes’ walk away down a steep hill and trains to St Ives leave every 30 mins - £2 return for adultsEach flat is allocated one parking space but there is a long stay car park 2 minutes away which charges just over £4 for 24 hours if , like us, you have 2 cars.The downside were the Covid rules which meant you couldn’t check in until 6pm and had to be out by 9am on the day of departure.  This was a real pain as you have to strip the beds and put the linen in one back, put the sheets in another as well as empty the bins – no time just to sit and enjoy your last breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: October 20214.0 of 5 bubblesValue4.0 of 5 bubblesRooms5.0 of 5 bubblesServiceThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The views were amazing from the sitting room across Carbis bay. The apartment is ideally situated , few minutes walk to the railway station for the train into St Ives . One day we travelled by train to Penzance , changing at St Erth.The lovely welcome gifts very appreciated and a nice treat. The coastal walk into St Ives is lovely, join just in front of Carbis Bay hotel.We hope to be be back one day. Will definitely be recommending this accommodation  to our friends.

The apartment is of a high standard, spotlessly clean with gorgeous furniture - just like home from home. The staff are helpful and make it even more special by arranging pink bubbly, fresh scones and fresh lillies upon your arrival. We are picky but could not fault this place in any way. It's in a truly beautiful setting with Carbis Bay beach just a 5 min walk away, and St Ives either a 20 min walk or 5 min drive or train journey - suggest getting the train (as parking tricky in st ives). It's a lovely ride but be aware the trains only run 1 per hour (there and back) and stop at 8pm ish. Feel slightly reluctant as i write, as don't want to lose our chance of booking this again and again due to it being full!

An ideal holiday destination.We have now stayed at Hawke's Point twice; last year in Penthouse 24 and this year in Penthouse 25.  Both have been fantastic - immaculate, really luxurious and with everything you could possibly want for a relaxing holiday.  We really cannot fault it - the location is brilliant; walking distance from the beach and a short walk from the train station which takes you to St Ives in just 3 minutes.  There are restaurants and a shop within walking distance too - we had takeaway pizzas from La Casita and they were fantastic.  The beach is the nicest we have ever been to, either in the UK or abroad.The apartment itself has everything you might need.  The beds are comfortable, the apartments are quiet and this year our toddler son absolutely loved having Apple TV in the apartment as it meant he could request Fireman Sam via iTunes on repeat most days!  (Incidentally the wifi is super fast so downloading was incredibly quick).There is not much I can add which has not already been said in other reviews but I would just echo all the positive comments and say that we will continue to come to Hawke's Point as it really is ideal for a family with small children, but we also would have loved it if we'd visited pre-children.Read moreDate of stay: July 20155.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness5.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyRoom Tip: The penthouses are very spacious.

The beds were comfy, lots of space and very clean. On arrival we had some lovely scones and jam. The flowers were beautiful too!The only feedback I have is that someone had taken our car park space, so every time we came in and out we had to look for a space. This of course would then have a knock on effect on others. I think the option shouldn't be allowed. Everyone should park in their spot.The weather was fantastic all week and the view from the apartment was great. We will be coming back to stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The standard of accomodation is excellent - it is immaculate from the bed linen to the fluffy towels and bath robes.  We were also impressed with all of the utilities and  how well equipped the apartment was.  The view from our balcony looking towards St Ives was beautiful and whatching the sun setting was awe inspiring.  We were welcomed with an array of cornish goodies and beautiful flowers.  We had a perfect week and have booked to return next year.Janice & Stephen King - Newark; Nottinghamshire.Read moreDate of stay: July 20145.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesService5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On the surface this is a very luxurious place, however it was a little worn down when we stayed...  The fittings are all luxurious and the beds comfy. The ensuite bathroom smelt pretty funny - I had to keep putting bleach down it to try and cover the smell as it would spread into the bedroom. The carpet in the lounge area was dirty when we arrived (I realise this would happen easily on cream carpets, but still, for the price of the stay I would expect more...) There was no coffee for the nespresso machine and the jar of nondescript coffee granules looked, smelled and tasted like they had been there for about three years!  The telescope was also broken, so no views for us!I'm not sure if these things were just because we stayed out of season? At any rate, beside the listed issues the location was great, the views fantastic and the complementary sparkling wine and scones a lovely treat on our arrival.  It's just a shame about those few problems, as I had expected more from the reviews that I have read. Still, a nice place.Read moreDate of stay: November 20124.0 of 5 bubblesValue4.0 of 5 bubblesRooms5.0 of 5 bubblesLocation3.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with friendsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

From the wonderfully warm and informative welcome from Sam to the enjoyment of the luxurious amenities within the apartment - this accommodation and the team behind it is faultless.  Everything in the apartment is of a truly high spec, you are also greeted with a much appreciated welcome pack (milk, shortbreads, butter, ice cream, apple juice), a touch of luxury with bath robes for all, whilst the views across the garden to the St Ives headland are amazing (Sea Garden 6).  Superb location, just a short stroll down the (steep) hill to the beach - we enjoyed a fabulous lunch in the Carbis Bay Beach Hotel spa café on the beach whilst we awaited our check in, a very relaxing & perfect  start to a great weekend after a rather long drive (thanks Sam for the recommendation!).  After parking the car in the secure car park at the apartment, we didn't need to use it again as the train station is just a very short walk down the hill and the train to St Ives is a brilliant service which takes just three minutes to reach the town. This means you can explore the town and relax in any of it's many eateries, until the late evening as the train runs until gone 10pm ish on most nights (apart from Sunday). The weather during our stay (31 Oct to 3 Nov) was perfect (freakishly warm for the time of year) and we enjoyed a very pleasant walk along the coastal path to St Ives where we saw more stunning views of the beaches along the way - it probably took no longer than 20 mins, if that.  It's a great feeling to travel such a long way ( 6 hr drive) and then have the reassurance that you will enjoy pure luxury from your accommodation once you arrive.  We have found a 'gem' and can confidently say we will return - I would love to see this place in the Summer.  We will be highly recommending to all friends and family.Read moreDate of stay: November 20145.0 of 5 bubblesRooms5.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness5.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Sorry about the delay, we have only just come across the questions app on the Trip Advisor platform.
Yes there each apartment has a reserved parking space in our private car park which is adjacent to the properties at Hawkes Point.
