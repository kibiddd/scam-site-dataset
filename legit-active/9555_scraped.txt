Unfortunately it was on Mother's Day, which proved to be very busy.  We ate outside in the patio to avoid the wait.  They have not lost their mojo.  Service was prompt and the meals were tasty, albeit a little dry,   Love the large servings of ice water and lemonade.  Beef and pork ribs were quite good and ample.  Sides are always great.  No room for dessert!Read moreWritten May 13, 2022 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is good. The ribs are my favorite St.Louis pork ribs or the Beef ribs. They both have a great Smokey flavor and very tender. Lucille’s sides are also tasty. I’m not  a big fan of the jalapeño cornbread. The street corn and loaded mashed potatoes are my two favorites.  Their lemonades, sweet tea, or a back porch strawberry lemonade will do the trick for whatever you’re pleasure. It’s a great place for any group small or large. Located in Henderson, NV. Green Valley Ranch.Read moreWritten March 27, 2022 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were not an easy crowd to manage and he busted his you-know-what to keep us happy. I had the brisket sandwich and it was lean and delicious. My husband had ribs and enjoyed his meal. Can’t speak for the other 18, but it looked like they enjoyed themselves. Lucille’s was generous enough to let us bring a birthday cake and provided plates and utensils. They also allowed us to do multiple checks and use discounted gift cards (purchased from Costco).
My only complaint is that it was quite loud in that room. Even though it was semi-private, the acoustics are pretty rough. I realize we WERE the loud group, but that room isn’t conducive to conversation. I felt bad for the other two parties that were in there with us. Overall, we had a great dinner and our birthday girl was happy. And we really appreciate our server and his teammates who were assisting.Read moreWritten January 15, 2022 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They charged $23 for a lunch special of three meats and the portion size was so small (three small ribs, a spoonful of pork and 3 slivers of brisket you could practically see through it was cut so thin). Further, it was an additional $5 for a small side of fries and $4 for one piece of Texas toast (which doesn’t come with the meat platter.)  This Is not super expensive, especially by Vegas standards, but it leaves you feeling cheated. We won’t be back.Read moreWritten February 1, 2025 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The meat was all overcooked, and the vegetables were undercooked.
The menu claimed to offer a "half rack" of beef ribs in a meal for an additional $8 (see photo), but I was given a quarter of a rack (3 bones), which was overcooked and leathery.
You've heard of "fall of the bone"... these required the meat to be vigorously torn from the bones.  They also left the membrane on the back of the ribs, which is just plain lazy.
The chicken was overcooked, and dry... even fully chewed, I had to drink water to get it down.  That said, the "Alabama" sauce on the chicken was quite nice, but flavor can't make up for dry meat.
Even the soda was seriously overpriced @ $4.25 for a glass of Coke.
The server said she would address it, but ran my card without addressing it.
When I spoke calmly to the manager, she did nothing but make excuses, tell me that their definition of a half rack is correct/acceptable, and ask me to leave so she could lock up the restaurant.
Very unfortunate.  Not likely I'll ever be back, and I definitely cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.Read moreWritten January 11, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

To encourage the event in the past, Lucille's included all day happy hour food and beverage specials. This worked well for our family schedule. When we arrived at 11:30 today, there was a totally new team on board. The new manager and server were clueless about all day happy hour, and looked at us like we were out of our minds. Our old bartender was busy handling a large delivery order, and we approached him about the change in policy. He tried to ignore us and acted as if he had no idea of what we were talking about. The restuarant was totally empty, and it would have been to the advantage of the management to simply explain that the policy had changed, and that they would honor the previous special for today only. No such fortune. We left and probably will not return.Read moreWritten October 2, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Previous experiences were excellent. This visit was incredibly disappointing. My BBQ chicken, usually moist and succulent, was totally dried out. Only way to eat it was to dip each piece in BBQ sauce. Wife's BBQ Beef Ribs were way overcooked and barely edible. The food should not have been allowed out of the kitchen.
After paying, we asked for a manager. Had to ask three times - must have taken 15 minutes for someone to come over. She offered to comp us - I said no. My purpose was not to get a free meal. It was to be sure management knew how bad the experience was  and why we will never go back.Read moreWritten June 1, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food quantity and value has gone down over the last couple of years. It is overpriced for what you get. The only reason my rating was not lower is because the service was good. I think other people have figured this out because the restaurant was pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon.Read moreWritten February 10, 2025 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The margarita was $6, but the mix was sweet, not sour at all. The smoke pork was average. I didn't like any of the sauces. I prefer the coleslaw to be  more finely chopped. The best thing they served was the biscuits with the apple butter. That was a 10.Read moreWritten June 9, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Tiny ribs, that’s why they tell you that you get 3-racks, because the are “micro ribs.”  The chicken is the same, small piece and you are supposed to get 4 half chickens.  Must be tiny chickens because the pieces are tiny.  Tiny ribs and tiny chickens, it’s a joke for what I am paying.  If I knew I was getting tiny food I would have just ordered 4 meals and not the “feast.”
Just a word of warning to all of those ordering these expensive feasts, they are not what they are represented to be.Read moreWritten July 4, 2021 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I'm here to tell you that at last nights meal at Lucille's I got one of the worst cases of MSG side effects that I have ever had. Almost a day later I'm still feeling some of the effects like a stiff neck and very out of sorts. The BBQ meats  were totally mediocre to boot. The fresh stramed vegetables, coleslaw  split pea soup tasted really good and clean.  Won't go back again.Read moreWritten May 24, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We got baby back ribs, Beer Can chicken and Brisket with potato salad (Excellent, nice and eggy) and baked beans (very good, alot of bell pepper, if you don't like/know southern food you may not like these).  You get a half chicken, half rack of ribs and about 5 slices of brisket. Everything was excellent good smoke,  good sauce on the ribs, chicken was juicy and the dipping sauce was great. Biscuits were on the dry side but that is what butter and honey are for!

Friends of ours took us here for dinner when we were in town. Good portion sizes. Food was really good. You could smell the BBQ outside so I knew it was good. Best part was the warm towels at the end of the meal to clean your face with.
