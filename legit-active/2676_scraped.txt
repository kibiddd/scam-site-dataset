I was the girl from across the street who babysat with you three darling boys and Boudreau. My heart broke when I heard of Steve's death.  You see, he was my favorite and never failed to be of help to me when I was there keeping you all.  Even the night Boudreau ate the entire tube of Brylcream off of the bathroom counter upstars on Taylorcrest...Steve came to my rescue. Over the years, I have thought of the many hours I kept you guys on Taylorcrest and Olympia and my memories are always warm and funny.  My heart goes out to you all but as a mother...to Ginger most of all!  I am so deeply sorry. I lost my mother just a year ago this coming February 13th and I can tell you that the pain of Steve's death will eventually ease somewhat.  God bless you all.
