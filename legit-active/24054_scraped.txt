Honestly, Mike, the Search button is my suggestion. This is the single most-often asked question on this board, and you'll find a wealth of replies on that question if you do even a very quick search.

The last time I was in Paris CDG (Aug 08)I used the ticket machines for the first time.With a lengthy queue behind me and my newly wedded wife doing a runner, panic started to set in!!! I think i bought a Metro ticket instead of an RER ticket which cost me 3euros for two tickets.I used these tickets to get me from CDG to Convention(17 Addrs).I am not condoning this action but hey i was on honeymoon.

Honestly Mike, whatever you do, don't get caught without the right ticket. The fines are huge.
Do find out which is the closest metro to your hotel and work from that along with all the great advice you have,

"...Some days you eat the bear. Somedays the bear eats you...".
You got lucky and 'ate the bear' this time. Had you been stopped by any of the many itinerant RATP inspector, 'the bear' would've 'eaten you'...to the tune of 50€ (25€ each) on the spot. These inspectors '..take no prisoners..' and accept no, "..I'm sorry. I'm just a dumb tourist who doesn't understand the system.." excuses...nor do they accept VISA, MasterCard or American Express Travelers Cheques.
Toss away your Metro ticket before you leave the gate-controlled spaces of a station and get stopped by a band of these RATP inspectors and the fine is 40€ for not having a valid Ticket or transportation pass...even if you're pockets are bulging with fresh, un-validated Tickets.

Re: Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to paris

The information below was very helpful to me during my first visit to Paris all by myself last December. I was able to take the train and get to my hotel (Hilton - Paris) and back to CDG without any problems.
RER 'B' ligne train from CDG to SAINT MICHEL-NOTRE DAME (36-40 mins)...then quick ligne/train change (pretty much up 'n over) to the RER 'C' ligne train to CHAMP de MARS-TOUR EIFFEL station (10 mins). The exits from the CHAMP de MARS-TOUR EIFFEL station will bring you up to street level, a bit west of Eiffel Tower, near the Bir Haleim bridge, at the intersection of quai Branly / Ave. de la Federation. The rue Jean Rey begins a few meters east (to your right as you face the Seine) along quai Branly. The Hilton is located at the intersection of rue Jean Rey & Ave. de Suffern.
The alternative is to take the RER 'B; ligne, only as far as DARE du NORD...come up to street level and then take the #42-Gare du Nord / Hopital Européen-Georges Pompidou bus route (begins out in front of Gare du Nord) to the stop near the intersection of Ave. Joseph Bouvard & Ave Suffern.
The "..subway.." station that is temporarily closed for renovation is NOT the CHAMP de MARS-TOUR EIFFEL '...RER...' station for the 'C' ligne...but rather the BIR HAKEIM '...METRO..' station for the #6 Metro ligne (which interconnects with Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel) and will NOT effect a RER train transfer from CDG. BUT...it will effect how you use the Metro system once arrived. With the BIR HAKEIM Metro station temporarily out of service, the nearest Metro station to the Hilton will be the DUPLEIX station just a bit farther away......but in practical terms, you may find the La MOTTE PICQUET-GRENELLE station (served by 3 different Metro lignes-- #6, #8 & #10-- the more useful...even if the walking distance is a bit farther from the Hilton).
If you walk a block south (away from the Seine) from the Hilton, to the intersection of Ave. Joseph Bouvard, there will be bus stops for the #42, #69 & #87 bus routes...and if you walk a block north (toward the Seine) stops for the #82 bus route. By any standard, the #42 and #69 bus routes are two of the '..best rides..' in Paris.

"These inspectors '..take no prisoners..' and accept no, "..I'm sorry. I'm just a dumb tourist who doesn't understand the system..""
I got away with that in September. Two of us went through the turnstile together because I could *not* find my ticket, the machine was broken, and the ticket office was closed (it was late evening). I pulled zillions of RER/Metro tickets out of my pockets while protesting my innocence. He glared at me and let me go.
N.B. I won't do it again. I think I was very fortunate.
