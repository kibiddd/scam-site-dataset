Home Improvement (TV series)
Home Improvement is an American television sitcom starring Tim Allen, that aired from September 17, 1991 to May 25, 1999.
The show was created by Matt Williams, Carmen Finestra and David McFadzean.
In the 1990s, it was one of the most watched sitcoms in the American market, winning many awards. The series launched Tim Allen's acting career and also was the start of the television career of Pamela Anderson, who was part of the recurring cast for the first two seasons.
Show background
Based on the stand-up comedy of Tim Allen, Home Improvement made its debut on ABC on September 17, 1991, and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms for almost the entire decade. It went to No.¬†1 in the ratings during the 1993‚Äì1994 season; the same year Allen had the No.¬†1 book (Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man) and movie (The Santa Clause).
Beginning in season two, each episode started with a cold open that used the show's title logo during the teaser. From season 4 to the end of the show's run in 1999, an anthropomorphic version of the logo was used in different types of animation.

Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit!
Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit! is an 2D action platformer video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System very loosely based on the sitcom Home Improvement. A version for the Sega Genesis was reported, but never released.
Plot and gameplay
On a special broadcast of the show Tool Time, Tim prepares to unveil the new Binford ultra power tool line named after him, the Binford-Taylor Turbo Power Tool Line. He goes to retrieve them, only to discover that they are missing and a note left in their place demanding Tim to come.
The player's weapons include modified tools such as a nail gun, a blowtorch (used as a flamethrower), and a chainsaw which hurls energy waves.  These weapons are used to fight dinosaurs, acid-spewing mummies, robot sentries, and other enemies. The game is broken down into four worlds of four levels, each world containing a boss level. The game had no real instruction manual explaining each of the buttons. In its place, a fake manual was used with a sticker reading "Real men don't need instructions" while the splash screen also explained: "Real men don't need instructions."

23 Of Wilson's Best Moments On "Home Improvement"
Fun fact: We never see Wilson's face until the finale.
Welcome to Next of Ken and in this episode, we're counting down 23 Of Wilson's Best Moments On "Home Improvement." Although time has been cruel to the once beloved FOX comedy, one key element remains a favorite among fans and sitcom lovers alike: Wilson. Tim's elusive and secretive neighbor, Wilson, who always hid his face behind a fence, was easily one of the best parts of the show. Wise and honest, Wilson always had the best advice for Tim and his family. Plus, he had some pretty hysterical moments on the show himself. In fact, when Tim would come to him for advice, you never knew what Wilson would be doing behind that dang fence.
What was your favorite Wilson moment? Let us know in the comments below!

Lyrics:
A silhouette waits outside my window
I jump up and I shout to see if you're there
There's nothing but cold sharp air
I wake up, it's another day without you
Finally quit those cigarettes, I got time to spare
It's better when you're not here, yeah
Say you love me, you can lie if it is comforting, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
Please see that I‚Äôve changed, I‚Äôve sealed those cracks in my window panes, and I
I won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
I'm not sick, I'm not weird, I'm simply in love
You must try to understand you were sent from above
Say you hate me well that's just fine, I will wait till the end of time
Say you love me, you can lie if it is comforting, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
Please see that I‚Äôve changed, I‚Äôve sealed those cracks in my window panes, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad today
Loving you is the only thing I ever knew
Letting go is the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
Loving you is the only thing I ever knew
Letting go is the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
(Loving you) it's the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
(Letting go) it's the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
Say you love me, you can lie if it is comforting, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
Please see that I‚Äôve changed, I‚Äôve sealed those cracks in my window panes, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad today
Loving you is the only thing I ever knew
Letting go is the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad today

Lyrics:
A silhouette waits outside my window
I jump up and I shout to see if you're there
There's nothing but cold sharp air
I wake up, it's another day without you
Finally quit those cigarettes, I got time to spare
It's better when you're not here, yeah
Say you love me, you can lie if it is comforting, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
Please see that I‚Äôve changed, I‚Äôve sealed those cracks in my window panes, and I
I won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
I'm not sick, I'm not weird, I'm simply in love
You must try to understand you were sent from above
Say you hate me well that's just fine, I will wait till the end of time
Say you love me, you can lie if it is comforting, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
Please see that I‚Äôve changed, I‚Äôve sealed those cracks in my window panes, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad today
Loving you is the only thing I ever knew
Letting go is the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
Loving you is the only thing I ever knew
Letting go is the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
(Loving you) it's the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
(Letting go) it's the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
Say you love me, you can lie if it is comforting, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad
Please see that I‚Äôve changed, I‚Äôve sealed those cracks in my window panes, and I
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad today
Loving you is the only thing I ever knew
Letting go is the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do
Won't even mind it so bad, won't even find it so sad today

Fun fact: We never see Wilson's face until the finale.
Welcome to Next of Ken and in this episode, we're counting down 23 Of Wilson's Best Moments On "Home Improvement." Although time has been cruel to the once beloved FOX comedy, one key element remains a favorite among fans and sitcom lovers alike: Wilson. Tim's elusive and secretive neighbor, Wilson, who always hid his face behind a fence, was easily one of the best parts of the show. Wise and honest, Wilson always had the best advice for Tim and his family. Plus, he had some pretty hysterical moments on the show himself. In fact, when Tim would come to him for advice, you never knew what Wilson would be doing behind that dang fence.
What was your favorite Wilson moment? Let us know in the comments below!

Home Improvement (TV series)
Home Improvement is an American television sitcom starring Tim Allen, that aired from September 17, 1991 to May 25, 1999.
The show was created by Matt Williams, Carmen Finestra and David McFadzean.
In the 1990s, it was one of the most watched sitcoms in the American market, winning many awards. The series launched Tim Allen's acting career and also was the start of the television career of Pamela Anderson, who was part of the recurring cast for the first two seasons.
Show background
Based on the stand-up comedy of Tim Allen, Home Improvement made its debut on ABC on September 17, 1991, and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms for almost the entire decade. It went to No.¬†1 in the ratings during the 1993‚Äì1994 season; the same year Allen had the No.¬†1 book (Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man) and movie (The Santa Clause).
Beginning in season two, each episode started with a cold open that used the show's title logo during the teaser. From season 4 to the end of the show's run in 1999, an anthropomorphic version of the logo was used in different types of animation.
