New Found Glory - Tangled Up Lyrics
Artist: New Found Glory
Album: Not Without A Fight
Genre: Rock
Heyo! SONGLYRICS just got interactive. Highlight. Review: RIFF-it.  RIFF-it good.
Listen while you read!
Lies, all I hear are lies
Have you ever spoke a word of truth in your life?
Misled, you've always been misled
Always is taking advice from people who claim to be your friends
Oh, I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up, what can I do?
What can I do, what can I, what can I do?
Try, now you need to try
To never make the same mistakes in your life twice
Truth, all I want is truth, turning away
Is the last move I expect from, expect from you
Oh, I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up, what can I do?
Oh, I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up, what can I do, what can I do?
When you set the perfect trap
What can I do? What can I do?
What can I do now?
Lies, all I hear are lies
Oh, I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up, what can I do?
Oh, I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up, what can I do?
What can I do, what can I, what can I do?
