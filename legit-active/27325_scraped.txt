Furthermore, Grey's Anatomy viewers will be able to catch The Republic Tigers on May 5th's episode.
The Republic Tigers arrived in 2008 with Keep Color, a kaleidoscopic burst of symphonic psych pop that was universally hailed for its unique multi-faceted approach.
The Kansas City-based quintet's Chop Shop Records debut featured an array of styles - spanning future folk, high-spirited rock, and candy-colored pop - melded into a truly original and ingenious sound.
Now, with the new No Land's Man EP, The Republic Tigers continue to develop their epic vision in advance of their eagerly anticipated sophomore album (slated for release later this year).
Putting their love of classic song craft out at the forefront, it serves as The Republic Tigers' melodic canvas for their unique aural expressionism. No Land's Man - is highlighted by the euphoric single, "Merrymake It With Me." Elsewhere the band reveal heretofore untapped gifts for big beat synth pop ["The Nerve (Nervous Dancing)"] and punchy Latin-tinged New Wave ("Lonely As I Was"), all the while carrying on the widescreen creativity that has marked their music from the start.
No Land's Man heralds the upcoming release of The Republic Tigers' much-anticipated, as-yet-untitled second album. While reluctant to give away too many of its secrets, Jankowski confirms that he and his fellow musical explorers remain on their own idiosyncratic path, fervently committed to the creation of The Republic Tigers' singular sonic magic.
The Republic Tigers are: Kenn Jankowski (Vocals, Guitar, Keys), Ryan Pinkston (Guitar, Vocals, Keys), Adam McGill (Guitar, Vocals), Marc Pepperman (Bass), Justin Tricomi (Drums, Vocals).
