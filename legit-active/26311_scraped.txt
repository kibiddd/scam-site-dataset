Kulbacki"We had the support beams on our front porch replaced! The renovations team did a great job! They were on time each day, provided suggestions and solutions to issues that surfaced (nothing they did), communicated well through the process and had GREAT follow up with the arrival of new materials that needed to be ordered. Everyone was great to work with and was very knowledgeable! We would definitely use MDi Built again! Great job, well done! Thank you!"S. Kershner"After years of trying to understand our tankless hot water heater and many calls to the installer (with no follow up) and local plumbers who didn't want to touch our heater, we decided to give MDi Built a call. We were given an appointment within two weeks and were pleasantly surprised when the technician arrived. He worked on the water heater and made some adjustments and also explained how this system worked. The adjustments our technician made fixed the problem of our shower temperature going from well-water cold to scalding hot. Our shower water now stays at a consistent temperature. We are very thankful to MDi Built for their prompt, reliable and reasonable costing service to fix our problem. Thanks!!"
