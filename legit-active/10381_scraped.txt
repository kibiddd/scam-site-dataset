Why chose Strategy First?
We are an Independent Financial Advice Firm who have been in the Financial Services industry since 2005, during a time when service was primarily commission-based.
From day one, Strategy First operated on a fee for service basis, meaning our recommendations are truly suited to your needs.
Independent
As of the 31 March 2021, we are proud to announce that Strategy First is officially an independent financial advisory firm.
What does this mean? This allows us to state we have no conflicts of interest; while continuing to deliver our advice and process that is fully aligned with our clients’ values.
Check out our list of Independent Financial Advisers.
Fee for Service
We provide advice on a pure ‘fee for service’ basis to ensure that you remain in control of the cost at all times.  Our costs are agreed upfront before any work is undertaken. There is no charge for the initial consultation.

Financial Wellbeing
Our goal is to help you achieve peace of mind.  We do this by focusing on the three broad areas that comprise your Financial Wellbeing:
Emotional Value – Helping you to feel confident and supported.Financial Value – Covering every facet of your financial life, our broad service offering ensures a holistic approach.Portfolio Value – Our proven philosophy is designed to optimise your investment experience.
We have a very honest and direct relationship, which we genuinely appreciate. Strategy First has given us peace of mind. You can't put a price on that.
Strategy First's longevity and continued success is a testament to your leadership and the great team you have built around you. When I think of Strategy First, I think of a business with integrity where the customer is always first and where service is consistent and responsive.
I have no qualms in recommending Strategy First. The team, under the leadership of David Price have earned my respect and admiration in managing my Self-Managed Superannuation Fund for many years. In an environment of highly volatile and unpredictable financial markets the fund has done well and I feel confident that the path proposed by Strategy First will continue to meet my needs for many years to come.
