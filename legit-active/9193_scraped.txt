George Stewart U.S. 40 Photograph No. 78 - Golconda Summit
Old Highway 40Golconda, NV 89414Without a doubt, this is my favorite location.  I've shot this scene a half dozen times over the year.  Access to the site is on an abandoned section of Route 40 ('Drive at your own risk') east of Golconda.  As Stewart pointed out, there are three alignments of the road visible here (not counting I-80 in the distance).
