Martinique
Martinique (French pronunciation: ​[maʁ.tinik]) is an insular region of France located in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a land area of 1,128 square kilometres (436 sq mi) and a population of 386,486 inhabitants (as of January 2013). Like Guadeloupe, it is an overseas region of France, consisting of a single overseas department. One of the Windward Islands, it is directly north of Saint Lucia, northwest of Barbados, and south of Dominica.
As with the other overseas departments, Martinique is one of the eighteen regions of France (being an overseas region) and an integral part of the French Republic. As part of France, Martinique is part of the European Union, and its currency is the euro. The official language is French, and virtually the entire population also speak Antillean Creole (Créole Martiniquais).
Etymology
Martinique owes its name to Christopher Columbus, who sighted the island in 1493, and finally landed on 15 June 1502. The island was then called "Jouanacaëra-Matinino", which came from a mythical island described by the Tainos of Hispaniola.  According to historian Sydney Daney, the island was called "Jouanacaëra" by the Caribs, which means "the island of iguanas".

Invasion of Martinique (1759)
A British invasion of Martinique took place in January 1759 when a large amphibious  force under Peregrine Hopson landed on the French-held island of Martinique and unsuccessfully tried to capture it during the Seven Years' War.  Cannon fire from the British fleet was ineffective against the fortress at Fort-Royal due to its location high on the cliffs, and there were no suitable landing places nearby.  Unknown to the British commanders, French governor Francis de Beauharnais had not been resupplied for some months, and even a brief siege would have led to the fort's capitulation.  However, Moore and Hopson decided instead to investigate the possibility of attacking Martinique's main commercial port, Saint-Pierre.   After a desultory naval bombardment on 19 January that again had little effect on the port's defenses, they withdrew, and decided instead to attack Guadeloupe, home to a significant body of French privateers.
The expedition was successful at Guadeloupe, which surrendered to them in May 1759.

Invasion of Martinique (1762)
The British expedition against Martinique was a military action that took place in January and February 1762.  It was part of the Seven Years' War.
Prelude
After the surrender of Dominica to a British expeditionary force, the French in Martinique fully expected the same expedition to head into their direction. Accordingly, they took measures for their defense. The French force in Martinique consisted of 1,200 regulars, 7,000 local militia and 4,000 hired privateersmen. Furthermore, the mountainous nature of the island made it rather easy to defend.
The neighbouring British islands did what they could to help the mother-country:
Antigua sent blacks and part of her old garrison, the 38th Regiment of Foot which had not left her since Queen Anne's day;
Barbados raised 500 black and 500 white men, which were the more acceptable since that island was the rendezvous for the expedition.
The first troops to arrive in Carlisle Bay were a detachment from Belle-Isle, Newfoundland consisting of:

P&O Cruises Caribbean port guide - Things to do in Martinique?
Welcome to my Caribbean Cruise port Guide - What to do in Martinique - Episode 7
If you are visiting Martinique my top tip would be to book an excursion in advance. We decided to get off and do our own thing but the queue along the jetty was so long by the time we queued and got to the beach we had in mind it would have been time to come home.
As i say in my video I have used the Facebook Group Caribbean Island Tours many times and they have some amazing excursions in Martinique that I would recommend. I have listed them here :-
Caribbean Pirates Tour
• Visit at the “village de la poterie” (potter village)
• Tour around the south-eastern coast
• Beach Anse d’arlet with bathing possibility
• Panoramic view on the “Rocher du diamant”
• Rum factory “Trois-Rivieres”
• Beach “Les Salines"
• ...

France: Island of Martinique Erupts Over Skyrocketing Food Prices | Firstpost America
Martinique, a picturesque French Caribbean island, is gripped by violent protests as residents revolt against skyrocketing living costs. Food prices are 40% higher than in mainland France, pushing people to the brink.

One person has already been killed, and over two dozen officers have been injured. The government has imposed a curfew and banned public gatherings, but tensions remain high. Protesters demand urgent action to align local prices with those of France, as frustration over economic inequality fuels the island's growing unrest.

Also, the video shows many different accommodations in very different areas on the island.
In the last episode you saw us on Barbados. Our cottage at Silver Sands Beach was perfect, overlooking the Caribbean Sea. We rented a car, cruised around the entire island and visited all the major sights and beaches: Miami Beach, Brownes Beach, Bridgetown, Paynes Bay, Animal Flower Cave, Bathsheba & the Soup Bowl and Bottom Bay. Before this we were on Dominica. CNN Travel listed the island among the most beautiful places on earth. We stayed in a tree house overlooking the jungle, swam through the Titou Gorge (made famous by Pirates of the Caribbean) and we explored the mountains full of waterfalls. Be sure to watch these episodes too!
The entire trip started already months ago in the Dominican Republic. We hopped over to Puerto Rico and visited Anguilla, Saint Martin, Saint Barth, Saint Kitts & Nevis and Antigua. After this episode we visit Saint Lucia, Grenada, Tobago and the Bahamas. Follow us on this Caribbean tour, now on Martinique and then in many other beautiful destinations in the Caribbean Sea.

Martinique - French Pearl in the Caribbean | Nature Documentary
The island of Martinique is a piece of France in the Caribbean, between Florida and South America. And of course, Savoir-vivre applies just as it does on the other side of the Atlantic, between the English Channel and the Mediterranean.
Jacky Pascault is the first and only man to cultivate mushrooms in the Caribbean. Everywhere else, they grow on artificially fertilised soil, but Jacky's Champignons Tropicaux flourish on sugar cane fibres.
Nicole Vilo tailors hats and dresses out of coconut palms. Of course, the catwalk for the models wearing her first collection is one of the countless dream beaches. The Martiniquais sail on boats they call Yole, which have no keel and are therefore difficult to navigate. The crew members hang over the water in breakneck fashion on long wooden poles. Just the job for Yole-boss Max' "problem kids": they not only learn complicated handling, but also team spirit.

Martinique is part of Caribbean France, also known as the French Antilles. The island is especially popular with French tourists, but actually a great destination for Europeans or Americans. Martinique is definitely worth it, especially because flying to this island is not very expensive from Paris, LA, London or Amsterdam. What is there to do? Amazing beaches, waterfalls, a special botanical garden and endless tropical rainforest! Watch the video and see how we start a trip through the Caribbean in Martinique.
From Martinique we visit many more hidden gems in the Caribbean, but now you can already see some of the highlights. We sleep in Saint Pierre, visit the top of Mont Pelée, stand under the waterfall Saut Gendarme, snorkel in Anse Dufour and Anne Noire and stroll over the most beautiful beaches called Plage du Diamant and Plage des Salines. Also, the video shows many different accommodations in very different areas on the island.
This year we travel all over the world and after the Canary Islands, Oman and Cape Verde, Martinique is our fourth destination. Follow us on this world trip, first in Martinique and then to many more beautiful destinations! We travel non-stop all year round and film everything. Also take a look at instagram @woutoftheworld or www.woutoftheworld.nl

Welcome to our fourth P&O Arvia Caribbean cruise series vlog! Today, P&O Arvia is in Martinique and we've got an exciting day planned as we've booked another excursion with Caribbean Island Tours on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/caribbeanislandtours/
Todays excursion takes us around the south coast of Martinique and includes the following stops:
We visit at the "village de la poterie" (potter village) before we have a chance to snorkle at Beach Anse d'arlet . After that we head to the view point for "Rocher du diamant" and then try shots of rum at rum factory "Trois-Rivieres". To end the day we visit the stunning beach of "Les Salines" before finally return via the south-western coast.
Back onboard we spend some more time at the swim up bar before heading to the Glass House for dinner - we also witness the spectacular pop up show in the main atrium.
Our vlogs aim to bring you along with us, they are fun and hopefully informative, if you are looking for in-depth information rather than a vlog be sure to check out our P&O Arvia Lets Talk Ship reviews over on our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjTgeP0Iv8Y&list=PLlyIX6uGK99TESOjNSGqjma4KOqlHRHHJ
All these vlogs can be found in our Caribbean vlog playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyIX6uGK99S5cY9dsF7ZD85pCxZSClzI
P&O Cruises' newest cruise ship P&O Arvia is sister to P&O Iona. You can expect energetic adventures, interactive family entertainment, one-of-a-kind dining experiences and soothing relaxation options. P&O Arvia has a capacity of 5200 passengers and has 26 Dining venues & bars, 6 Theatres & Lounges, 5 Pools and lots of hot tubs!
Our one week P&O Arvia cruise cost £1,099.00 per person and was booked via Martin's Holiday Village https://www.facebook.com/MartinsHolidayVillage

🐒🍌🚢  About Us  - Who are the Cruise Monkeys?
We are bananas about cruising! We started cruising in 2014 by doing a mini cruise on P&O Aurora. Making videos of our cruises and sharing our experiences has become our hobby – the complete video is filmed and edited on an iPhone. The videos are our opinions and experiences while on board - really they are us having fun and brining you along with us!
We may not be the youngest cruisers but we are trying to break the stereotype that cruising is for retired people. On a cruise you will normally find us wondering around the ship taking in the atmosphere (and working our way through the cocktails).
We have sailed on P&O Cruises, Cunard Line, Princess Cruises, MSC Cruises, Royal Caribbean and Avalon Waterways. We'd love to try Ambassador Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Fred Olsen, Holland America (HAL), Celebrity, Disney Cruises, Carnival Cruises, Costa, Aida, Marella and Celestyal.

🐒🍌🚢  About Us  - Who are the Cruise Monkeys?
We are bananas about cruising! We started cruising in 2014 by doing a mini cruise on P&O Aurora. Making videos of our cruises and sharing our experiences has become our hobby – the complete video is filmed and edited on an iPhone. The videos are our opinions and experiences while on board - really they are us having fun and brining you along with us!
We may not be the youngest cruisers but we are trying to break the stereotype that cruising is for retired people. On a cruise you will normally find us wondering around the ship taking in the atmosphere (and working our way through the cocktails).
We have sailed on P&O Cruises, Cunard Line, Princess Cruises, MSC Cruises, Royal Caribbean and Avalon Waterways. We'd love to try Ambassador Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Fred Olsen, Holland America (HAL), Celebrity, Disney Cruises, Carnival Cruises, Costa, Aida, Marella and Celestyal.

The island of Martinique is a piece of France in the Caribbean, between Florida and South America. And of course, Savoir-vivre applies just as it does on the other side of the Atlantic, between the English Channel and the Mediterranean.
Jacky Pascault is the first and only man to cultivate mushrooms in the Caribbean. Everywhere else, they grow on artificially fertilised soil, but Jacky's Champignons Tropicaux flourish on sugar cane fibres.
Nicole Vilo tailors hats and dresses out of coconut palms. Of course, the catwalk for the models wearing her first collection is one of the countless dream beaches. The Martiniquais sail on boats they call Yole, which have no keel and are therefore difficult to navigate. The crew members hang over the water in breakneck fashion on long wooden poles. Just the job for Yole-boss Max' "problem kids": they not only learn complicated handling, but also team spirit.

France: Island of Martinique Erupts Over Skyrocketing Food Prices | Firstpost America
Martinique, a picturesque French Caribbean island, is gripped by violent protests as residents revolt against skyrocketing living costs. Food prices are 40% higher than in mainland France, pushing people to the brink. What began as peaceful demonstrations have spiralled into chaos—burning barricades, looted stores, and clashes with police. One person has already been killed, and over two dozen officers have been injured. The government has imposed a curfew and banned public gatherings, but tensions remain high. Protesters demand urgent action to align local prices with those of France, as frustration over economic inequality fuels the island's growing unrest.

Martinique is the Caribbean paradise of France. It's the second biggest island of the French Antilles. Apart from French tourists, this tropical gem is actually a great destination for Europeans or Americans. Martinique is definitely worth it, especially because flying to this island is not very expensive from Paris, LA, London or Amsterdam. We fly there from Europe and after visiting some other island in the Caribbean, we have a family holiday on Martinique. So what is there to do? Get ready for amazing beaches, jungle waterfalls, a special botanical garden and endless tropical rainforest!
We sleep in Saint Pierre, visit the top of Mount Pelée, stand under the waterfall Saut du Gendarme, snorkel in Anse Dufour and Anne Noire and stroll over the most beautiful beaches called Plage du Diamant and Plage des Salines. Also, the video shows many different accommodations in very different areas on the island.
In the last episode you saw us on Barbados. Our cottage at Silver Sands Beach was perfect, overlooking the Caribbean Sea. We rented a car, cruised around the entire island and visited all the major sights and beaches: Miami Beach, Brownes Beach, Bridgetown, Paynes Bay, Animal Flower Cave, Bathsheba & the Soup Bowl and Bottom Bay. Before this we were on Dominica. CNN Travel listed the island among the most beautiful places on earth. We stayed in a tree house overlooking the jungle, swam through the Titou Gorge (made famous by Pirates of the Caribbean) and we explored the mountains full of waterfalls. Be sure to watch these episodes too!
The entire trip started already months ago in the Dominican Republic. We hopped over to Puerto Rico and visited Anguilla, Saint Martin, Saint Barth, Saint Kitts & Nevis and Antigua. After this episode we visit Saint Lucia, Grenada, Tobago and the Bahamas. Follow us on this Caribbean tour, now on Martinique and then in many other beautiful destinations in the Caribbean Sea. We travel non-stop all year round and film everything, with a new episode every week. Also take a look at instagram @woutoftheworld or www.woutoftheworld.com

Martinique - French Pearl in the Caribbean | Nature Documentary
The island of Martinique is a piece of France in the Caribbean, between Florida and South America. And of course, Savoir-vivre applies just as it does on the other side of the Atlantic, between the English Channel and the Mediterranean.
Jacky Pascault is the first and only man to cultivate mushrooms in the Caribbean. Everywhere else, they grow on artificially fertilised soil, but Jacky's Champignons Tropicaux flourish on sugar cane fibres.
Nicole Vilo tailors hats and dresses out of coconut palms. Of course, the catwalk for the models wearing her first collection is one of the countless dream beaches. The Martiniquais sail on boats they call Yole, which have no keel and are therefore difficult to navigate. The crew members hang over the water in breakneck fashion on long wooden poles. Just the job for Yole-boss Max' "problem kids": they not only learn complicated handling, but also team spirit.

Martinique is part of Caribbean France, also known as the French Antilles. The island is especially popular with French tourists, but actually a great destination for Europeans or Americans. Martinique is definitely worth it, especially because flying to this island is not very expensive from Paris, LA, London or Amsterdam. What is there to do? Amazing beaches, waterfalls, a special botanical garden and endless tropical rainforest! Watch the video and see how we start a trip through the Caribbean in Martinique.
From Martinique we visit many more hidden gems in the Caribbean, but now you can already see some of the highlights. We sleep in Saint Pierre, visit the top of Mont Pelée, stand under the waterfall Saut Gendarme, snorkel in Anse Dufour and Anne Noire and stroll over the most beautiful beaches called Plage du Diamant and Plage des Salines. Also, the video shows many different accommodations in very different areas on the island.
This year we travel all over the world and after the Canary Islands, Oman and Cape Verde, Martinique is our fourth destination. Follow us on this world trip, first in Martinique and then to many more beautiful destinations! We travel non-stop all year round and film everything.

Welcome to our fourth P&O Arvia Caribbean cruise series vlog! Today, P&O Arvia is in Martinique and we've got an exciting day planned as we've booked another excursion with Caribbean Island Tours on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/caribbeanislandtours/
Todays excursion takes us around the south coast of Martinique and includes the following stops:
We visit at the "village de la poterie" (potter village) before we have a chance to snorkle at Beach Anse d'arlet . After that we head to the view point for "Rocher du diamant" and then try shots of rum at rum factory "Trois-Rivieres". To end the day we visit the stunning beach of "Les Salines" before finally return via the south-western coast.
Back onboard we spend some more time at the swim up bar before heading to the Glass House for dinner - we also witness the spectacular pop up show in the main atrium.
Our vlogs aim to bring you along with us, they are fun and hopefully informative, if you are looking for in-depth information rather than a vlog be sure to check out our P&O Arvia Lets Talk Ship reviews over on our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjTgeP0Iv8Y&list=PLlyIX6uGK99TESOjNSGqjma4KOqlHRHHJ

🐒🍌🚢  About Us  - Who are the Cruise Monkeys?
We are bananas about cruising! We started cruising in 2014 by doing a mini cruise on P&O Aurora. Making videos of our cruises and sharing our experiences has become our hobby – the complete video is filmed and edited on an iPhone. The videos are our opinions and experiences while on board - really they are us having fun and brining you along with us!
We may not be the youngest cruisers but we are trying to break the stereotype that cruising is for retired people. On a cruise you will normally find us wondering around the ship taking in the atmosphere (and working our way through the cocktails).
We have sailed on P&O Cruises, Cunard Line, Princess Cruises, MSC Cruises, Royal Caribbean and Avalon Waterways. We'd love to try Ambassador Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Fred Olsen, Holland America (HAL), Celebrity, Disney Cruises, Carnival Cruises, Costa, Aida, Marella and Celestyal.

The island of Martinique is a piece of France in the Caribbean, between Florida and South America. And of course, Savoir-vivre applies just as it does on the other side of the Atlantic, between the English Channel and the Mediterranean.
Jacky Pascault is the first and only man to cultivate mushrooms in the Caribbean. Everywhere else, they grow on artificially fertilised soil, but Jacky's Champignons Tropicaux flourish on sugar cane fibres.
Nicole Vilo tailors hats and dresses out of coconut palms. Of course, the catwalk for the models wearing her first collection is one of the countless dream beaches. The Martiniquais sail on boats they call Yole, which have no keel and are therefore difficult to navigate. The crew members hang over the water in breakneck fashion on long wooden poles. Just the job for Yole-boss Max' "problem kids": they not only learn complicated handling, but also team spirit.

France: Island of Martinique Erupts Over Skyrocketing Food Prices | Firstpost America
Martinique, a picturesque French Caribbean island, is gripped by violent protests as residents revolt against skyrocketing living costs. Food prices are 40% higher than in mainland France, pushing people to the brink. What began as peaceful demonstrations have spiralled into chaos—burning barricades, looted stores, and clashes with police. One person has already been killed, and over two dozen officers have been injured. The government has imposed a curfew and banned public gatherings, but tensions remain high. Protesters demand urgent action to align local prices with those of France, as frustration over economic inequality fuels the island's growing unrest.

Martinique
Martinique (French pronunciation: ​[maʁ.tinik]) is an insular region of France located in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a land area of 1,128 square kilometres (436 sq mi) and a population of 386,486 inhabitants (as of January 2013). Like Guadeloupe, it is an overseas region of France, consisting of a single overseas department. One of the Windward Islands, it is directly north of Saint Lucia, northwest of Barbados, and south of Dominica.
As with the other overseas departments, Martinique is one of the eighteen regions of France (being an overseas region) and an integral part of the French Republic. As part of France, Martinique is part of the European Union, and its currency is the euro. The official language is French, and virtually the entire population also speak Antillean Creole (Créole Martiniquais).
Etymology
Martinique owes its name to Christopher Columbus, who sighted the island in 1493, and finally landed on 15 June 1502. The island was then called "Jouanacaëra-Matinino", which came from a mythical island described by the Tainos of Hispaniola.  According to historian Sydney Daney, the island was called "Jouanacaëra" by the Caribs, which means "the island of iguanas".
