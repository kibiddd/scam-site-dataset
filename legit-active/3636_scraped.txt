Lori Malcolm2024-09-16T19:23:17-05:00Cuba Missouri – A Town With StoriesIt’s exciting for everyone on a road trip to see things that entertain. That’s why Cuba Missouri should be on your Route 66 radar. We are a town with stories.
Cuba is a small community of about 3,500 people who collectively made a paradigm shift that changed the town for the better and sustainable for the future.
In 2001, the first mural was commissioned by Peoples Bank. Made possible by the volunteers of Viva Cuba, a community beatification group, the mural project caught the attention of many travelers.
After the first mural, Viva Cuba made a commitment to continue the project and added more murals. The unattractive walls overlooking Route 66 were soon covered in paint. The simple idea of a mural blossomed into decades of artistic expression in this small town.
Today, Cuba is proud to have 15 murals. Each mural shares a story via a QR code about the significance of the artwork to the community. Visitors can experience the art up close and stroll around town to other attractions, like the Crawford County Historical Society Museum. We are always on the lookout for new mural ideas.
Our murals are expressions of gratitude, hope, and history of the town’s many great stories. Our open-air artwork platform is accessible to all who visit. Whether it’s from the inside of a car or a walk around town, our murals capture the imagination of all ages. Wait till you see what’s coming…stay tuned!
Come to Cuba, a town with stories you can see and hear! Stay local and explore the many attractions in Cuba. Post your photos from around town on social media and tag us using #greetingsfromcubamo or #cubamomurals
See you soon!

WHAT IS VIVA CUBA?
In 1984, Viva Cuba, Inc. organized with the goal of beautifying Cuba to attract new industries and jobs. Many groups and individuals worked together in the early days to landscape Highway 19 and make it a more attractive entrance to Cuba.
In 1987, Viva Cuba became the first Adopt-A-Highway site in the state Over the years, planting continued, cleanup projects went forward, banners took their places in the community, and in the ’90s the Viva Cuba Garden, which has been enhanced, became a part of the four-way Hwy. 19 and Route 66 intersection. These efforts continue with maintenance and further improvements.
In 2001, Viva Cuba implemented a major project of commissioning 12 outdoor murals by Cuba’s 150th anniversary in 2007. Organizations and individuals supported Viva Cuba’s efforts and helped the organization reach its goal.  Today Viva Cuba maintains 14 murals and Cuba is known as “Route 66 Mural City”.  Since 2012, Cuba has been a Tree City USA Community.
