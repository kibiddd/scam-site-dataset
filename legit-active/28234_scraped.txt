About
I have always felt a strong affinity towards animals since I was a young girl. My parents thankfully gave into (most of) my; “What do you want for Christmas” responses, as it was always a request for a new furry friend as a gift!
Fast forward many moons later and I have my dream job as a veterinarian, getting to hang out with animals of all shapes and sizes every day. I hope to share with you what I have learned during my career and keep animal lovers in the loop with the latest and greatest information about animal welfare.
