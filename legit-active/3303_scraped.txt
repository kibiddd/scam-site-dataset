Used to listen to KFOG when I lived in the Bay area circa 85-86. I actually wasn't aware of a Grateful Dead Hour then on KFOG, and in fact the first Grateful Dead Hour I heard was in 1988 in Los Angeles (the show that featured the Beautiful Jam from a 1971 Dark Star into Wharf Rat, which I still have on cassette tape). However, the main reason I loved to listen to KFOG then was M. Dung. I loved his Sunday Night Idiot Show. You must have known M. Dung if you worked at KFOG at that time. At any rate, definitely will give this early show a listen. Report to follow.

M. Dung!
many tales to be told of that guy!  Where is he these days?
No M.Dung in this pic, but it's another blast from the KFOG Deadhead Hour.

Fine show .  The money theme in the 1st half could perfectly have a lot to do with our present world .  Although in 1987 it seemed as ' something ' was getting out of hand .
The Barlow interview is excellent .  I liked it very much , and seems like if he were to talk for longer , some more deeper stuff could come out .  he seems like a very ' deep ' person
My 2nd favourite band would have to be King crimson , but the Deads music has something that just keep s bringing you back time after time .  Fine musicianship and songwriting .
Have a great summer , and winter ( if you are in southern hemisphere as yours truly is ]

This early show reminds me of the late Utah Phillips's short-lived radio hour (too short-lived, I think), with a more thematic, narrative approach, involving the fast-paced sequencing of a diverse multitude of source materials.The snippets of Reagan still make me cringe. It's amazing the characters the GOP allows to rise through the ranks (think Nixon). No wonder they have to wear so much make-up on TV: how else cover that elongating brown nose? Who is that senator from Wyoming talking about Reagan's gazoo?
As to whether the Dead ever expressed any political sentiments, the impassioned readings of Saint of Circumstance and Ship of Fools should lay the question to rest. The Ship of Fools smokes, and Bobby really gets down at the end of Saint with some choice comments aimed at the enthralling apathy.
The idea of a featured guest with a song list is cool. Enjoyed Barlow's choices. It's like getting to know him as a person. Taste in music, which is so undefinable, as he says, says a lot about who we are, regardless.
Didn't Dirkson also record a version of Wild Thing?

Republican senator
The "gazoo" guy is then-senator Alan Simpson.  M Dung even posts here on DeadNet from time to time! (Or is it DeadNet Central where he posts?  I know I've run into him in one place or the other.) Gans/GD Hour blogGD Hour station list

Money Money
I had to listen to the first part of this again, just so I could hear that studio cut from Mars Hotel, "Money, Money." I remember this song pissed some people off when it first came out (specifically the "women's lib" reference) but it seems the Dead rarely, if ever, played it live, because the song is just so damn complex. It is really one of Bob's more involved tunes. There's just so much going on in there. And the way he builds sections around the central riff of the old Motown tune, also called Money, Money, reminds me of Shostakovich.

Hello Everyone
I am Alive and well :D I sure do miss seeing the good ol Grateful Dead. The Deadhead Hour has sure thrived thanks to David Gans. I sometimes think of all the insanity of that time, it sure was fun but frankly it almost killed me.
So...I had to go AWAY for a bit to recover :) If you need a dose of Dung checkout my site:

Long live the Grateful Dead!
