I'm A Fool To Care
by: Joe Barry
I'm a fool to careWhen you treat me this wayI know I love youBut what can I doI'm a fool to careI'm a fool to cryWhen you tell me goodbyeYou left me so blueWhen you were untrueI'm a fool to careI know I should laughAnd call it a dayBut I know I would cryIf you went awayI'm a fool to careWhen you don't care for meSo why should I pretendI'll lose in the endI'm a fool to careI know I should laughAnd call it a dayBut I know I would cryIf you went awayI'm a fool to careWhen you don't care for meSo why should I pretendI'll lose in the end
