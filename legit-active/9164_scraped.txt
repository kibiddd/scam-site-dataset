Good Faith Effort (GFE) Information & Pricing
What is a Good Faith Effort (GFE)?
A Good Faith Effort (GFE) is a documentation packet that demonstrates and documents a sincere effort by the prime bidder
to hire one or more Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) or Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB).
For certain Public Works or taxpayer-funded projects, prime bidding contractors must submit a GFE outreach
documentation packet alongside their formal construction or supplies bid. If the project involves Federal funds,
a GFE is mandatory. The Administering Local Agency, also known as the "Owner" of the project, defines and
publishes the GFE requirements, typically found in the bid documents or invitation to bid.
Various acronyms like DBE, DVBE, UDBE, MBE, WBE, and others represent specific DBEs, and qualification
details can be found on your state's DBE Certification website.
How Can CBS Help You?
Construction Bid Source, LLC, has been assisting contractors with GFE requirements since 1994.
As a Trade & Focus publication, we initially helped contractors fulfill GFE requirements as part of their
bidding process. Over time, contractors entrusted us with handling the entire GFE process.
We adhere to the United States Federal Department of Transportation (FDOT) standards when performing
the Owner's GFE requirements. We simplify the process by completing the GFE on your behalf
and delivering the completed document in PDF format. If you're overwhelmed or too busy to manage
the GFE process effectively, let us assist you.
