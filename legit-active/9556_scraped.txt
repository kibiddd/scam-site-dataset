Opt-Out Consent to Magistrate Judge Jurisdiction Takes Effect on March 4, 2025
Tuesday, January 21, 2025
Procedures for consenting to Magistrate Judge jurisdiction in civil cases filed on or after March 4, 2025, are governed by
2025-2 In Re Consent to Magistrate Judge Jurisdiction Pursuant to 28 USC 636.pdf
, which implements an opt-out consent procedure in cases randomly assigned to a Magistrate Judge. Cases within a Magistrate Judge’s jurisdiction are likely to proceed to trial more quickly than cases assigned to a District Judge, who must preside over felony criminal trials.
Pursuant to Standing Order 2025-2, consent procedures differ depending on whether a case is randomly assigned to a full-time Magistrate Judge, a part-time Magistrate Judge, or a District Judge.

Court Advisories
Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) Phishing Scam
The District of Oregon has received information that fake Notices of Electronic Filing (NEF) are circulating nationwide, including those that appear to originate with Oregon CM/ECF. If the recipient responds to the message, they are sent a follow-up email containing a link to access a document that leads the recipient to a malicious website.
The court would like to remind its users and the public that any e-mail that is not expected, encourages urgent action, or includes an attachment should be treated with caution, including e-mails purporting to be from the court. If in doubt, do not click any links or open any attachments, and verify the authenticity against the docket in PACER. The court does not send notifications to parties and attorneys that filings are due.
In addition, an official NEF from the District of Oregon CM/ECF system will always have the following characteristics:
The subject line will be "Activity in Case [case number] [case title] [filing]"
The message will be from
Any links within will direct to ecf.ord.uscourts.gov
The message will not be directly addressed to the recipient (recipients of NEFs are bcc'd)
NEFs do not issue to individuals who are not already users of Oregon CM/ECF
The NEF will not have any attachments
The NEF will not include instructions for next steps, e.g. the filing of a response
The NEF will include a list of all attorneys and parties to whom the NEF was also sent
Notice to Customers Presenting Checks
When you provide a check as payment, you authorize the Court either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction.  For inquiries, please call the Clerk's Office at 503-326-8000.
Privacy Act – A Privacy Act Statement required by 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3) that states our authority for soliciting and collecting the information from your check and explaining the purposes and routine uses which will be made of your check information, is available from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury, and may be obtained through the mail by calling 1-866-945-7920 (toll free). Furnishing the check information is voluntary, but a decision not to do so will require you to make payment by some other method.
Warning: Be Aware of Court-Related Phishing Scams
Members of the public are being targeted by phone calls, text messages, and e-mails that threaten prosecution or fines for failing to respond to a jury summons or subpoena or failing to appear for a proceeding. These communications are fraudulent and are not connected with the federal courts.
Recipients of such communications are pressured to provide confidential data such as banking information or to provide payment in the form of gift cards, credit cards, or similar to cover an alleged fine or remove an alleged warrant. Recipients are threatened with fines and jail time if they do not comply.
Members of the public are urged to learn to recognize and avoid such scams by watching for their hallmarks: demands for urgent action, requests for personal and/or financial information, or offers that are too good to be true.
Most contact between a District of Oregon court staff member and prospective juror or other member of the public will be through the U.S. mail or by e-mail, and any telephone contact by real court officials will not include requests for sensitive information. Federal officials do not demand payment of money in lieu of being arrested. Federal courts will also not serve a warrant or notify you of a warrant by e-mail, phone, or fax. If in doubt regarding a communication purporting to be from the District of Oregon, contact us for accurate information.
It is a crime for anyone to falsely represent a federal court official.  The federal judiciary takes such offenses seriously. If you believe that you have been the victim of fraud or have received a scam phone call, text, phishing e-mail, or fax, contact your local police department or the United States Marshals Service (503-326-2209 or www.usmarshals.gov/district/or/).
Notice Regarding Third-Party Services and CM/ECF Access
Registered users of Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) should be aware of the potential to inadvertently share docket and/or hearing information when using third-party services or software. Sharing your PACER account credentials with a third-party service provider or designating that provider as a secondary recipient of a Notice of Electronic Filing or Notice of Docket Activity (NEF) can potentially allow that third party access to restricted information. You are urged to use caution in your computer security practices to ensure that restricted information to which you have access is not disclosed.
