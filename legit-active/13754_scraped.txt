GIVE TO RSLP
Julian Robertson gave boldly and generously when he created the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program twenty-three years ago. He believed in the power of communities, and more importantly, he believed in the power of people to create a better world.
We launched a Generosity Campaign in his honor, asking you to do as he did: to give boldly and generously as we establish the Julian H. Robertson, Jr., Alumni Fund.
