Who was Marilyn Monroe?
Born in 1926 as Norma Jeane Mortensen, Monroe was many things, including a model, an actress, a movie star and an instantly recognizable icon. She was an extremely popular entertainer in her lifetime and has remained so in the decades since her tragic death in 1962. She continues to loom large in popular culture and in art of all kinds.
A Wide Variety of Marilyn Monroe Photos
While she was sometimes underestimated as a “blonde bombshell,” Marilyn Monroe was extremely intelligent, witty and passionate about her craft. Our Marilyn Monroe photos showcase all sides of her multifaceted personality. They include publicity shots and pictures from glamorous photo shoots, of course, but also photos of Marilyn reading, laughing and simply being herself. You’ll also find pictures of Marilyn Monroe on the sets of some of her most famous films, like “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” “The Seven Year Itch” and more.
Marilyn Monroe Paintings and Drawings
Of course, Marilyn also remains a frequent subject in the fine art world; Andy Warhol’s screen-printed Marilyn Monroe portrait series continues to delight and fascinate. In addition, many contemporary artists and art collectives create Marilyn Monroe artwork, resulting in eye-catching decorative art pieces. Choose your favorite Marilyn Monroe poster or print on premium archival paper, or have us print it on gallery-quality canvas, creating Marilyn Monroe canvas art that’s sure to make you smile – just like Marilyn still makes audiences smile with her film performances.
