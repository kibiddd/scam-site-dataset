We craft pottery with a uniquely Australian spirit.  We take enormous pride in both our Australian Designed imported collections, and our Melbourne made ranges. The design process is often a close collaboration between the Gordon family, staff, and our clients.  Our making process >
Creating with clay since 1945.  Just over forty years ago, Robert ‘Andy’ Gordon walked into a ten by eight foot tin shed, picked up a lump of clay and turned his potters wheel. The Pack Track Pottery was born. But the story and inspiration for Robert Gordon dates long before 1979 and a rickety home made studio.  Learn our history >
Robert Gordon / Limited Edition  This season, we are excited to launch the latest Robert Gordon collection to come from our Pakenham Workshop. Studio Door is a series of hand crafted, hand painted pieces, available as a limited edition. We aim to craft only 50 of each vessel, ensuring that the items remain unique, rare and one-of-a-kind. Once Studio Door opens, and selling begins, you must get in quick. Sold out is sold out.
