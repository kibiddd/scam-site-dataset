Artist of the Month: Morris E. Day of The Original 7ven (Formerly The Time)October 25, 2011|In Artist of the Month, Funk, Pop, R&B, Rock, Soul|By Hope West
Known for his¬† narcissistic persona , Morris Day is notorious for being the primping playboy with the egotistical mantra of his own greatness. In being this flamboyant gigolo with the chili sauce, he is the man every woman wants and every man hopes to be. But in addition to his larger than life role as the front man of The Original 7ven, he‚Äôs also a drummer in his own right. Playing percussions with Prince‚Äôs early band, Grand Central and later creating the song Partyup, placed on Prince‚Äôs Dirty Mind album, Morris later created The Time where he played drums and co-produced some of the albums while unexpectedly becoming the lead vocalist in its early formation. Initially uncomfortable in being the lead, he later eased into it like a nice pair of Stacy Adams. While we‚Äôll play Fishnet from his solo album, Daydreaming,¬† we‚Äôll also check out the comical track, Tricky. This cut was a non album track showing the comical banter between him and Prince along with Morris‚Äô skills on the drums.
To find out his musical influences and the drummer he said ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt f**k with him‚Äù on their best day üôÇ , you gotta pick up the Condensate album from Best Buy for the DVD bonus! It‚Äôs a must for any Original 7ven fan! Yaayeesss!!!
Hope WestHope West is¬†a¬†music enthusiast and music photographer who has captured artists like B.B.

She‚Äôs also a proud ‚ÄúFlorida Girl‚Äù born and raised in¬†Ft. Lauderdale, Fl. and currently resides in Atlanta, GA as a ‚ÄúGeorgia Peach‚Äù. Hope is known for her creativity, sense of humor and quirky perfectionism. Artist(s) that make her freak out as a music fan: Sheila E., Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Quincy Jones.
