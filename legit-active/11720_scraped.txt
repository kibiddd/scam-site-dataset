We get some clues during the series, but enough to keep us interested in the mini-series. The characters are all believable and I personally felt immersed and surrounded by the story.andialuMay 23, 1999PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ18How many seasons does The Tenant of Wildfell Hall have?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateNovember 17, 1996 (United Kingdom)Country of originUnited KingdomLanguageEnglishAlso known asLa inquilina de Wildfell HallFilming locationsSyon House, Syon Park, Brentford, Middlesex, England, UK(London ballroom)Production companiesBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)WGBHSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime53 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1996) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
