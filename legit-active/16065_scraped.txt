Propertybase users: Log in here
As a real estate brokerage, your online presence is your key to success—and the CRM software you use to reach potential clients has a big hand in that.
Not too long ago, we introduced the new generation of real estate software, including Lone Wolf Foundation, a groundbreaking new platform to bring brokerages one login, one workflow, and one client database for their most-used real estate apps.
We’re thrilled to share that Propertybase GO has now become Lone Wolf Front Office, and is available in Lone Wolf Foundation today to make your website and CRM work simpler, and connect your software with other solutions throughout your brokerage.
Breaking down barriers for your most critical activities
As CEO Jimmy Kelly explained following Lone Wolf’s acquisition of Propertybase in 2022, there’s a big need for key software like transaction management, back office, CRM, and websites to come together:
“Our customers want—and need—these essential solutions to work together, so they can run their entire business in one place.”
Today, we’re taking it a step further to create a simpler system for the real estate software you know and trust. Together with Lone Wolf Foundation and solutions like Lone Wolf Back Office and Lone Wolf Transact, Propertybase is becoming part of the new generation of Lone Wolf software.
