Stefon Diggs
NE
Wide Receiver
#1
Personalize your Rotoworld feed by favoriting players
Patriots signed WR Stefon Diggs, formerly of the Texans, to a three-year, $69 million contract.
ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Diggs’ contract includes $26 million guaranteed. The 31-year-old tore his ACL in Week 8 last season and may not be ready for Week 1. However, the Patriots needed a veteran wide receiver to add to a middling group that saw no wideouts over 700 receiving yards and just DeMario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte over 400 yards last season. Diggs was a Pro-Bowler and 1,000-yard receiver each season from 2020-2023 with the Bills and caught 47 passes for 497 yards and three touchdowns for the Texans in 2024. Still a top target-earner when healthy, Diggs will aid QB Drake Maye’s development while the Pats grow the offense. Fantasy managers can treat Diggs as a stash that will have fantasy WR2 upside as the season goes on.
Russell Wilson
NYG
Quarterback
#3
Giants signed QB Russell Wilson, formerly of the Steelers, to a one-year, $21 million contract.
Wilson has found a suitor in the Giants, signing a one-year deal worth up to $21 million, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The deal also includes $10.5 million guaranteed. The Giants were in the market for a veteran quarterback and now have two after also signing Jameis Winston. The dominos will continue to fall as the Steelers are still without a quarterback, though Aaron Rodgers seems destined for Pittsburgh despite the snail-like speed of his free agency decision. Meanwhile, Wilson is now poised to start for the Giants in 2025 after throwing for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions in 11 games for the Steelers last season. The ceiling for Malik Nabers and the Giants’ pass-catchers is lower with Wilson than Winston and the addition of the two veteran quarterbacks indicates the team will either pick a rookie to sit the entire 2025 season, or wait until the 2026 draft to add a rookie quarterback.
Cam Ward
FA
Quarterback
#7
ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Titans will hold an additional private workout with Miami QB Cam Ward.
“The Titans have become increasingly impressed with Ward and, while they are expected to listen to offers for the No. 1 overall pick, it now would take an even stronger package to acquire the draft’s top selection,” Schefter says. This is quickly barrelling into either consensus No. 1 overall pick territory or one of the great rug pulls of all-time to try to generate more trade interest for the selection. We’d bet on the former given how exuberant the praise from Titans staff has become. If the Titans bring some of their own offensive players to this private workout it will likely be a glaring neon sign that Ward is going No. 1 overall.
Shedeur Sanders
Quarterback
ESPN’s Adam Schefter believes even if the Giants sign Russell Wilson, they may select Shedeur Sanders at No. 3 overall.
The links between the Giants and Sanders have been obvious since the 2024 season was left for dead in November. Schefter points out that he had New York Giants cleats on before the Alamo Bowl. It certainly would appear that the Giants at No. 3 should be an unsurprising outcome for Sanders in this draft. Assuming the Titans select Cam Ward No. 1 overall — which certainly appears to be the consensus right now — the Browns will probably have to take Sanders at 2 if they want him.
J.J. McCarthy
MIN
Quarterback
#9
J.J. McCarthy said the Vikings have not told him he’ll be the team’s starting quarterback in 2025.
McCarthy told Kay Adams on Monday that Minnesota coaches had not named him the starter after the team said last week it would not pursue Aaron Rodgers “at this time.” Coming off a knee injury that cost him his entire rookie campaign, McCarthy appears to be the favorite for the team’s Week 1 starting job. His recovery and performance in training camp could complicate things, however. NFL Network reported last week that the Vikings had rejected trade calls for McCarthy this offseason. McCarthy would certainly be set up for success in Kevin O’Connell’s quarterback-friendly system: The pass-catching trio of Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, and TJ Hockenson is one of the best in the league.
Tetairoa McMillan
FA
Wide Receiver
The Athletic’s Matt Schneidman predicts the Packers “break the 22-year streak and take a wide receiver in the first round” of this year’s draft.
As Schneidman points out, Packers GM Brian Gutekunst was the only GM to appear at a private workout for Arizona’s Tetairoa McMillan. McMillan is currently ranked as the No. 7 prospect on Dane Brugler’s top 100 and could become the first wide receiver drafted in the first round by the Packers since they took Javon Walker in 2002. McMillan may not fall to the Packers, who currently hold the No. 23 overall pick in the draft, necessitating a trade up. But in a draft that could feature three or four first-round picks at the position, Green Bay should have options if they want to upgrade at receiver.
Puka Nacua
LAR
Wide Receiver
#17
Speaking on the Join the Lobby podcast, Puka Nacua said he wants to retire at age 30.
Nacua said on a recent podcast appearance that he might call it quits after another six or seven seasons in the NFL. “I’m 23 right now, I’m going into year three – it wouldn’t even be 10 years. It’d be maybe seven or eight,” said Nacua, who has had one of the most productive starts a career in NFL history. “I think of Aaron Donald, to go out at the top, I think it would be super cool. But also, I want to have a big family.” Nacua said he wants to avoid a long career full of injuries that could wear on him into his 30s after during his post-NFL life. “By the time my kids could be 18, I could be barely walking if you play the game and sustain all the injuries and stuff like that, but I want to retire early,” he said. Nacua since entering the league in 2023 has sustained injuries to his foot, both ankles, knee, chest, hamstring, shoulder, and brain. His playing style might not be conducive to a lengthy career.
Aaron Rodgers
FA
Quarterback
#8
Speaking on the Pat McAfee Show, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Aaron Rodgers meeting with the Steelers “went really well.”
Rodgers met with the Steelers on Friday in a meeting that flew largely under the radar prior to his arrival at the team’s facilities. NBC’s Mike Florio reported shortly after the meeting that it’s a “safe bet” that Rodgers will eventually sign with the Steelers, but it doesn’t sound like Rodgers is in a rush to put pen to paper. The 41-year-old has had a limited market since news of his impending release from the Jets surfaced, but the Steelers are the only team that is simultaneously viewed as contenders who would be willing to let him start for them in 2025. Unless an unexpected team emerges as a suitor, Rodgers joining the Steelers sounds more like a matter of when than if.
Kirk Cousins
ATL
Quarterback
#18
Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports Kirk Cousins could waive his no-trade clause after next month’s draft.
Cousins wants to avoid the situation he found himself in last season. Less than two months after signing a four-year, $180 million deal with the Falcons last year, Cousins watched as the Falcons surprisingly went out and drafted Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 overall pick in the draft. The selection of Penix immediately put pressure on Cousins to perform well to remain as the team’s starter, but by Week 16, Penix was named the starter while Cousins quickly became the highest-paid backup in the league. The Falcons have appeared more than willing to keep Cousins on the roster for the upcoming season, but a trade would benefit all sides, as it would give Cousins a chance to play and the Falcons a chance to pick up some assets in return. With the draft concluding on April 26th, it’s possible we’ll know Cousins’ new landing spot come May.
Russell Wilson
FA
Quarterback
#3
ProFootballTalks’ Mike Florio reports Russell Wilson “remains on the Giants’ radar” despite their signing of Jameis Winston.
As long as Brian Daboll has a job to save in 2025, we can expect the Giants to exhaust any and all options at quarterback if the price is right. Despite the team signing Winston to a two-year deal worth up to $16 million last week, Wilson continues to be a potential option for Big Blue. According to Florio, his source also said the Giants “technically remain in the mix for Aaron Rodgers,” while adding the future HOFer is unlikely to join the team. Wilson has met with the Browns and Giants this offseason and could still wind up returning to the Steelers. That said, the Steelers seem to be waiting on Rodgers, the Giants do have Winston in place, and the Browns are holding the No. 2 overall pick in next month’s draft. We’ll likely know Wilson’s landing spot before the start of camp, but it’s possible the team’s most interested in him will wait to see how the draft plays out before committing to him.
