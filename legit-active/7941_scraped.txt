Scott Corbett Bibliography
Scott
Corbett wrote five
adult novels before writing sixty-nine books for
young readers. W.
Scott Corbett was born in Kansas City in 1914.
He graduated from the
University of Missouri at Columbia in 1934 with
a bachelor of
journalism degree, subsequently moving to New
York as a freelance
writer. His
first novel, The
Reluctant Landlord
was purchased by 20th Century Fox as the basis
for the 1951 movie Love Nest, starring
June
Haver,
William
Lundigan,
and
Marilyn
Monroe. The movie rights allowed the Corbetts to
move from New
York to Cape Cod in 1951.He wrote his first
children's book in 1956
with Susie Sneakers, which was inspired
by a visit from his
niece. Thereafter he focused solely on writing
juvenile fiction. In
1957 they moved to Providence, Rhode Island,
where he was a teacher at
Moses Brown School. He stopped teaching in 1967
to write full-time.
Scott Corbett died on Monday, March 6, 2006 at
the age of 92. You can

Journal
