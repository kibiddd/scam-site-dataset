My research: Joachim a/k/a "Josiah" Mooso dit Mousseau, son of Joseph Mousseau & Marie Elizabeth Angelique Levesque from Lavaltrie, Quebec, CANADA.Born 1788 (?) in Repentigny L'Assomption, Queb, CA, died betw. 1870-1880 in Pulaski, Iowa County, Wisconsin.Married Feb. 02, 1818 Victoire (dit DuFort) BOUGRET, daughter of Jean-Baptiste DuFort dit Bougret & Josette Gervais, in Montreal, Quebec @ St. Roch del'Achigan, L'Assomption, Quebec. I understand all Joachim's children also go by spelling of MOOSO. Joachim & Victoire's children are: 1. Josiah Antoine Mooso, b. 29 Nov 1818, m. Edna Sarah Hinman (they had 11 children) 2. Nelson Mooso, b. 22 Aug. 1820, m. Matilda LeMargue (they had 8 children) 3.Louis Mooso, b. 10 Feb 1823, m. ???Mrs. Saphronia Mousseau --- very confusing to me too!(they had 5 children) 4.Francois Xavier Mooso, b. 27 Oct 1824.No other info found. 5.Vital Desilet Mooso, b. 17 Nov 1826.No other info found. 6.Marie ???? Mooso, b. 1827 about, m. Julie Archambeault a/k/a Archambault.No other info found. Lots more info if you want it.If interested, email me. Sally Rose Blach Michigan Mousseau's Daughter of Georgina M.
