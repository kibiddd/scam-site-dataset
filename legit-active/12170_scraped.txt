SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY BASEBALL PLAYERS
MLB Players Who Played Collegiately at San Diego State University | Baseball Almanac
Baseball Almanac is pleased to present a comprehensive chart of every San Diego State University alumni who played baseball at San Diego State University AND made it to the Major League level.
"Not just us at San Diego State, everybody in San Diego County, we play a good brand of college baseball. We'd like to get the people out and go watch some college games before the big leaguers get back to town. It's really interesting stuff and, of course, we're never going to turn down any checks, we're never going to turn down any money because it's tough." - San Diego State Alumnus & Coach Tony Gwynn

SDSU MLB Players | Reserch by Baseball Almanac
The San Diego State University baseball program started in 1898. Pete Coscorart was the first former Aztec to make it to the Major League level. Names that appear on the chart above in bold print are in the San Diego State University Hall of Fame.
The San Diego State University athletic teams are known as the Aztecs, a change which became effective in February of 1925. Their fight song is posted below:
Fight on and on ye Aztec menSons of MontezumaWe will win againKeep your spirits highNever bow a kneeWe will fight till victory
Fight on and on ye Aztec menProudly raise your banners highFor it's the Red and BlackHail to our teamSan Diego Aztecs fight!
Did you know that there were forty-nine former San Diego State University ballplayers (and Tony Clark, who did not play with the Aztecs, and transferred to the University of Arizona) who made it to the majors? Too easy? Did you know Kevin Kennedy, a former Aztec, never made it to the majors as a player, but did manage two big league teams? Send updates to Baseball Almanac.
Where what happened yesterday is being preserved today.
