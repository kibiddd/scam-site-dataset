Now you can get a taste of Texas that restaurant reviewers have raved about for years.Underwood’s had its beginning during the Depression in the 1930’s when a Brady, Texas, butcher by the name of M.E. Underwood started cooking and selling Bar-B-Q door-to-door in order to make ends meet for his growing family.  By the early 40’s he had built a small white frame shack by the side of the road, and opened the first of what would become a chain of Take-Out Bar-B-Q places.
