I don't even need thePortland Timbers to win another game this inaugural season. I don't need anything more from the MLS club than they've already given me.They've been fun. They've been memorable. And Darlington Nagbe's first career goal still makes me stop cold and watch anytime anyone replays it. What I'm saying is the Timbers haven't just been relevant, they've delivered as promised. While we're watching the NBA let us all down, two weeks at a time, all that the Timbers deliver is probably worth noting.I've stopped telling people, "I'm not a soccer guy." It's not that I suddenly love the game. But I've come to appreciate a business that promises a fun environment, and interesting play, and by golly, delivers just that.It's a wondrous thing, soccer.Because while there's only one ball and two nets, it seems there's a thousand opinions on how to best proceed. And I find myself with thoughts on the journey of Kenny Cooper, and coach John Spencer's substitution patterns. I've delighted with their highs, and fell flat with their lows. And in that, I'm appreciative that a sports operation is doing what our culture asks a sports operation to do.The Timbers play their final home game of the season on Friday at Jeld-Wen Field against Houston. Then, two road games (at D.C. and Salt Lake). But it's the image of that home opener so many months ago, with a national television audience, and a home crowd singing the national anthem that I will never forget.Soccer sucks, right?It's slow. It can be boring. It's not an American game. You can say all of that, right up until you're in the stadium, understanding that the joy in a Timbers season is as much about the experience as it is the understanding of the play. I've walked the stadium. I've seen the smiles, and children, and every time I do, I feel like a bad parent for waiting so long to bring the 9-year old with me.Is there a better professional sports experience in Portland?Not the Blazers, who are locked out and saddled with lost ownership and management. Not either the Winterhawks, who are ambitious and trying to fight out of the shadows. And so I'll be curious to see if the Timbers, who have won a windfall of sponsorships and season-ticket interest, can transfer the enthusiasm from Season 1.0 into Season 2.0.Will they win you over? And if you've been here this season, will you be there next? Those are the kinds of questions that cause a sports franchise to go from a nice experience to a community institution. And while I've heard the interest in the Timbers described as 18,627 rabid people, but not 18,628.I'm thinking I could be No. 18,628. I'm thinking you might, too.I've found the players accessible and interesting. I've found the coach fascinating and passionate. I've found the play decent enough. And while I don't need the Timbers to make the playoffs this season, I do need progress next season.I was in Colorado for the season opener. The bright lights of the MLS came on, andthe Timbers wilted.I wondered if they'd figure it out. And I've been delighted this season to tune in, or drop in, and find a team suddenly playing as though it believes it belongs in the league.Not only that, it belongs in this city.I know it's cool to bash soccer. I've done it plenty. But as I sat to write this column, I thought about the long line of disappointments that this city has encountered when it's come to failed sports franchises. I drove past the Rose Garden Arena this week, and thought how absurd it is that it's possible that we could end this calendar year with Taylor Swift having more fruitful playing time there than LaMarcus Aldridge this fall.Timbers fans buy tickets and invest time and income. In return, they get a good, rewarding experience. I suppose we shouldn't give too much credit for getting exactly what you pay for, and expect. But then again, it's not always that way.--John CanzanoIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
