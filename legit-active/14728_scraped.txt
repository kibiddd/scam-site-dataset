History
History
The History Department at Slemish believes that a study of the past is pivotal to ensuring a better future for our society. At Slemish we encourage our students to think critically about the historical events and form their own judgements and interpretations.
At Key Stage 3 students have the opportunity to develop core historical skills through the study of a broad range of time periods and topics.  We investigate key historical turning points such as the Norman Conquest of Britain, The Black Death, The Renaissance and The Treatment of Jews in Germany.  We also challenge our students to examine controversial historical events such as the Slave Trade, The Plantation of Ulster and The Troubles in Northern Ireland.
At Key Stage 4 we study the CCEA specification, studying Life in the United States of America, 1920–33 and Changing Relations: Northern Ireland and its Neighbours, 1965–98 in the first year of the course. In the second year we focus on International Relations from 1945–2003.
History is a very popular option at A Level and our students study four separate units over the two-year course.  In Year 13 students study Germany 1919–45 and Ireland 1823–67 and in Year 14, The American Presidency 1901–2000 and the Partition of Ireland 1900–25.
