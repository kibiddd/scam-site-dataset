List of fatal, unprovoked shark attacks in the United States
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search
This is a list of fatal, unprovoked shark attacks that occurred in United States territorial waters by decade in reverse chronological order. Fatal shark attacks that resulted from provocation (e.g. shooting the shark with a speargun) are not included; neither are attacks that occurred outside U.S. territorial waters (e.g. the shark attacks which occurred after the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in WWII would not be included here).
Four species of sharks account for the vast majority of fatal attacks on humans: the bull shark, tiger shark, oceanic whitetip shark and the great white shark.

I'm going down,  What is the topic of discussion in your thread?  Do you agree with this or disagree with this?  Is there some connection with something else?
You are not giving us much to discuss when you just copy and paste.

If you read the entire post, it should have generated an emotional reaction.  Sailor Steve - mistakes happen.
The X rated version of Jaws was called "Gums."

What kind of emotional reaction are you looking for? Should we close the beaches? Figure out a way to kill all the sharks?
I'm with Platapus - I don't know what it is you want to discuss with this. I'm also with him on the thought that it's weird to see an entire article copied and pasted, including all the references.

This is a good start!  Let's discuss this!
Since you started the thread, you first.  What emotional response did you get from the article you copied and why do you feel that way?
After that, I will be glad to join the discussion and share my feelings on this.

You have a better chance of being hit by a bus while crossing the street than, being eaten by a shark.

Humans must realize that when they leave human civilization and enter the animal world, they cease being considered human and will be considered another animal -- one that can be eaten.

Every day more sharks are killed by people than the number of people ever killed by sharks in the entire history of sharks.
Every day more people are killed by people than sharks have ever killed people.
Conclusion?
People sux!
