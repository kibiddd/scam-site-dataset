German postcard by Kolibri-Verlag G.m.b.H., Minden/Westf., no. 1071. Photo: Cinelux / Deutsche Cosmopol-film (DCF) / Haenchen. Joachim Hansen in Der Schatz vom Toplitzsee/The Treasure in Toplitz Lake (Franz Antel, 1959). Blonde German actor Joachim Hansen (1930 - 2007) was best known for his starring roles in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He played in over 70 films and TV series. Later he was often cast in international films in roles portraying Nazi officers and officials.  After following acting classes at the Max-Reinhardt-Schule in Berlin he started first his stage career. Director Alfred Weidenmann asked him for the lead in the WW II film Der Stern von Afrika (1957, Alfred Weidenmann). This epic about the popular pilots of the German Luftwaffe became the most successful German cinema production of the year and meant a national breakthrough for Hansen and his co-stars Hansjörg Felmy, Horst Frank and Peer Schmidt. The new star followed his hit up with popular films like Madeleine und der Legionär (1957, Wolfgang Staudte) with Hildegard Knef, Hunde, wollt ihr ewig leben (1958, Frank Wisbar), the Heimat-melodrama Das Erbe von Björndal (1960, Gustav Ucicky), Via Mala (1961, Paul May), with Gert Fröbe and Christine Kaufmann, and the Edgar Wallace adaptation Das Geheimnis der schwarzen Koffer (1962, Werner Klingler). Between 1957 and 1962 he played leads in 19 feature films. From the mid 1960’s on Joachim Hansen appeared in such international hits as Paris brûle-t-il? (1966, René Clément), The Bridge at Remagen (1968. John Guillermin), Le vieux fusil (1975, Robert Enrico), The Eagle Has Landed (1976, John Sturges) and The Boys From Brazil (1978, Franklin J. Schaffner). He portrayed Lt. Gen. Alfred Jodl in the tv mini-series adaptations of Herman Wouks' The Winds of War (1983, Dan Curtis) and War and Remembrance (1988, Dan Curtis, Tommy Groszman). He often portrayed the German military who believed till the end in ‘Führer, Volk und Vaterland. In Germany he played in films like Operation Walküre (1971, Franz Peter Wirth) in which he portrayed Graf Stauffenberg, and he also acted in two tv films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Welt am Draht (1973) and Nora Helmer (1974). He emigrated to Canada in 1986 but returned occasionally to Germany to work on the stage or for tv.  Sources: Wikipedia, Steffi-line.de, Entertainment Insider and IMDb.
