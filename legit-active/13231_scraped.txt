Spencer Davis Wins 20th Annual Easter Bunny 150
Spencer Davis Wins 20th Annual Easter Bunny 150
By Zach Evans on Mar 15, 2025 and Racing America
After nearly 300 laps of green-flag racing across two days for the PASS Super Late Models at Hickory Motor Speedway, the Easter Bunny 150 came down to an 11-lap brawl for the win on Saturday.
Spencer Davis took the win in the 20th Easter Bunny 150 after a furious, physical battle with Joey Doiron in the closing laps, leading to an exchange of words between the two drivers post-race.
Davis took the lead from Garrett Hall on the 49th lap of the race, and appeared destined for a runaway victory in a second green-to-checkered event during Easter Bunny Weekend. On Friday, Doiron dominated the St. Patrick's Day 150, which went caution-free.
However, a spin for Mark Henderson on lap 139 erased Davis' advantage and set up an 11-lap shootout to determine the outcome of Saturday's race. ﻿Davis lined up on the inside of the front row for the finale restart, with Doiron to his outside after charging through the field from starting outside the top 10.
Doiron pulled ahead on the restart, but the fight was far from over. Davis moved to the inside of Doiron with nine laps to go, and the two drivers made contact multiple times over the final laps. In the end, Doiron slid up the track in turn four after contact from Davis with two laps to go, allowing the Georgia driver to move out front for the final time and score his first career PASS win.
“We had to work for it, you know what I mean?" said Davis in victory lane. "That was fun. We had the dominant car. He took his chance. I took it back.
“I bet that was an awesome last 10 laps right there. A little bit rough, but hey, an eye for an eye, bud.”
Davis hoped the race would go caution-free, as the St. Patrick's Day 150 had on Saturday, but wasn't prepared to let his convincing victory slip away.
“That’s a bummer. First race went all-green. Hey, man, you’ve got to prevail. These drives don’t come often. When someone else is paying the bills, you’ve got to take it.”
Davis and Doiron shared words after climbing out of their cars on the frontstretch following the race. Doiron shared his frustration with Davis in his post-race commentary.
“I forgot how we race in the south," said Doiron. "It is what it is. They won. Honestly, they were probably going to win if the caution didn’t come out.
“I got by him clean on the start, and he just lines me up. I got him back, pushed him up the track, got under him, didn’t touch him after that. Then he just kept hitting me until he could get me out of the way. Luckily, the 94 [of Hall] got inside of me there, or he probably wouldn’t have made turn one.
“It is what it is. We had a good weekend, and we’ll get ready to go racing up north.”
Hall was content to finish third after experiencing a flashback to one year ago at Hickory. As Davis and Doiron battled for the win, he recalled being collected in an incident involving Cole Butcher and Mike Hopkins during the 2024 St. Patrick's Day 150, taking away a chance to win for all three drivers.
“When I was watching them beat and bang up there, I was having a little déjà vu of last year, when I got taken out of third by [Mike] Hopkins and [Cole] Butcher when they got together," said Hall. "I wasn’t quite sure what was going to happen there. I was being a little cautious, but at the same time, maybe I shouldn’t have been. Maybe I would have been in position number one."
Sylas Ripley finished fourth, with Caden Kvapil rounding out the top five after a third-place effort in Friday's St. Patrick's Day 150.
The points-paying season for the Pro All Stars Series Super Late Models begins on March 29 at Thompson Speedway. The PASS Super Late Models will contest a 75-lap feature as part of the 51st Icebreaker at the famed Connecticut facility.

Joey Doiron Wins St. Patrick's Day 150
Joey Doiron Wins St. Patrick's Day 150
by Zach Evans on Mar 14, 2025  and Racing America
Joey Doiron blistered the competition on Friday night at Hickory Motor Speedway, taking a convincing victory in a caution-free St. Patrick's Day 150 for the PASS Super Late Models.
Doiron took the lead on lap 32 from Spencer Davis and never looked back, stretching out a lead of more than three seconds in the first-caution-free race in PASS Super Late Model history at Hickory.﻿﻿
"We could have used a yellow at the beginning," said Doiron in victory lane. "But with how our car was, I was fine with it going green-to-checkered. ﻿
It was a flawless Friday evening for Doiron, but they hardly work out that way historically for the Berwick, Maine driver. Before Friday's win, his only top-10 PASS finish at Hickory was a sixth-place run in the 2023 St. Patrick's Day 150.
﻿"We've never had much luck here," ﻿said Doiron. "We've crashed a lot. It feels good, we brought our best car here. We felt like if we were going to come down again, we needed to give it our best chance. Obviously, it was pretty good."
While the Easter Bunny Weekend doubleheader does not count for PASS points, it's still a great start to the season for Doiron. Coming off a year where he won three PASS races, including the inaugural Celebration of America 300 and the PASS 400 at Oxford Plains Speedway, Doiron hopes to carry that momentum into 2025.
﻿"Last year was pretty incredible. ﻿It would be pretty hard to top that, but we're starting off on the right foot."
Garrett Hall scored the runner-up finish in the 150-lap feature. While the handling of his car was starting to go away after 150 green-flag laps, he was content with the second-place effort.
"We had a lot of fun out there," said Hall. "The car ran good. It was just a little bit free, but you can't complain. Maybe I ﻿should have run it a little bit harder at the beginning, but overall, I'm happy with a second-place finish. We'll move on and try to work on it a little bit tomorrow.﻿
"It's one of those things where, at the beginning of the race, we wanted to maintain fourth or fifth place, just ride and maybe there would have been a caution. I don't know if we would have had anything for Joey, but it definitely would have been fun to try."﻿
In the closing laps, Caden Kvapil passed Davis for third place in the final running order. Kvapil hoped for a caution or two to gain on the leaders, but is optimistic going into Saturday's Easter Bunny 150.
"It was a little difficult there, 150 straight," said Kvapil. "﻿I wish we had a yellow or two there to break it up a little bit, give us a little more of a chance. I thought we had the car to beat with how we did in practice. It just got a little too free. Going 150 straight, that's going to happen. We'll just have to regroup and tighten up the car a little bit."﻿
Davis finished fourth after leading the first 31 laps, with Brandon Barker rounding out the top five.
The PASS Super Late Models will be back in action on Saturday, March 15 for the Easter Bunny 150 at Hickory. Qualifying begins at 4 p.m. ET, with feature racing at 5 p.m. ET.
