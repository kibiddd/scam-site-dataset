Music Program (1946-1950)
Created as a program to promote Lightcrust Dough Flour, The Lightcrust Doughboys played mighty fine western swing and 1940s era country music. Featured in the Country Music Hall of Fame, The Doughboys would dress up like bakers with white uniforms and poofy hats, and tour around promoting their flour. Forming their group in 1929, the Lightcrust Doughboys went through many different musician changes. Two men who started the group were well known in western swing circles, Bob Wills and Milton Brown.

W. Lee "Pappy O'Daniel originally managed the Lightcrust Doughboys. A much hated figure in ythe group, Pappy disliked the hillbilly music and was overbearing and frustrating to work with.
In 1935, Pappy was fired as manager and formed a new band, Pat O'Daniel and his Hillbilly Boys, who went on to have their own old time radio show. The Lightcrust Doughboys, like the Hillbilly Boys, joked around, hooted, and hollered between songs.

After touring for many years, they broadcast up until 1942 when many members went off to war. In 1946, they began broadcasting again until 1950. So slip on that ten gallon hat and get those boots a scootin' because the Lightcrust Doughboys are on the air.
