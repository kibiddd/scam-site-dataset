Description
USS La Salle AP 102
World War II Cruise Book
Bring the Cruise Book to Life with this Multimedia Presentation
This CD will Exceed your Expectations
A great part of Naval history.
You would be purchasing the USS La Salle cruise book during World War II. Each page has been placed on a CD for years of enjoyable computer viewing. The CD comes in a plastic sleeve with a custom label. Every page has been enhanced and is readable. Rare cruise books like this sell for a hundred dollars or more when buying the actual hard copy if you can find one for sale.
This would make a great gift for yourself or someone you know who may have served aboard her. Usually only ONE person in the family has the original book. The CD makes it possible for other family members to have a copy also. You will not be disappointed we guarantee it.
Some of the items in this book are as follows:
Letter from the captain
Divisional group photos with names
Lucky Lou comes stateside.
Crew activity photos.
Plus, much more
Over 47 pictures and the ships story told on 30 pages.
Once you view this CD you will know what life was like on this Transport during World War II.
Additional Bonus:
22 Minute Audio "American Radio Mobilizes the Homefront" WWII (National Archives)
22 Minute Audio "Allied Turncoats Broadcast for the Axis Powers" WWII (National Archives)
20 Minute Audio of a "1967 Equator Crossing" (Not this ship but the Ceremony is Traditional)
6 Minute Audio of "Sounds of Boot Camp" in the late 50's early 60's
Other Interesting Items Include:25 Hi Res Images of the "World War Two Memorial" in Washington DC
The Oath of Enlistment
The Sailors Creed
Core Values of the United States Navy
Military Code of Conduct
Navy Terminology Origins (8 Pages)
Examples: Scuttlebutt, Chewing the Fat, Devil to Pay,

Personal Comment from "Navyboy63"
If your loved one is still with us, they might consider this to be a priceless gift. Statistics show that only 25-35% of sailors purchased their own cruise book. Many probably wished they would have. It's a nice way to show them that you care about their past and appreciate the sacrifice they and many others made for you and the FREEDOM of our country.
If you have any questions, please send us an E-mail prior to purchasing.
Check our feedback. Customers who have purchased these CD's have been very pleased with the product.
Thanks for your Interest!
This CD is for your personal use only
