A toast to a great idea that capitalizes on Kansas City's theme song: The Mutual Musicians Foundation is stepping up their game when it comes to marketing and promoting all of the great things they do and their historical significance in Kansas City and the world Jazz scene.
To wit . . .
TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST IMAGES OF THE "KANSAS CITY BOTTLE OF WINE" FROM THE MUTUAL MUSICIANS FOUNDATION!!!
This idea really is a ingenious given that The Mutual Musicians Foundation has exclusive rights to a very valuable and iconic collection of photos from throughout the history of Jazz. And the reference to the Wilbert Harrison is an added bonus.
Every year the "Kansas City Bottle Of Wine" will feature a new photo from their collection so that every year the bottle will become a collector's item.
This year's stock will retail for around $35 and is available at the Mutual Musicians Foundation and coming soon to select stores.
The "Kansas City Bottle Of Wine" is a collaboration with Amigoni Urban Winery located in Kansas City, Missouri as well.
"We wanted to find a real local partner to make this project as authentic as possible," Anita J. Dixon, Vice President of the Mutual Musicians Foundation said. "Just like the song says, in every respect this is true Kansas City bottle of wine."
This ideas comes just in time for The Mutual Musicians Foundation. In 2006, it was estimated that the building needed at least $300k worth of work. Now, the staff believes that at least $500,000 will be required to renovate the building.
In that respect, this marketing effort is a neat way for Jazz patrons to purchase a piece of local music history and support one of Kansas City's most beloved institutions.
Stay tuned for more information on the effort to keep the Mutual Musicians Foundation afloat . . .
