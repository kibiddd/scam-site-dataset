The church that Bourgeoys founded in Montreal is very beautiful and the museum dedicated to her is worth a visit. This book is geared towards all age levels. It is not pitched too low or too high and offers a general life history of St. Marguerite. There are some good illustrations. Keep in mind, however, it is not a general history of the times, just a biography.diverse-and-women-authors history-canada montreal-and-quebec ...more1 likeLike CommentGenevieve  Paquette1,041 reviews21 followersFollowFollowDecember 19, 2020A nice, relatively thorough little hagiography. It was a quick, interesting read that, not going to lie, had me misting up at a couple of points. I also appreciated that they included a lot of historical artwork and other images. I found it useful in helping me to understand the history and mission of the CNDs.1 likeLike CommentTamaraAuthor 5 books187 followersFollowFollowJuly 19, 2018Loved this little biography of a seventeenth century Woman religious leaderdissertation-readingLike Commentdaph ୨୧73 reviews4 followersFollowFollowReadMay 23, 2024read this for my job Like CommentDisplaying 1 - 4 of 4 reviewsJoin the discussionAdda quoteStarta discussionAska questionCan't find what you're looking for?Get help and learn more about the design.Help centerCompanyAbout usCareersTermsPrivacyInterest Based AdsAd PreferencesHelpWork With UsAuthorsAdvertiseAuthors & ads blogConnect© 2025 Goodreads, Inc.
