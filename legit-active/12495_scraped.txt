Willis was looking for voice actors and asked her if she knew anyone with a weird voice, and she recommended Snyder. His first "audition" was leaving a drunken, abusive, message on Dave Willis' voice mail at 3 am. Willis loved it but accidentally erased the recording and asked him to re-record it, which he did, but sober this time. Willis wasn't as keen on the second recording so he asked him to do it like he did the first time. Snyder dutifully went out with some friends, got drunk, and left another 3 am message. He was given the job.QuotesMeatwad: I don't have any real dolls, I prefer to use my infinite imagination... cause I ain't got no damn money.ConnectionsEdited into Creative Continuity: Adult Swim (2015)SoundtracksAqua Teen Hunger Force ThemeWritten and Performed by Schoolly D(theme song: seasons 1-7)User reviews91ReviewFeatured reviewOh, this is freakin' great!This is the reason I watch "Adult Swim" every week, on the chance that ATHF are in the line-up. An incompetent but egotistical shake, a super intelligent box of fries and a happy-go-lucky meatball spend the day outwitting the most incompetent gang of villains this side of the Amoeba Boys and tormenting their loser neighbor to the point where you can actually feel sorry for the poor, no class, unemployable, grouchy slob.Shake is similar to at least one person who works with all of us. He's a bully, he's lazy, he's selfish, he's pathetic at what he does, but he feels he's the leader just because he says he is. Frylock is the guy at the office or the plant who actually DOES know what he's doing and saves the day without any desire for the responsibility or glory of leadership. Meatwad is the guy who tries his best, usually doesn't hit the mark perfectly and is just fun to have around.Full-length movie anyone?
