He worked for seven years in the 1960s under the direction of Laurence Olivier at the National Theatre. He was also a prolific actor on screen, usually seen in avuncular roles. He is probably best remembered for his BAFTA-nominated performance as Mr. Bennet in the BBC's acclaimed version of Pride and Prejudice (1995) and he made his final appearance in Gary Oldman's Churchill film Darkest Hour (2017). In his personal life, he was fond of wild orchids, golf, bridge and collecting books, and had a son, Angus Imrie, with actress Celia Imrie.BornFebruary 17, 1937DiedSeptember 28, 2017(80)BornFebruary 17, 1937DiedSeptember 28, 2017(80)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
