2025-2026 FAFSA NOW AVAILABLE!
The U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that the Federal Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form is now available for students to complete and submit, more than a week ahead of the
planned release date of December 1. The Missouri Department of Higher Education &
Workforce Development (MDHEWD) encourages students to file their FAFSA before February
3, 2025 to be considered for the most financial aid available.
Click on this link: FAFSA application to get to the FAFSA page.  Once you are there, you will have the option of completing
the current year's FAFSA (2024-25, for Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025 semesters)
or next year's (2025-26, for Fall 2025, Spring 2026, and Summer 2026 semesters) OR
you can make a correction to an existing 2024-2025 FAFSA also.  You (and your parents, if applicable) can apply for the FSA ID now, so completing that step early can make your FAFSA filing go more smoothly as
you (and your parents) will need to provide consent to allow tax information to be
added to your FAFSA.
Also, please visit UCM's 2025-2026 FAFSA Updates page or the Department of Education's Updates page for the latest information.
