Ellen Degeneres is Officially CANCELLED After This Happened...
In today’s video, join us as we show you the reasons why Ellen DeGeneres is cancelled. DeGeneres is no doubt one of the beloved TV hosts who helped pave the way for acceptance of oneself in the LGBTQ community and always ends each episode of her show by reminding her audience to be kind to one another. But behind her beaming smile and contagious energy, there may be a lot of offensive things she has done in the past.
This year, Ellen DeGeneres has faced a lot of backlash including a YouTuber's worst experience as a guest on the show and the way Ellen treats her employees. These are just some of the backlash she has gotten but there are plenty more. Be sure to watch the whole video because your opinion on the talk show host might change you. For the better. In addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. We’ll see you in the next video!
