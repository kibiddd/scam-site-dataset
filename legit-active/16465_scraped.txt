No doubt that JR Rider is best known for pioneering the between-the-legs dunk and winning the ’94 NBA SLAM Dunk Contest. Beyond his freakish jumping ability, JR could shoot the 3-ball and score at will as a youngster in the NBA. He was named to the All-Rookie First Team in ’94 and averaged 20 pts/game with Minnesota in his Sophomore season. While off-court issues plagued him for most of his career, he’s still remembered as one of the most acrobatic athletes the NBA has ever seen. Over 563 games from ’93-02, Rider averaged 16.7 pts, 3.8 rbs, and 2.7 asts. Shout out to Yinka Dare for the Mix.
