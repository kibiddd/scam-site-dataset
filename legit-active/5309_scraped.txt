MLB Free Agents 2012: 5 Players Cincinnati Reds Should TargetBleacher ReportNBAWorld FootballNHLMLBMMA03:32Featured VideoWhy Braves Will Win NL East üìùPreviousNextMLBMLB Free Agents 2012: 5 Players Cincinnati Reds Should TargetScott L. HutchinsonJun 7, 2018After winning the NL Central and earning a playoff berth in 2010, the Cincinnati Reds' 2011 campaign was awfully disappointing.¬†Not only did Cincinnati fail to make the postseason, they also had to watch bitter rival St. Louis hoist the World Series trophy.All is not lost, though,¬†Reds fans. Cincinnati has a chance to rebuild this offseason and get back to their 2010 form.Here are five free agents they should target to do just that.David Aardsma: Closing Pitcher1 of 5Considering Francisco Cordero is no longer a Red and Cuban sensation Aroldis Chapman will be starting in 2012, Cincinnati is in need of a quality closer.David Aardsma is never going to be Mariano Rivera, but he has recorded 268 strikeouts and 69 saves in his young career.He's a functional closer at the very least, and after spending the past few seasons battling injuries in Seattle, a change of scenery along with a clean bill of health could do Aardsma some good.Clint Barmes: 2B/SS2 of 5Edgar Renteria is on his way out and Brandon Phillips is getting older. The Reds could now use a solid utility infielder to back up both Phillips and shortstop Zack Cozart.Clint Barmes is a veteran who has some pop at the plate, and he could likely be signed inexpensively, given his age.He could also provide several Cincinnati starters with much-needed rest and be a valuable asset as the Reds attempt to climb back into the playoff picture.Paul Maholm: Starting Pitcher3 of 5While his record wasn't¬†particularly¬†impressive last season, Pittsburgh's Paul Maholm could actually be a great fit in Cincinnati's starting rotation.Great American Ballpark is one of the most homer-friendly ballparks in MLB, and Maholm is one of the league's best ground-ball pitchers.In other words, he could keep the ball out of the seats and keep opponents from tacking up huge innings.He would make a great fifth starter in Cincy and provide a veteran presence in the clubhouse.TOP NEWSMLB Predictions 2025: Updated Win-Loss Projections for Every TeamBleacher Report1dThe 2025 Worst-Case Scenarios for Every MLB TeamBleacher Report2dTop MLB Prospects Making a Case for a 2025 Opening Day Roster SpotBleacher Report3dArthur Rhodes: Relief Pitcher4 of 5Should Arthur Rhodes continue his playing career after winning the World Series with St. Louis, Cincinnati would likely welcome him back with open arms.Even at the age of 42, Rhodes is still a premier left-handed reliever. He would be a great addition to the Cincinnati bullpen, just as he was from 2009-2010.The Reds' pitching staff seems to be getting younger and younger each year, and it could certainly use a veteran presence like Rhodes.Dontrelle Willis: Starting Pitcher5 of 5If the Reds fail to bring in a top-tier starting pitcher, why not bring back the D-Train?Willis actually pitched much better this season than his 1-6 record suggests, and he looked as sharp as he has in a long while.He may never get back the dominant stuff he had in his younger days, but he still has serious potential and could be used as a spot starter if nothing else.03:32 Why Braves Will Win NL East üìùTOP NEWSNew Win-Loss Projections üîÆBleacher Report1dWorst-Case Scenarios in 2025 üìâBleacher Report2dMLB Prospects Making Case for Roster SpotsBleacher Report3dYankees to Sign LHP YarbroughBleacher Report1dYanks Prospect‚Äôs Call to Mom ü•πBleacher Report2dTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢2dMLB Opening Day 2025: Betting Lines, Odds Revealed for All Matchups on ScheduleBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMLB Power Rankings: Where All 30 Teams Stand Ahead of 2025 Opening DayBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dFantasy Baseball Sleepers 2025: Best Hitting and Pitching Prospects to Draft Best hitting and pitching prospects to draft üì≤Bleacher Report‚Ä¢2dJuan Soto Says Yankees Were 'No. 1' Early in MLB FA, Had Concerns About NYY's FutureBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dVideo: Yankees' Aaron Boone Says He Told Juan Soto He Looks 'Terrible' in Mets UniformTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢2dMLB Opening Day 2025: Betting Lines, Odds Revealed for All Matchups on ScheduleBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dMLB Power Rankings: Where All 30 Teams Stand Ahead of 2025 Opening DayBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dFantasy Baseball Sleepers 2025: Best Hitting and Pitching Prospects to Draft Best hitting and pitching prospects to draft üì≤Bleacher Report‚Ä¢2dJuan Soto Says Yankees Were 'No. 1' Early in MLB FA, Had Concerns About NYY's FutureBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dVideo: Yankees' Aaron Boone Says He Told Juan Soto He Looks 'Terrible' in Mets UniformBleacher ReportAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersSitemapCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyCookie PreferencesTerms Of UseB/R Sports on MAXB/R Creators ProgramCopyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
