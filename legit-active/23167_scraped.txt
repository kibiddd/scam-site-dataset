Is the Avila subdivision a good place to relocate to? I am a doctor relocating from Minnesota. I'm just a curious about the subdivision. I understand that it is a gated community.

One of the most upscale neighborhoods in Tampa.  Only downside would be the heavy traffic on Dale Mabry if you have to travel during rush hour.
It is gated and has a beautiful golf course

Avila is a resort style neighborhood of exclusive residences in Northwest Hillsborough County. Amenities include golf, tennis, pool, fitness, dining, and clubhouse. The community is both guarded and gated. Several of Tampa's celebrities & sports figures have homes there (Tony Dungy, Vince Naimoli). It's also very convenient to the hospitals near the University of South Florida.

Two thumbs up...
Highly recommend...always lots going on at the clubhouse.  But can be very private, as well.  Also, a great investment.  You will never lose money buying a home in Avila!  There are zero lot line homes form the 800's thru 5 million.  Good luck w/ your home search.  Welcome to Tampa!

Avila is, in my opinion, THE luxury community in Tampa.  Absolutely gorgeous.

This is one of the best guarded communities in Tampa and privacy is well kept for home owners. Really beautiful to live there and very close to the airport, interstate, etc.
For any one who can afford it this is a great community to live.

800k+ for zero lot lines? I don't see value in zero lot line.
Avila is like Cheval except it is a lot closer to the bad areas of town cross 41 going east.  I dont like its surroundings. But it makes a great bubble for rich people. Usually Bucs football players live there.
