Greatest Films
- by Year: One
way to look at films is to concentrate on  each individual
year's releases. It's a good method to recognize the flow and
the trends of films, to see those that performed best, and
to look at those that came to the forefront or were critically
important.
Many of the entries have short or brief capsule
summaries, and some provide links to much longer essays. Select
an individual year within a decade for a listing of the greatest
films for that particular year. Each of the films is labeled
with Film
Genre icons, designating whether it was a drama, comedy,
adventure film, horror film, or a hybrid combination.
