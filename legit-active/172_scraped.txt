Lyrics:
The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Victory
As the King of Kings was questioned by Pilate long agoHe declared
His kingdom different not of this worldA kingdom for the side of truth
like none has ever beenPilate asked, What is truth?He was standing
right in front of him
Truth was standing right in front of himAs plain as anything could
ever beTruth was standing right in front of himHe was standing
there for all the world to seeThe Way, The Truth, the Life, the
Victory
Stephen, first beloved martyr, gave up his life for HimBeing stoned
by angry people filled with revengeWhere was God when all this
happened?Stephen looked into the sky, he was never aloneGod was
standing right in front of him
Truth was standing right in front of himAs plain as anything could
ever beTruth was standing right in front of himRevealed to him for
comfort and to seeHe was standing there for his delivery
Now the quest for truth continues until this very dayBut the source
that we should seek is not of this worldA truth that is revealed by
God, the Spirit's made it clearIf you ask what is truth? He is
standing right in front of you
Truth is standing right in front of youAs plain as anything could
ever beTruth is standing right in front of youStanding there for
all eternityThe Way, the Truth, the Life, the Victory
He is standing right in front of youShowing love for open eyes to
seeJesus is standing right in front of youStanding there for He
will always beThe Son of Man, the Son of GodThe King of Kings, the
Lord of LordsThe Way, the Truth, the Life, the Victory
Scriptural Reference:
"'What is truth?' Pilate asked.  With this he went out again to
the Jews and said, 'I find no basis for a charge against him."  John
18:38"But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and
saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God."
Acts 7:55

Scriptural Reference:
"To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you
an example, that you should follow in his steps."  1 Peter
2:21"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through
the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we
profess.  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to
sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in
every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.  Let us then approach
the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find
grace to help us in our time of need."  Hebrews 4:14-16

Lyrics:
Somebody feels hopelessSomebody despairsSomebody walks a path
aloneWatching others walk around in pairsSomebody's in the street
nowSomebody's in doubtSomebody has no place to goSomebody
cries out saying
Abba, Father, take me higherAbba, Father, take me home
Somebody is hungrySomebody's in painSomebody sleeps alone in
fearSomebody's in shameSomebody needs a friend to lean
onSomebody's not thereSomebody's looking at the endSomebody's
in prayer, praying
Chorus:Abba, Father, take me higher[You're not alone (know
you're not)Somebody's there (you know we've got)The Lord to guide
our wayTo help us make it through the day]Abba, Father, take me

take us home, Father]
Abba, Father
Repeat Chorus (x2)
Take me homeTake me home, FatherFather please, take me
homeAbba, Father
Scriptural Reference:
"For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear,
but you received the Spirit of sonship.  And by him we cry, 'Abba,
Father.' The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's
children.  Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God
and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order
that we may also share in his glory."  Romans 8:15-17 (1-17 cited on
insert)"Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our
hearts, the Spirit woh calls out, 'Abba, Father.'"  Galatians 4:6

Begins

Lyrics:
To an aged man God spokeWords that sounded like a jokeSoon his
wife would bear a childA saying hard to reconcileSo he asked, can
this thing be?Can a nation spring from me?With a body grown so
oldIn a word this man was told
Chorus:Your life begins with GodYour love begins with
GodYour hopes and your dreamsAnd your plans begin with GodYour
life begins with GodYour love begins with GodYour hopes and your
dreamsAnd your plans begin with God, begin with God
From a valley full of bonesTo a man of God, well knownCame a
vision strange but trueMighty things the Lord would doHe would
breathe them back to lifeHis command caused them to riseLike the
nation He would raiseTo the glory of His praise
Repeat Chorus
I was standing on the edge of the worldHopelessly alone in the
darkIn the beginning all was empty and voidIn my mind, my soul, my
heart of heartsThe Creator came and moved in my lifeHe spoke and
turned my darkness to lightDay by day He's rearranging my waysHe's
my Lord, my God, my King
To a leper on his faceTo a woman's dark disgraceTo a prisoner's
empty nightTo a blind man's quest for sightTo a mother's boy lying
dead (you're not alone)To a beggar's plea for bread (you're not
alone)To a lame man's crippled bones (you're not alone)To a
stranger's journey home (you're going home)
Repeat Chorus
Begins with God (Begin with God, Begin with God)Begins with God
(Begin with God, Begin with God)Begins with God (Begin with God, Begin
with God)
Scriptural Reference:
"By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was
barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful
who had made the promise.  and so from this one man, and he as good
as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as
countless as the sand on the seashore." Hebrews 11:11-12 (insert cites all
of Hebrews 11)

foreversYou ought to be able to say Amen]
All I need
Scriptural Reference:
"So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we
drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.  But seek
first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given
to you as well.  Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow
will worry about itself.  Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Matthew 6:31-34
