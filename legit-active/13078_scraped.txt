Dispite her age, the Bear underwent a refit and served as a patrol
vessel during WWII. She was retired in 1944. The Bear sank off

mother ships which would operate outside of the US 12 mile limit.
The McDougal was one of 33 destroyers that the US Navy lent to
the Coast Guard for this purpose. The McDougal was commissioned
