Home video
Home video is pre-recorded media that is either sold or rented or streamed for home cinema entertainment. The term originates from the VHS/Betamax era, when the predominant medium was videotape, but has carried over into current optical disc formats like DVD and Blu-ray Disc and, to a lesser extent, into methods of digital distribution such as Netflix.
The home video business distributes films, telemovies and television series in the form of videos in various formats to the public. These are either bought or rented, then watched privately from the comfort of home by consumers. Most theatrically released films are now released on digital media, both optical (DVD or Blu-ray) and download-based, replacing the largely obsolete VHS (Video Home System) medium. The VCD format remains popular in Asia, though DVDs are gradually gaining popularity.
History
Prior to the arrival of home video as a popular medium in the late 1970s, most feature films were essentially inaccessible to the public after their original theatrical runs were over. Some very popular films were given occasional theatrical re-releases, some could be seen in urban revival houses and the screening rooms of a handful of archives and museums, and beginning in the 1950s most could be expected to turn up on television eventually, but interrupted by commercials and very possibly at an inconvenient or impossible viewing time. During this era, it was also the norm that television programs could only be viewed at the time of broadcast. Viewers were accustomed to the fact that there was no normal way to record TV shows at home and watch them whenever desired. Many observed that such a capability would be desirable.

Home Video (band)
'Home Video is an American electronic rock band from Brooklyn, New York. The group is composed of David Gross (keyboard/bass/sequencer) and Collin Ruffino (vocals/guitar), with live shows featuring Jim Orso on drums.
History
Originally from New Orleans, David Gross and Collin Ruffino began playing music under the name Home Video name when they both moved to New York. It was there that they were discovered by Warp Records, who put out the band's first two releases  in 2004, the That You Might 10 inch and the Citizen EP, which garnered the attention of such outlets as BBC Radio 1, NME and Rolling Stone. In 2006, Defend Music released the band's first full-length, No Certain Night or Morning, accompanying by a 12 inch for the single "Penguin," which included a remix by DFA Records's Tim Goldsworthy. From this album, DJ Sasha later picked two songs to remix for Invol2ver, which also included reworked songs from Ladytron, M83, and Apparat. Following this release, in 2009 the band released the It Will Be Ok EP. Outside of recording, the band has toured with Blonde Redhead, Colder, Yeasayer and has opened up for acts such as Justice, Flying Lotus, Radio 4 and Pinback. Additionally, the band has produced remixes for Bang Gang ("The World is Gray"), Modwheelmood ("Going Nowhere") and Faunts ("Explain").
