Walking on the Clouds), written by soap opera writing newcomer Euclydes Marinho brings back the classic way of comedy making.With the intuit of rescuing the charm of a modern but nevertheless romantic city of Rio de Janeiro, this show does it well.As the title suggests this is the light and comic story of Otávio Montana, brilliantly played by Marco Nanini, a man who spent the last 18 years in a coma, with a memory only dating back to 1968. When Otávio wakes up from 18 years of sleep his three daughters have grown up, Júlia (Déborah Bloch) the oldest and now a famous journalist, Bete (Vivianne Pasmanter) an aspiring young model and Celi (Mariana Ximenes) a novice who wants to someday become a nun. The story revolves around Otávio's perception of the new world around him and Chico Mota's (Marcos Palmeira) quest to discover the murderer of Otávio's father Gregório who Otávio doesn't remember. As the main suspect, the corrupted San Marino (Cláudio Marzo) stands out as Otávio's adopted brother who now manages the family business and will do anything to yank secrets out of Otávio's past including a secret bank account his father, Gregório, had in Switzerland, not only that but San Marino had an affair with Otávio's beloved wife, the now passed away Eva.For 18 years, Otávio Montana was absent from the world, until a medical miracle allowed for his recovery. The neurologist Lídia Libion (Helena Ranaldi), who for many years worked in London on cases such as his, of lethargic sleep - also known as "the tiredness disease"- makes him come back to life, which has been stopped for so long. The confusions and surprises that await Otávio Montana, in his encounter with his family, are shown with emotion and lots of humor on Andando nas Nuvens, Globo's seven o' clock drama, by Euclydes Marinho, Elisabeth Jhin, Vinícius Vianna and Letícia Dornelles. The show is directed by Denis Carvalho, Ary Coslov and José Luiz Villamarin.With a stellar cast including critically acclaimed actors like Marcos Palmeira, Marco Nanini, Déborah Bloch, Nicette Bruno, Júlia Lemmertz, Vivianne Pasmanter, Cláudio Marzo, Suzana Vieira, Hugo Carvana, Milton Gonçalves, Marcello Novaes, Isabela Garcia, Otávio Augusto, Eliane Giardini and the newcomers Caio Blat, Fernanda Souza and Mariana Ximenes, this show is the certainty of an astonishingly funny, comedic and dramatic masterpiece by Brazil's greatest network Globo TV.Overall this is an awesome show, with a great story to tell with a lot of humor as well as dramatic situations, this is a don't miss fling.Check out Andando nas Nuvens.SMarti-3Jul 7, 1999PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateMarch 22, 1999 (Brazil)Country of originBrazilLanguagePortugueseAlso known asWalking the CloudsProduction companyRede Globo de TelevisãoSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime50 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Andando Nas Nuvens (1999) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
