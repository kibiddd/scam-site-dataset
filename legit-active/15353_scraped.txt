What’s new?
We're Celebrating……
In 2025 RMVC reaches its 30th year of making wonderful music through song and through entertaining our fabulous audiences far and wide. All of our great Choir members absolutely love what we do and how we do it, which is why after 30 years yes, we will be waving the flag and getting ready for a fantastic start to the next 30 years!  We’ll let you know about our planned celebratory concerts and who knows we may just have some surprises….
See you there.
