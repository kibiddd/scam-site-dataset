History of the awards
Since its inception in 1960 the Australian of the Year Awards have provided a focal point for Australia Day celebrations and a forum for the recognition of outstanding achievement.
The official announcement on 25 January is broadcast live to the nation on ABC and iView.
The awards today
Each year our nation celebrates the achievements and contributions of eminent Australians through the Australian of the Year Awards by profiling leading citizens who are role models for us all. They inspire us through their achievements and challenge us to make our own contribution to creating a better Australia.
The Awards honour an exceptional group of highly-respected Australians who ignite discussion and change on issues of national importance.
The Australian of the Year Awards provide everyone with the opportunity to recognise any Australian who makes them proud.
