The menu below provides a detailed history of this unit from the
official
Operational Reports obtained from the National Archives.  It
includes
an official report of the training of the unit during 1942 and some
stories
of combat as told by my Dad and his friend, Lt. Sullivan, at a reunion
of this unit.
Brief
History
The 328th Field Artillery
Battalion
is one of the 3 artillery units that made up the artillery support of
the
85th Custer Division. The 328th Field Artillery(or FA) Battalion
trained
at Camp Shelby, MS and entered combat in May 1944 with the Custer
Division.
They participated in capture of Rome, attack of the Gothic Line, heavy
fighting in the Appenine Mountains, crossing of the Po River and drive
to the Alps.
The 85th
Division consisted
of 328th, 329th, 403rd and 910th FA Battalions. A typical Battalion
consisted
of 3 batteries, each containing four 105mm howitzers.  The 403FA
Battalion was a medium battery that fired
155mm Howitzers. Each battery was sighted in together and could fire at
same targets simultaneously after initial ranging shot. In July of
1944,
two additional guns were added to the battery.  Later, a group of
self-propelled artillery was designated as Battery
"D" of 328th FA Battalion.
Also, generally, one
artillery
battalion was assigned to one infantry regiment and one battery was
assigned
to a specific infantry battalion (or 4 infantry companies). Thus, 328th
FA was assigned to support the 337th Infantry Regiment and Battery B
was
assigned to support 2nd Battalion of that Regiment. However, due to the
fluidity of the battle command, this changed a lot as the groups
rotated
through reserve status.

Unit
Insignia
328th Field Artillery Battalion
Ram's Horn
13 shells:   3+2+8  or 8+5
Motto:  " WE ARE READY "
The DUI pin
for the 328th Field Artillery was a brass pin with red enamel.
The
pin has a band forming an inverted "V", which contained 13
shells.
Below this was a rams' horn and the motto: "WE ARE READY".
Explanation of
pin:
Red is the traditional color for the artillery. The ram's horn refers
to
the Battle of Little Big Horn and General George Custer, which ties
this
unit to the 85th 'Custer' Division that was formed at Camp Custer,
Michigan
during WW1.  The 13 shells can represent both the 85th Division
and
the 328th FA Battalion.  By summing the number  3+2+8 or the
number 8+5, the total will still add up to 13.
DUI Pin of the 328FA pin.   This one is
made of brass and
the Ram's Horn is gold colored.
The pin attaches with a horizontal pin with
clasp.  I have seen
a version that has the screw & nut
attachment.
Another
example of the 328FA pin that is typical for a pre-war
design.  This DUI is a little different style with curved side to shield
and
Horn
is reversed.  It does not have a banner under the
shield
with the motto.
Three different styles were produced.
I'm trying to research
this pin to find out when it was made and when(or if) it was
worn by the military.
A
posed photo of PFC Finnis Treadway,
Battery B, of Moulton, AL.  This photo was taken with his
brother
but I have edited him out of the picture.
PFC
Treadway is wearing a 328 FA DUI pin on only one of his lower
lapels.
The round pins on the upper lapel are the "US" & artillery collar
devices.  A marksmanship badge is pinned to his pocket flap.
This is
the only
photo record that I have seen of a soldier wearing the 328FA DUI
pin.
PFC
Treadway is not wearing the DUI correctly.  The DUI
pin is optional, but if worn, then one is centered on each
lower
lapel.  The DUI in the photo is too low and only one is shown. It
may also be worn on the overseas cap, in place of the "US" disc.
My guess
is that
he was wearing the DUI pin on his overseas cap.  When he posed for
this photo with his visor cap, he quickly decided to take the pin off
of
his overseas cap and temporarily pin it to his uniform.

grandson of Finnis
Treadway.  Matt is currently a cadet at the Merchant
Marine Academy in NY---when he is not at sea.
A
nice photo of Sgt Condon E. Davis,
Battery B, of Decatur TN.  In this photo, Sergeant
Davis is wearing the dress uniform with the
rank of Sergeant and the 328FA DUI pins on his lower lapels.  He
is wearing the rank of Sergeant but no campaign ribbons.  This is
the only photo that I
have seen of a soldier wearing these DUI's.
The photo is not clear enough to see details of the pin, except
the inverted chevron.  Sgt
Davis was a member of the 328FA and he was
mentioned in Sgt. Cole's photo album.
This photo was probably taken at his last visit to his home  in November 1943  before the 85th Division
shipped out for Europe.

Flag
of the 328th Field
Artillery
Battalion
Flag
is made of a light silk material with gold fringe.  It contains
the
Coat of Arms of the 328FA in the center and the motto on a banner
clenched
in the mouth of the eagle.  Above is the Minute Man statue that
denotes
a National Guard unit.
The story
behind this flag is amazing.  Flags such as this were issued to
rifle
companies, artillery battalions, quartermaster companies and other
units.
When the unit was deactivated, the flags were usually retired and
placed in
storage.   Some may have made their way to a muesum or
returned
to the Quarter Master Museum at Fort Lee, VA.  In most cases, the
location of many flags is probably unknown to anyone in the Army.
Sgt.
Keane was a member of Battery A of the 328FA.  After the
war
was over, he and about 10 other men were selected to take a 10-day
vacation
to Nice, France. When they returned, they found that the 328FA and the
85th Division had shipped out for home in late August 1945.
Eventually, Sgt.
Keane caught a ship home and arrived in Virginia.
When they
disembarked off the ship, they entered a large warehouse where
everything
on the ships had been unloaded.  Soldiers were dumping their old
uniforms
and boots as well as crates of other items from the other ships docked
in the port.  Sgt. Keane spotted the
both flags of the 328FA lying on the floor.  One was the artillery
flag shown above and the other was the National Flag.  He
retrieved
the flags and packed them away in his duffle bag.
