1.
Which of the following group music experiences would Best develop a client's social skills?
A.
Music video production
B.
Music-assisted relaxation
C.
Keyboard lessons
D.
Computer-generated composition
Correct Answer
A. Music video production
ExplanationMusic video production would best develop a client's social skills because it involves collaboration and teamwork. In order to create a music video, individuals need to work together, communicate effectively, and coordinate their efforts. This process allows clients to interact with others, express their ideas, and learn how to work in a group setting. Additionally, music video production often involves performing and presenting in front of others, which can help clients build confidence and improve their social skills further.

During a music therapy assessment, a client with late-stage dementia changed her facial expression several times, hummed parts of a familiar melody, made eye contact with the therapist, and attempted to play a hand drum.  She was unresponsive to other stimuli in the environment.  Which of the following would be the Best treatment recommendation for this client?
A.
Individual sessions emphasizing reality orientation
B.
Individual sessions emphasizing sensory awareness and stimulation
C.
A small rhythm group emphasizing reminiscence and life review
D.
A music appreciation group emphasizing reminiscence and life review
Correct Answer
B. Individual sessions emphasizing sensory awareness and stimulation
ExplanationBased on the client's behavior during the music therapy assessment, it can be inferred that she is showing engagement and responsiveness specifically to the music-related stimuli. This suggests that individual sessions emphasizing sensory awareness and stimulation would be the best treatment recommendation for this client. This approach would capitalize on her ability to connect with music, using it as a means to stimulate her senses and promote engagement and interaction.

A song in the key of C needs to be transposed to the key of Eb.  Using first position fingering in the key of C, the therapist needs to place the capo on the
A.
2nd fret.
B.
7th fret.
C.
5th fret.
D.
3rd fret.
Correct Answer
D. 3rd fret.
ExplanationTo transpose a song from the key of C to the key of Eb, the therapist needs to place the capo on the 3rd fret. This is because when the capo is placed on the 3rd fret, it effectively raises the pitch of all the open strings by three half steps. By doing so, the therapist can play the same chord shapes and patterns as they would in the key of C, but the actual sound produced will be in the key of Eb.
