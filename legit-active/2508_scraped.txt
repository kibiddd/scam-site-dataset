I think Drew Brees is well on his way to becoming the NFL's favorite son.  The national recognition he is getting is putting our Saints even more on the map after the entire team did it in the Super Bowl.

This guy knows how to have fun.  He can be so focused and yet relaxed.   I'm sure he will be recognized for his leadership by all of America.......except for the media of course.......oh wait, they'll be kissing his butt now.  What was I thinking?
