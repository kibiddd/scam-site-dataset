Case study
iA Financial Group
iA Financial Group, one of Canada’s largest insurance and wealth groups, increased the focus on its core mission and investment activities by entrusting Canderel with the operational management, leasing and maintenance of its entire Quebec portfolio—4.5M sf of real estate assets across 16 properties in Montreal and Quebec, including heritage buildings.
Within the first year, Canderel:
Decreased operating costs by 14% compared to budget
Leased over 466,106 sf (+10% of the overall 4.5M sf portfolio)
Designed and built out three Pronto Suites
Launched new tenant engagement activities with a focus on health and wellness
Case study
Giant Tiger
Giant Tiger mandated Canderel to lead a new head office project on its 450,000 sf industrial grounds in Ottawa. Addressing the challenge of building on a site with limited available space, Canderel creatively reconfigured an existing facility and orchestrated the demolition of surrounding areas to accommodate the new office tower.
As Giant Tiger’s eyes and ears, we oversaw the entire design and construction process, assembling a team of architects and engineers, along with other specialty consultants. Following successful delivery, Canderel also took on the mandate of property management services for the new headquarters.
Wrapped floor to ceiling in glass, the four-storey office tower consists of two wings connected by an atrium. The new building offers 50,000 sf of usable space, a full-service cafeteria and a workout facility.
Case study
Bentall Centre
Vancouver’s Bentall Centre was facing above-average vacancy—13.3% compared to the Vancouver ‘A’ market’s average 10.2%—when Canderel stepped in as a third-party manager.
In a short three-year span, we leased and renewed over 700,000 sf at this premier office complex, bringing in 62 new leases and completing 100+ leasing transactions overall. The average net rent at Bentall Centre increased substantially, and vacancy dropped by 1.3%.
Community. Sustainability. Inclusion.
We’re invested in creating value while keeping true to our core values. Recently, several initiatives contributed to the realignment of Canderel’s ESG pillars relative to our guiding principles.
