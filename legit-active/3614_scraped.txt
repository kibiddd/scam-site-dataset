Domaine Lafage Cote de Est Blanc

Check out Joe's Wine of the Week: Domaine Lafage Cote de Est Blanc. This wine is a lively blend of old vine Grenache Blanc with Chardonnay and Rolle. Both floral and aromatic, it is a delicious white that pairs extremely well with seafood, especially fish dishes with lemon sauce. Stop by this week and grab a bottle while supplies last.
All of Joe’s wines have been hand selected and tasted by Joe and his wine loving team! We hope you love them as much as we do.
