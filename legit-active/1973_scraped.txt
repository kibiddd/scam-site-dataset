Ford F-Series
The Ford F-Series is a series of full-size pickup trucks from Ford which has been sold continuously since 1948. The most popular variant of the F-Series is the F-150. It has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States for the past 32 years, and the best-selling pickup for 43 years, and the best selling vehicle in Canada. In the tenth generation of the F-series, the F-250 and F-350 changed body style in 1998 and joined the Super Duty series.
During the post-World War II era, smaller Canadian towns had access to either a Ford dealer or a Lincoln-Mercury-Meteor dealer, but not both; a Mercury-badged version was sold at Lincoln-Mercury-Meteor dealers there from 1946 to 1968. Other than the grilles, trim, and badging, these pickups are identical to their Ford counterparts.
First generation (1948–52)
The first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in 1948 as a replacement for the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, cab-over engine (COE), conventional truck, and school bus chassis body styles.
