This is likely the safest seat in Quebec for the Liberals since they may have a single digit seat total when this election is all said and done with.....

St. Laurent-Cartierville is of course a very safe Liberal riding, though I'm amazed that Stephane Dion even wants to run again.  He's quite the team player.  Still given the NDP surge in Quebec, I can imagine Dion stepping aside and Janine Krieber running here for the NDP next time around.

what ever happened to dion ? he went from liberal leader to virtually disappearing . i'm surprised he's running again i don't really understand why he decided to stay in federal politics after his leadership / coalition attempt disaster but its unlikely he loses this safe montreal liberal riding to any of the other candidates running. Qu'est-il arriv� � Dion? il est pass� de chef du Parti lib�ral � la quasi-disparition. Je suis surpris qu'il court encore, je ne comprends pas vraiment pourquoi il a d�cid� de surseoir � la politique f�d�rale apr�s son leadership en cas de catastrophe tentative de coalition, mais son peu probable qu'il perd ce coffre-fort lib�rale de la circonscription de Montr�al � l'un des autres candidats.

Dion's win in 2008 was the largest of any Liberal seat in Quebec.  This could actually be the new safest Liberal seat in QC.

Stephane Dion may have bombed nationally, but he is still well liked here.  Also as a mixed riding of Francophones, Allophones, and Anglophones, the Liberals are without question the party that appeals the best to this diverse riding

Dion has been under-whelming since he resigned as Liberal leader, so much so that I didn't expect him to run again.  That said I like him to win the election and re-sign during the next term.

I like your thinking, Nick. If EMay had half a brain, she'd be courting Dion as her candidate in St Laurent. He would actually have a fair chance of winning as a Greenie, all the more if EMay stepped aside as leader and allowed Dion to take her place at the helm. Nevertheless, I think Dion will be a good Liberal soldier and carry the red into yet another election. I think he hopes to redeem himself Joe Clark style, by getting into cabinet again and serving honourably.A final thought: Until today, it appeared that Coderre had a prett good handle on who was going to be a Quebec canadidate and who would be thrown under the bus, and  the rumours I had heard were that Dion, Patry and Folco were going to be pushed out. With Cauchon winning the battle over Outremont, Coderre likely does not have the same clout anymore, and should tread carefully. However, if he did purge Dion, I think you would see him run as a Green.

We couldn't agree more with Nick re: Dion winning even if he would run under another banner and with Smok re: Dion serving brilliantly in another's cabinet and repairing a tarnished image. Might we point to Stockwell Day being yet another example.

I predict this riding will go Liberal with one proviso. This riding will elect Dion in the next election if it can. That means if Dion does something unexpected like runs as an Indy, or even a Green, that he will hold on to the seat.At this time, however, suggestions of the above are quite silly indeed.

Only reason to weigh in on this Liberal slam dunk (they could run Earl Jones as a Grit, and he'd win in  a walk) is to offer the suggestion that perhaps Stephane Dion will emerge as a Joe Clark style figure in an eventual Liberal government.... for those born post 1988, Joe Clark served brian Mulroney's governments with great distinction, and in so doing repaired a tattered image.

The liberals will easy hold this riding even though Stephane Dion is its mp and he may or may not run again as he is not liberal leader anymore after the disasterous 2008 election. but i suspect he will run again and keep the house of commons interesting during question period if nothing else. Les lib�raux vont facilement organiser cette circonscription, m�me si St�phane Dion est son d�put� et il a mai ou mai ne pas courir de nouveau comme il n'est pas chef du Parti lib�ral plus apr�s la d�sastreuse �lectorale de 2008. mais je soup�onne qu'il recommence � courir et garder la Chambre des communes int�ressants au cours de la p�riode des questions, si rien d'autre.
