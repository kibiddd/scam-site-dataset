Delancey Seattle
delancey is an award-winning wood-fired pizza restaurant, serving our own long-fermented dough
made from Washington-grown wheat, locally and sustainably raised meats, and the highest quality
ingredients we can find. We work with local ranchers and farmers to bring in seasonal vegetables
and fruits, and we're proud to feature a carefully chosen selection of great local beers and
affordable wines from around the globe. As our staff likes to say, every night's a pizza party.
delancey is and will always be at
1415 NW 70th Street, Seattle.
You can call us at 206-838-1960 during business hours. You can email us at
delanceyseattle@gmail.com. We are primarily
a walk-in restaurant, but we take limited large-party reservations (6-11 people) online via
Tock.
We are open TuesdayâThursday 5-9pm, Friday 5-10pm, Saturday 4:30-10pm, Sunday 4:30-9pm, and closed Monday.
