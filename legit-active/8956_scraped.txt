Pilon International - The Pilons of Detroit, Michigan, USA
Pilons
of Detroit,
Michigan,
USA
In the middle of the 1800's, Thomas Pilon and his second wife Josephine
Levesque moved with their family from the Montreal, Quebec area to the
Detroit, Michigan area.  There, more children were born who would
form the basis for a large descendance.
In 1978, two of Thomas and Josephine's great-great-grandchildren produced
a detailed accounting of their ancestors' large family.  Titled: "Genealogy
and Family History of the Thomas Bernard Pilon Family" and published by
Corinthian Press, the precious book also provides valuable information
for other branches of the North American Pilon family.
We have, with the permission of Alberta Pilon McGovern and Robert Louis
Pilon, reproduced here some of the main elements of the Detroit, Michigan
family tree, up to the beginning of the XXth century.  A second source
of information which has contributed to this chart is the unpublished work
by Lionel Pesant "Répertoire de mariages Pilon, Hommes".
