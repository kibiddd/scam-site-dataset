Some bittersweet emotion about it if he's walking away with the Premier League trophy under his arms."But, we have been expecting it. This season Virgil [Van Dijk] stopped in the mixed zone and said he wanted to stay, [Mohamed] Salah's stopped and said we're far away from what he wants but that he does want to stay."Trent didn't do that - he stayed very quiet all season and articles came out saying he didn't want it being played out in the media but the opposite has happened - it's created more speculation than anyone wanted which has led us to where we are now with everyone saying he's agreed to go there."He's said so many times that he wanted to finish his career at Liverpool but something changed this year and he picked wanting to win the Ballon d'Or rather than achievements with Liverpool."I thought in that moment it changed a bit to the Trent Alexander-Arnold show - looking after himself and what he can achieve. I think he feels he can win the Ballon d'Or at Madrid but I don't think so - I think there's other players that can get there before him."As a Liverpool fan you're just devastated to see he's made that decision - but he has won everything there is to win at Liverpool."We are all living vicariously through Trent and now he has decided Madrid is the new dream - that's why we're all gutted."Listen to the interview here 'Asking for trouble' or 'club will survive'? Fans on out-of-contract triopublished at 16:11 25 March16:11 25 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesSpeculation around the futures of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk continues, so we gave you the hypothetical situation that all three leave at the end of their contracts and asked what would happen next.Here are some of your comments:Steven: Would it be worse than Fernando Torres, Steven Gerrard, Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush etc leaving? No. They are going to leave at some point. If they want to go, the club will survive.Andy: Will have to do some remarkable transfer business to retain the title for 2025-26 season. They will be lucky to get into the top six without those three.Ben: The club would be asking for trouble if that happened. You have three of the greatest players in the world, in form and on a hot streak of winning the league. How do you expect to win or challenge if you don't renew the contracts of the standout players of the season? Top scorer and easily the best finisher in the game, the best passer of the ball in the world and a tank of a defender who deals with most situations with absolute ease. Get those contracts drawn up, signed, sealed and delivered and let's continue bringing amazing times back to Anfield.Scott: Everyone leaves sooner or later. Once they're gone, I don't care. Time to move on and support the team and who is playing for the team. No-one is bigger than the club.Dan: If they all left on a free I would feel let down by the club. Salah and Van Dijk have both stated their desire to stay so how could the club then fail to come to an agreement with world-class players still performing at the highest level? It is a bit different with Alexander-Arnold. He hasn't stated his desire to stay so that's up to him. No hard feelings there.Rae: Whatever the outcome of the Van Dijk, Salah and Alexander-Arnold contracts, this surely reflects badly on Fenway Sports Group and the director of football. That all could leave the club for nothing is poor business strategy.David: It wouldn't be the end of the world if all three left. We have a ready-made replacement for Alexander-Arnold in Conor Bradley and, given the age of the other two, they will need replacing in the near future, even if it isn't this summer. Given how little was spent last summer, there should be decent money available to buy replacements.15:20 25 MarchReal in talks over finalising Alexander-Arnold signing, published at 15:20 25 MarchReal in talks over finalising Alexander-Arnold signingAttributionPremier LeagueComments2034Key trio leave - how would you feel and what happens next?published at 13:15 25 March13:15 25 MarchWith so much up in the air, we thought we'd paint a picture and explore what your reaction would be as a Liverpool fan if the below comes to fruition.It is 1 July 2025 and Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander Arnold have all left the club on free transfers after their contracts came to an end.So how would you feel?

We are now five months further on from that," Kent said."I think it is an open secret Trent will leave. I hope I am wrong, I really do, but I do expect that to happen. With Salah and Van Dijk, I think my heart says both stay and my head is just clouded. I like to think the club is doing everything they possibly can to keep them because why would you not?"It doesn't send the best message out to players coming to the club if you are fighting a battle to keep two of the best players in the world. We can argue all day about age and numbers, but there is no better centre-half in the world currently than Van Dijk - no-one will ever convince me there is. He is 33 and this is his best season for Liverpool ever. He is not regressing in any way."Right-back Alexander-Arnold could be heading to Real Madrid, while comments from Van Dijk and Salah have consistently suggested they are no closer to signing new deals."I know FSG and the club generally have a policy for players over the age of 30, but these are unique players," Kent added. "We are talking about the captain of the club [in Van Dijk] and one of the best players ever to play for the club in Mo Salah."If Salah signed a three-year contract and his numbers dropped off next season, the club could sell him to Saudi Arabia next summer for x amount of money."It would be a shame for Liverpool, if and when they do win the league, to go on and have a rebuild because it shouldn't be that way. It should be building and fine-tweaking. You shouldn't be doing open heart surgery on the team."What do you think will be the outcome of the contracts situation? Make your predictionListen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds'We need more from all of them' to not 'falter at the final hurdle'published at 11:45 25 March11:45 25 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your views on which players need to step up for Liverpool to help them over the line in the Premier League.Here are some of your comments:Scott: These past few weeks have really highlighted where we should have strengthened at the start of the season. As an opposing manager or fan, I'd not be overly worried about the impact our bench will have on a game if we're in need of finding something. Sides also seem to have found out our style of play and we don't have a plan B to try. I'd like to think we've done enough to win the league this season but next year we could end up middle of the pack, especially if Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah all leave. I hate to say it but we'd be one very average team then. It is not all doom and gloom, though. Dom Szoboszlai is up there with Salah and Alisson this season. A total transformation!Mark: Diogo Jota needs to raise his game. I'm a big fan but he has been lacklustre by his standards. Arne Slot should have played Wataru Endo against Newcastle. Our midfield was exhausted and, in turn, overrun - but hindsight is a wonderful thing. In the past few seasons, Liverpool have run out of steam by March. Slot now needs to use the squad wisely, including Endo and Federico Chiesa. Cody Gakpo will be a key player in the run-in.Rob: We need more goals from somewhere. It could be argued Salah is selfish, but his stats don't lie. More goals from central midfield, set-plays and the other "strikers" will see us over the line. I'd like to see wholesale changes to our attacking options in the summer and press on once more, because the rest of the league will not sit still.Find and follow your team on BBC SportRichard: We appear to be beginning to falter at the final hurdle. Salah went absent in both PSG ties and the cup final. Gakpo's form has dipped recently. Luis Diaz always looks lively, but doesn't really deliver as much as his activity should. Darwin Nunez is just a miss as a player. And Jota has not really refound his form post-injury. We need more from all them, although we are only in this potential league-winning position because of Mo. It seems like heads have already exited the building. It seems like Trent has already gone. It seems, now, like Mo and Virgil might also be leaving. It is hard to watch what appears to be the beginning of a gut-wrenching capitulation.Roger: Now is the time for Harvey Elliott and Chiesa. Both have been starved of action, but both have shown they can contribute defining moments. They can be the catalyst at a critical time when others are below par. Jarell Quansah is another who can make an impression, with some of our defenders injured or looking a bit jaded. What price on Nunez being an unlikely hero? Priceless! Everton will be tough after the international break, but a draw would not be the worst result.Who do Liverpool need more from to get over the line?published at 08:48 25 March08:48 25 MarchJordan ChamberlainFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesLiverpool's players have largely been exemplary this season. After all, the Reds are 12 points clear going into the final nine games and virtual shoo-ins for Premier League glory.However, Mohamed Salah needs some more help up top. He has carried the attack this term but looked a little tired in the big matches before the international break. Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez simply have not contributed enough. Federico Chiesa came on in the Carabao Cup final, looked lively and scored, so perhaps we will see some more of the Italian, with Cody Gakpo also out of form.In midfield, we need Ryan Gravenberch back to his best from the beginning of the campaign. In fairness, Arne Slot has run him into the ground, and hopefully the fact he has been sent away from Netherlands duty on a precautionary basis will enable him to recharge his batteries.Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones have all had good seasons, but it would be handy if they could chip in with a few more goals given the enormous reliance on Salah.At the back, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate have a brilliant partnership, but it is not looking great at full-back. Andy Robertson is having a poor season and a new left-back will be signed in the summer. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez are injured, leaving Jarrell Quansah as the right-back option.If Salah can find his ruthless best, however, Liverpool will have the title wrapped up before the end of April.What do you think?

The gap to Arsenal is too big.But the international break has come at a good time given Liverpool's Champions League exit and defeat in the Carabao Cup final in the space of a few days.Being dominated by Newcastle was the end of a tough week and could have really affected them in the league, but the fact they have this break gives them time to switch off from domestic football.This will definitely help them. You can overanalyse a lot of things after a week like that - when things seem to have turned. I've been in teams that have been performing really well and then exits from cup competitions have brought doubt and instability. There can be an overload of information and overthinking seeps in.The international break will give the players a refresh and different information.I do not see them losing four or five games between now and the end of the season and, in my opinion, the title is Liverpool's, but having that break to pause any negative momentum should get rid of any doubt.However, they have gone from a team that looked unstoppable and the best in Europe to one that look like they can be beaten. They were dominated completely out of possession by Newcastle and other teams will look at that.There is no shame in the Paris St-Germain result because they are one of the most exciting teams I have seen in recent years, but the manner of the defeat at Wembley could be a worry. The Magpies looked like they wanted it more and had more determination to win.It was around the time of Liverpool's Carabao Cup win last year that the wheels started to fall off in Jurgen Klopp's final season.However, they had a lot of injuries and the gap was not as big. It would be the biggest shock in Premier League history if they do not get it over the line from here.Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nat HaywardThe answerpublished at 13:52 21 March13:52 21 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesEarlier, we asked which player has appeared in the most Premier League wins for Liverpool.The answer is Jamie Carragher, who was involved in 264 victories.Real Madrid or Barcelona 'always been Van Dijk's dream' published at 08:54 21 March08:54 21 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesSpanish football expert Guillem Balague says that it would be Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk's "dream" to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona at some point.He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast: "I know for a fact that Van Dijk would like, at some point in his career and you start wondering if it's too late, to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona."That has always been his dream and I think is the dream of every professional player, especially those who reach the elite."This is Liverpool we are talking about but Real Madrid is something else and Barcelona is something else.

But they will be determined to put things right in their next league game."The Merseyside derby awaits Slot's side after the two-week March international break and Kirkland is expecting it to be "a hell of a game".He added: "Everton have been doing amazing under David Moyes. The transformation has been incredible since he has gone in there, so all credit to him."Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds'Your time comes... I don't think my time is there yet'published at 08:27 20 March08:27 20 MarchThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Andy Robertson has vowed to "always back myself" as Liverpool's links with a left-back signing refuse to go away.The Scot, 31, is nearing winning the Premier League for the second time in what is his eighth season at Anfield.The Reds however are repeatedly being linked with left-backs, most notably Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez.Asked about the links and how it impacts him, Robertson said: "I think we have been linked with pretty much every left-back in the world. That's part and parcel of it."I've been very lucky. I wouldn't put it down to luck. These eight years I have been the starting left-back at one of the best clubs in the world for that long."That is something that I am very proud of within myself. Your time comes. I don't think my time is there yet but whatever happens with the club if they do or don't bring somebody in, I always back myself."There have been a couple of moments this season where I have maybe not covered myself in glory but I also maybe think other things have been taken way out of proportion. Certainly the last couple of months the performance levels have been there for me. If you look back on all the games this season then I have had a relatively good season."The one thing people would say if you look back on my time at Liverpool is I have been fairly consistent, so when you maybe make slight mistakes that aren't necessarily put towards your name then people can talk. It's the world we live in. It's the Premier League for you, everyone has eyes on you and opinion, sometimes you agree and sometimes you don't."I'm always confident in my ability. I have shown that over my career and time at Liverpool. Hopefully that can continue."Gossip: Liverpool target Alvarez not for salepublished at 07:39 20 March07:39 20 MarchAtletico Madrid say their 25-year-old Argentine striker Julian Alvarez is not for sale, amid reported interest from Liverpool.

This was the demand that his players go at it 100% for 100% of the time.His phrase - "I don't want my players to conserve energy" - jarred horribly. No matter how young, fit, dedicated, well paid and willing you are, football players are still only human.They get tired, they get injured and they have to be managed. The entire Liverpool side at Wembley looked wearied to me, which was perfectly understandable considering the game against Paris St-Germain - 120 gruelling minutes then losing on penalties was physically and mentally exhausting. Mohamed Salah for one looked like a shadow of himself this week, especially when being dominated by the brilliant young Tino Livramento.So Slot is now having a few question marks nervously raised against his actions. Was having 5ft 9ins Alexis Mac Allister marking 6ft 7ins Dan Burn at corners a good tactic? Demonstrably not on the day. In retrospect, it looks bizarre especially as there was a warning before Burn's goal, when the centre-back effortlessly won an aerial dual at a previous corner kick. What about the personnel changes in the FA Cup that led to Liverpool meekly going out of the FA Cup against Plymouth Argyle?A harsh critic might even say this is the weakest Premier League in years at the very top end. Arsenal are limited by a lack of forwards, Manchester City are unrecognisably poor in comparison to recent seasons and Chelsea are in flux yet again.It is of course way harsh on Slot, winning the league in his first season is definitely good enough and getting PSG in the Champions League draw was very unlucky. If the likes of Arsenal were hard on their heels however, maybe those questions would be voiced a little louder.Sign up to read more from Pat Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter'Nothing between PSG and Van Dijk' - Laurenspublished at 07:46 19 March07:46 19 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesFrench football expert and regular BBC contributor Julien Laurens has played down links between Virgil van Dijk and Paris St-Germain.The Liverpool captain, who is out of contract this summer, was widely linked with a move to the French giants earlier this week.But posting on X, external, Laurens wrote: "There is nothing between PSG and Virgil van Dijk. No talks, no negotiations, no 100m signing on fee offer. Nothing. Virgil had a chat with Luis Campos and Nasser Al Khelaifi after the Champions League second leg and it wasn't about his future but about the two games they played."16:27 18 MarchLiverpool legend Hansen receives MBE, published at 16:27 18 MarchLiverpool legend Hansen receives MBEAttributionLiverpoolprevious pagePage 1 of 40123456â¦40next pageHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
