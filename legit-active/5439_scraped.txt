About us
Andrews McMeel Universal is a multi-faceted, global entertainment company, and one of the best-kept secrets in Kansas City.
We are:
•	A major book publisher
•	The largest newspaper and website syndicate
•	The country’s premier calendar publisher
•	An original greeting card studio
•	The world’s biggest comics based website
•	A major product and entertainment licensor to Hollywood…
…with exciting projects on the horizon, including live event production and digital animation.
Relentlessly strategic about content strategy, we seek out, discover, and nurture highly original creative talent and distribute it across as many platforms as possible. We’re into cartoons and other forms of illustrated humor, poetry, inspiration, advice, gift books, kid-lit, puzzles, and games.  We’ve represented 13 Pulitzer Prize winners, 15 Reuben Award winners, and over 20 New York Times best-selling authors. We do business in 120 countries.
We have a healthy and fun work environment and exceptional work-life balance. Kindness, collaboration, and individual empowerment are key cultural cornerstones at AMU, and the crazy-long long tenure and high engagement rates of our associates speaks volumes about the company.
