i would give him big 1000 negative stars if there was a choice. He messed my feet up. His staff was laughing when I was crying overwhelmed by the botched surgery he did on my feet. He kep me waiting for hours and then told me he was going to do additional procedure on my feet and told me it was going to be alright. It  turned out to be a disaster which I am still traumtauzed by. This man is not fit to be called a human being. His staff laughed when I was traumatized from my experiences with him. Other doctor told me he is.not qualified to donthe surgery he did on my feet. Both of my feet are disfigured now because of him.

Their staff is very friendly and professional. One of the first things I noticed about this business was the level of detail and attention to make the building handicap-accessible. Even the bathrooms were designed to be accessible with doors wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs and grab bars in the stalls. You could tell they really made an effort to accommodate people with all different needs. I've already told my friends and family about the fantastic experience I had there. They always go above and beyond to help me with anything I need. They never complain about anything, and I know I can always count on them.  I've never had to worry about them being understaffed or not being able to help me right when I need it. They have a huge staff that's very knowledgeable and qualified.
