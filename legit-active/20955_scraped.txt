acceptance. At the start of the novel, we learn about Mary's difficult beginnings as an unwanted child, juxtaposed against her father's ambitions and her mother's frailty. The initial chapters detail the setting of Mary's birth during a tumultuous storm, reflecting the turmoil that surrounds her life. From the accounts of her father, a once-peasant turned wealthy man, to her fragile mother who suffers both physically and emotionally, Mary finds herself grappling with her identity within a family that often seems at odds with her existence. As the story progresses, we witness the impact of familial expectations and societal pressures, setting the stage for Mary's quest for love and belonging.
