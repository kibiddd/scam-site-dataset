I remember her so vividly and she was a huge part of our family when she living in Florida. My Mom and Dad loved her dearly and when she lived next door to them it was happy hour every day.  My Dad loved that.  She was just a hoot.  I told her many times that she should have gone to Hollywood!!.  What fun she was.  I had them over for Thankgiving Day and I have to say it was the best Thankgiving we ever had.  Full of laughter and talking about the good old days.  Heaven will never be the same.
