Fishtank Ensemble
Arena Theater proudly presents Fishtank Ensemble, a not to be missed event for world music lovers. This acclaimed quartet plays cross-pollinated gypsy music with two explosive violins, the best slap bass player in the world, musical saw, flamenco and gypsy jazz guitar, trombone, opera, jazz and gypsy vocals, accordion and one little banjolele. Fishtank Ensemble tackles everything from French hot jazz to wild Serbian and Transylvanian gypsy anthems, Flamenco, and oddball originals.
