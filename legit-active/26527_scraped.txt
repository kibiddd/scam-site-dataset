Heaven Is Never Too Far

Published by Family Friend Poems 	August 2006 with permission of the Author.
Words cannot explain
how much you mean to me
nothing could ever compare
or even ever be
you're my papa, my one and only
you're my leaning post
although I love my family
you're the one I love most
even though you may be leaving
you'll still be in my heart
you'll always be real close
even though we're far apart
while you're in heaven, please watch over me
and help me as I grow
you have taught me so much
but there is still so much more to know
I'm not going to say good-bye
or that I can't go on
I'll say I love you and see you later
even though you're gone
I love you papa, more than you'll ever know
I know you'll be in heaven as a shining star
no matter how far away you seem
heaven is never too far

An hour ago, I received a call from my sister that my dad had just passed away. I had visited my dad 2 months ago, and he wasn't looking well then. I knew that would be the last time I would see him. Even so, we had a great time, singing his favorite songs over and over again on the Karaoke. So, when I received the call, thousands of miles away, an ocean apart, I knew the day had come. But even if you know the inevitability of death, if it's of a loved one, it's never easy. No thoughts. No words. So, I turned to one source that never fails to give me comfort: poems. Thank you for these poems that can wrench the sadness from my heart and put them into words. Thank you.

I was 14 when I lost my dad in car accident.  It happened on November 14, 2009.  This poem made me cry because I started thinking about him.  He was the only one I looked up to, he was my hero, he was the only one I could tell anything to. I could ask him for advice about anything but this poem touched my heart.  Good job and keep writing.

This poem is really emotional. I love it. My dad died in a murder where he got kidnapped. I was only 2 years old and he was found dead on March 7 1999. Now I'm 17 and all I say to God is that I would love to have one day with him, at least one. And I know that all this time he has been that one watching over me after God has. So many problems and difficulties but only God can help. This poem help me understand and it also helped me in controlling myself. Thanks GREAT WRITING!

This poem really touched me a lot because I lost my dad on April 4, 2012. I'm only 16 years old he died 8 days before my birthday and I really miss him a lot he taught me so many things but there is still much more to learn. I miss him so much and I never tell him goodbye because I know I'm going to see him one day in heaven.

The poem is so touching. I lost my Dad on Jan 29,2012. I would just wake up in the morning and thinking of him, his last moment, his last picture taken with me, his smile, the last birthday dinner....., I can't even go to his house now because I know he is not there anymore!  He could have turned 90 this April 6 and my b-day is 4/4, my mom is 3/28 and we would all go out to it. My brother and sister were planning to fly in this year to celebrate, they even bought tickets.  This would be the first time the whole family be together after so many years.  It is so sad that we had a funeral instead of birthday party for him!  It hurt so so so much just to think about that.  If you ask me what I want, I wish I have a time machine that I could turn back time!

This poem reminds me about when my dad passed away. My mom hates me, and so does my bros and sisters, but my dad was the only one who I love and who loves me. This poem is very inspirational and I love this poem.
