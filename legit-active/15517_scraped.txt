Downey Jr., Favreau Raise Iron Man 3 Red Flags
By Kyle Buchanan
It’s said that Jon Favreau was so frustrated by Marvel’s attempt to cross-promote The Avengers via Iron Man 2 that he declined to direct the third movie, but Favreau proved there are no hard feelings by appearing alongside Robert Downey Jr. at a screening of both Iron Man movies this past weekend. “The most difficult part of making Iron Man 3 is going to be negotiating Jon Favreau’s acting deal,” Downey Jr. joked at the Hero Complex Festival in Los Angeles. “It’s gonna be huge and I’ll see that they pay it.” Still, though Favreau has passed the directorial reins on to Shane Black, he reiterated that Iron Man 3 could be hamstrung by Marvel’s insistence on pushing Tony Stark into duty alongside its other heroes next summer for The Avengers. “I guess in comics you can say that it’s an individual storyline and you can break it off into a group. But in movies, it’s hard not to take into consideration what just happened,” noted Favreau. “What are you gonna say? ’[The other superheroes] all just lost their cell phones and you can’t get help?’ So it’s going to take a lot of ingenuity to make it make sense to a mainstream film audience as well as a comic book audience.” [/Film]
