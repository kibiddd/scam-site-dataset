Environments of ChangeDigitizing Nature, History and Human Experience
Welcome to Environments of Change! We are a transdisciplinary research network of scholars and industry partners who seek to use emerging digital technologies to provide research and tools to a wide audience (scholars, members of the general public, policy makers) on the historical relationship between humans, nature, and culture. Our network provides hundreds of training opportunities for students and emerging scholars to produce the next generation of digitally-inclined environmental thinkers.

Our team is creating an educational video game to teach elementary school children about the relationship between societies and their environments. The first version of this game is intended for use as part of the Grade 4 curriculum.
