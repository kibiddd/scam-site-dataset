MWT Intro – Placeholder from ManageWithoutThem on Vimeo.
Welcome
I’m here to talk about management. But I feel I’m using this word in an unusual way. When I say management I don’t mean:
a seperate class of people called “managers”
the separation of certain activities or rights – such as strategy, planning, leadership, or decision-making – and centralisation of these activities
just the soft skills such as focus on the people, or conflict management
aspects of any particular manager’s style – like those who make decisions with their gut, versus more analytical management approaches, or visionary leaders, or collaborative leaders, or even pointy-haired bosses for those who get the Dilbert reference.
When I talk about management I’m talking about more than that. I’m talking about everything that makes our organisations work.
I’m talking about a technology – where the word technology is used in its broadest sense. I’m talking about management as a tool we all use to make our organisations work.
When I talk about management I’m talking about something that I think is relevant to everybody.
Since 1998 I’ve used the phase “manage without them” to describe a model of this type of management.
