There was an initial problem with the unit and Mike the owner had the manufacturer come out and repair it right away. Was very satisfied with the service.VickyD.D.O.I Purchased a Salt system and Heat pump from Piscine Solutions and the following year the fan was making noise. Mike the owner contacted the company and arranged it to be repaired under warranty. Thanks, Mike.S. DutoyBeaconsfieldAs a long-time client of Piscine Solutions, when it came time to move my filtration system Mike was there to help. He relocated the equipment, painted the pool, and installed waterfalls, a new filter, and a second pump. As a Real Estate agent, I know what it means to provide excellent service and Mike comes through every time.TerryKirklandHired Piscine Solutions to change out and upgrade all our pool equipment. In addition to the filter and all the hoses, we changed over to a salt system as well. We trusted Piscine Solutions with the cleaning, painting, opening as well as the end-of-season winterizing. We are very pleased with all their work and we would recommend this company for all your pool needs.MikeBeaconsfieldMike fixed my leaks at my pump inlet and outlet fast and got rid of the annoying gurgling water at my returns. And on a Sunday morning!TerryKirklandNous avons engagé Piscine Solutions pour changer et effectuer une mise à niveau de nos équipements de piscine. Outre le filtre et tous les tuyaux, nous convertissions également à un système au sel. Piscine Solutions s’est occupé du nettoyage, de la peinture, de l’ouverture ainsi que de la préparation pour la saison hivernale. Nous sommes extrêmement satisfaits de leur travail et nous recommandons cette compagnie à tous qui possèdent une piscine.MichelBeaconsfieldMike a réparé rapidement mes fuites à l'entrée et à la sortie de ma pompe et m'a débarrassé du gargouillis d'eau gênant aux retours d'eau. Et ce, un dimanche matin !Get In Touch With Us!Call or Text: (514) 694-9917
