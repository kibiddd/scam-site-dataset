BiographyAwardsTriviaFAQIMDbProAll topicsSandra Gould(1916-1999)ActressIMDbProStarmeterSee rankPlay trailer1:11The Flintstones (1960–1966)4 Videos11 PhotosWhile she may have been a small-part character actress most her career, Sandra Gould possessed an unmistakable look and voice that she
called her own and separated her from the rest of the pack, contributing to four types of entertainment mediums (stage, screen, TV and radio) for over five decades.Short in height (just under 5') and with a very familiar chubby, chipmunk-like face, comedic actress Sandra Gould was born in Brooklyn on July 23, 1916. She kicked into high gear as a teenager with roles in the musical revue "Thumbs Up!" (1934) and comedy "Having Wonderful Time" (1937). Her unique voice was also ideal for radio and she appeared in scored of programs such as "My Friend Irma" and "Duffy's Tavern", the latter in which she replaced original star Shirley Booth. Sandra would go on to spend nearly 15 years on the radio airwaves with star Jack Benny on his legendary program.By 1947, the middle-aged actress began to be glimpsed in minor filming, appearing in dozens of small, urban bits. Typically, the unhelpful telephone operator or nurse, gabby receptionist, inveterate gossip, abrupt landlady or curt saleslady with her irrepressible New York flair, Sandra was glimpsed in such fare as
June Bride (1948),
Romance on the High Seas (1948)
and
My Dream Is Yours (1949)(both
with Doris Day),
Fourteen Hours (1951),
The Great American Pastime (1956),
Teacher's Pet (1958) (again starring Ms. Day)),
Imitation of Life (1959),
Honeymoon Hotel (1964) and
The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966).Seldom rising to featured status in films, TV comedy proved a more visible medium. Aside from being a regular on the series I Married Joan (1952) in the 1950s, audiences still fondly remember Sandra from her appearance on a classic I Love Lucy (1951) episode in which she played the fur-bearing wife of Harry Cheshire, a Southern tycoon whom Lucy suspects of selling her fraudulent oil stock. Gould also appeared in a number of popular comedy TV programs including "Our Miss Brooks," "December Brides," "The Danny Thomas Show," "Peter Loves Mary," "Pete and Gladys," "The Jack Benny Program," "The Lucy Show," "The Joey Bishop Show," "Mister Ed," "I Dream of Jeannie," "The Red Skelton Hour," "The Farmer's Daughter" and "Gilligan's Island." She also occasionally provided cartoon voices for "The Flintstones." In 1966, Sandra's biggest career break occurred when she was hired to replace the late Alice Pearce (who had died of ovarian cancer) as neighborhood snoop "Gladys Kravitz" on the classic sitcom Bewitched (1964). She stayed with the role for five seasons.Following this long-running sitcom success, Sandra slowed her busy schedule down, but never retired. Focusing more and more on her passions, art and writing, she still found plenty of time for TV comedy show appearances with featured parts on "Love, American Style," "The Brady Bunch," "Kolchak: The Night Stalker," "Marcus Welby," "Tabitha," (a 1977 spin-off of "Bewitched" in which she and TV husband George Tobias revived their "Abner and Gladys Kravitz" roles), "The New Leave It to Beaver," "Punky Brewster" and "Friends." She made her last on-camera appearances with 1999 episodes of "Veronica's Closet" and "Boy Meets World." Later sporadic film glimpses included Airport (1970), The Barefoot Executive (1971), Whiffs (1975), Chatterbox! (1977), Deep Cover (1992) and The Nutt House (1992).Twice wed and widowed, her first husband was broadcasting executive Larry Berns, by whom she had one son, writer/producer Michael Berns. Her second husband was TV director Hollingsworth Morse. Sandra died of a stroke on July 20, 1999, following bypass surgery -- three days before her 83rd birthday.BornJuly 23, 1916DiedJuly 20, 1999(82)BornJuly 23, 1916DiedJuly 20, 1999(82)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
