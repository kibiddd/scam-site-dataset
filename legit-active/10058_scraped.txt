Sigma Alpha Mu
Sigma Alpha Mu (ΣΑΜ), also known as "Sammy", is a college fraternity founded at the City College of New York  in 1909. Originally a Jewish-only organization, the fraternity became open to men of all faiths in 1953. Originally headquartered in New York, the national fraternity relocated its international headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana. Since its inception, Sigma Alpha Mu has initiated more than 63,000 members at more than 120 active and inactive chapters and colonies across the United States and Canada.
History
In the fall of 1909, the sophomore class at the College of the City of New York had found itself embarrassed by "lowly freshmen". At a school where "warfare" between freshman and sophomore class was a tradition, the sophomores found it necessary to regain their fallen honor. Class Marshal Lester Cohen called a meeting of sophomore leaders on November 26, 1909 to decide on a plan for redemption. Eight appeared in proper order Ira N. Lind, Jacob Kaplan, Lester Cohen, Samuel Ginsburg, Hyman I. Jacobson, David D. Levinson, Abraham N. Kerner, Adolph I. Fabis, who are now known as the Founders of Sigma Alpha Mu.

Sigma Alpha
Sigma Alpha (ΣΑ) is a professional agricultural sorority.
History
On January 26, 1978, five students, Ann Huling Mathews, Cindie Davis, Marilyn Burns, Jennifer McMillan and Amy Mathews, founded Sigma Alpha at the Ohio State University. Since that time, Sigma Alpha has become a national organization consisting of 60 collegiate chapters and 32 alumni chapters. Today, more than 11,000 members have been initiated into Sigma Alpha Sorority.
The sorority was named Sigma Alpha for "Sisters in Agriculture." The sorority official colors are emerald and maize, the mascot is the baby bull, the official flower is the yellow chrysanthemum, and the symbolic jewel is the emerald. The motto is Women Excelling in Agriculture. The objective of Sigma Alpha is to promote its members' roles in all facets of agriculture and natural resources.
Sigma Alpha is a member of the Professional Fraternity Association (PFA), a national organization of professional Greek letter organizations. Sigma Alpha Sorority is an affiliate of Agriculture in the Classroom, which is also the sorority's national philanthropy project. It belongs to the Consortium of Collegiate Agricultural Organizations.

List of Sigma Alpha Mu chapters
This is a list of chapters of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity.
Active chapters and colonies
The following is a list of active chapters and colonies (prospective chapters) recognized by the fraternity as of November 2013. There are currently 48 active chapters and three colonies. Chapters are listed in the order of their original founding.
Former Chapters
The Delta Beta chapter, originally founded in 1987 at the American University, disaffiliated from the national fraternity several times in the 1990s and 2003 for 'Poor Greek Relations' and failure to pay dues, Delta Beta then reorganized under the name Sigma Omega Alpha (ΣΩΑ). Delta Beta resumed affiliation with the National Fraternity in 2010.
The Delta Gamma chapter at the State University of New York at Oneonta, founded in 1985, disaffiliated with the National office in 1995 after recognized fraternities were no longer allowed to give bids to first semester freshmen.
The Delta Pi chapter at the University of Ottawa was ordered to cease operations in 2006, after a dispute with the National office concerning the National insurance policy. Delta Pi sought permission from the National office to find an alternative insurance provider that complied with Canadian law. The National office formally denied their request in August 2006. Delta Pi subsequently disaffiliated and became an independent fraternity. The same insurance dispute led to the failure or disaffiliation of all Canadian chapters by August 2008. On March 24, 2012 Delta Pi was recharted as a chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu and resumed affiliation with the National Fraternity.
