Overview

¬∑ view history
Micro√Øds was a game development studio founded in 1985 by Elliot Grassiano. In 1995 in addition to development it expanded into publishing and distribution.
Some of the best sellers in the company's large games library were primarily in the adventure genre: Amerzone, Syberia I and II, Still Life and Obscure.
The company employed over 200 people, 105 of which were based in their Montreal, Canada, development division.
Divisions active in April 2003 were:
Micro√Øds France (V√©lizy, France near Paris): publishing, sales, distribution, marketing
Micro√Øds Canada Inc. (Montreal, Quebec, Canada): development
Micro√Øds Ltd. UK (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom): publishing, sales, distribution, marketing
Micro√Øds Italia (Milan, Italy): publishing, sales, distribution (now Blue Label Entertainment Srl)
In 2003, Micro√Øds merged with MC2 and changed its name to MC2-Micro√Øds. In September 2003, the company acquired Wanadoo Edition including its complete catalog. The merging resulted in the forming of MC2 France. Founder Elliot Grassiano left the company and Emmanuel Olivier became CEO.
Within the next year, the Italian branch broke away from the company and changed its name to Blue Label Entertainment Srl.
In March 2005, Ubi Soft acquired Micro√Øds Canada, the company's Canadian development operations. Ubisoft Canada Inc, Ubisoft's Montreal Branch, got 50 of the employees who were integrated into Ubisoft's Montreal development teams. Only the Canadian division was effected. All other MC2-Micro√Øds branches were not involved, and MC2-Micro√Øds retained all assets and rights to their previous releases as well as projects in development.
In November 2007, the company announced the relaunch of the Micro√Øds publishing label lead by Emmanuel Olivier and other original founders of Index+.
The company briefly changed its name from MC2-Micro√Øds to MC2 and then back again to just Micro√Øds.
On 9 December 2008, the company was dissolved. The assets were bought by Anuman Interactive who went on to establish Micro√Øds as an internal development division as well as the continuation of the Micro√Øds publishing labels.

Trivia +
Micro√Øds, the developers and publishers of Syberia, has acquired the games subsidiary of Wanadoo. With this operation, Wanadoo becomes a shareholder to a total value of 12% of Micro√Øds. Wanadoo's core business consists of internet media services and broadband internet access in France, the UK, Spain and the Netherlands.
This deal was signed on September 30, 2003, and is part of Micro√Øds' moving out of a bankruptcy protection by the French government. The acquisition would seem to indicate a healthy continuation and expansion of the company. Previously, Micro√Øds has said it wants to "impose itself as a leader in the adventure game segment". Syberia II is their next adventure game and is scheduled for release in quarter 1 2004.
Micro√Øds now owns Wanadoo's complete catalog. This includes Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes game The Mystery of the Mummy.
