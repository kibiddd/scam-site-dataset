Roger Livesey + Ursula Jeans - the plays
The Powell & Pressburger Pages
Dedicated to the work of
Michael Powell
and
Emeric Pressburger
and all the other people, both actors and technicians
who helped them make those wonderful films.
A lot of the documents have been sent to me or have come from
other web sites.
The name of the web site is given where known.
If I have unintentionally included an
image or document that is copyrighted or that I shouldn't
have done then please
email me and I'll remove it.
I make no money from this site, it's purely for the love of the films.
[Any comments are by me (Steve Crook) and other members of the email list]
Thanks for this to
