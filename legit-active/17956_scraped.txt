Uncategorized  Holy Name Church Pre-Demolition			 Holy Name Church at 23rd and Benton, Pre-Demolition
We have the Holy Name Church at 23rd and Benton Boulevard on Kansas City‚Äôs east side, now facing imminent demolition with the owner of the old church building telling a judge he will indeed foot the bill for its demolition instead of the city.
Construction on this old church began in 1911 but wasn‚Äôt completed until the late 20s. The historical significance of the church as it aligns with Kansas City‚Äôs place in American history (MLK‚Äôs¬†assassination¬†and the Kansas City riots of 1968) can be detailed at this blog posting, and also a good write up of the situation as this pertains to Kansas City‚Äôs present situation in preservation of the built environment can be seen at a forum I used to visit, in the first post of this thread (click here). Hat tip to a contact there who got in touch with me over getting this shot before they knock down this old Gothic-style building. Also seen at Tony‚Äôs Kansas City and The Kansas City Star.
You could say there‚Äôs a slight bit of irony in the old church sitting across the street now from residential infill houses that when viewed out of context, would make you think you were in one of the suburbs like Lenexa or Blue Springs ‚Äì as evidenced by the late-80s looking split-level house to the far right in the background of the photo.
Photo from evening of Wednesday, January 5, 2011 at 23rd and Benton Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri.

I love the way you caught it with the tree to anchor in the upper right hand corner.  Nice.
Seems a shame for this thing to be torn down, doesn‚Äôt it?  C‚Äôest la vie, I guess.  At least, ‚Äúit is life‚Äù in the US.

We were told someone owns the church building and attorney owns the land. We were wondering if the property owner realizes they purchased Holy Land. The Church may be in ruins but the Land will always remain Holy. In other words, the Land will only bring riches in service to our LORD. ‚Ä†
