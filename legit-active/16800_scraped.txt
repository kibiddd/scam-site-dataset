over 80 films and 1,000 television episodes. Before becoming an actor
he worked as a boxer, a lumberjack, a truck driver and a cowpuncher.
Tall and handsome, he benefited from a screen test at 20th Century-Fox,
arranged for him by Sue Carol, a Hollywood agent and the wife of actor
Alan Ladd, who is said to have spotted Calhoun while he was riding a
horse in a Los Angeles park. He debuted on screen in Something for the Boys (1944), with
Carmen Miranda, billed as "Frank McCown". David O. Selznick changed his name to Rory
Calhoun, and after playing small parts for a while, he graduated to
starring in western films, including River of No Return (1954) with Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum.
Calhoun's better-known pictures include How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) with Lauren Bacall, Monroe
and Betty Grable, and With a Song in My Heart (1952) with Susan Hayward.From 1959 to 1960 he starred in the CBS television series The Texan (1958). More
than two decades later he returned to CBS for five years as Judge
Judson Tyler on the daytime serial Capitol (1982). His final appearance, 70
years old but handsome as ever, was as Ernest Tucker in Pure Country (1992).
Calhoun has two stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame: one for motion
pictures, and one for television.BornAugust 8, 1922DiedApril 28, 1999(76)BornAugust 8, 1922DiedApril 28, 1999(76)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list

A high school dropout, he stole a revolver at age 13, which landed him in the California Youth Authority's Preston School of Industry reformatory at Ione, CA. He escaped while in the adjustment center (jail within the jail). After robbing several jewelry stores, he stole a car and drove it across state lines. This offense sent him to the federal penitentiary in Springfield, MO, for three years. When he finished his sentence he was incarcerated in San Quentin State Penitentiary in California on other charges and remained there until he was paroled just before his 21st birthday.Quotes[on Susan Hayward] I learned a lot from that lady. I learned more about
my trade, about presence in front of the camera, by watching her. She
acted like it was nothing, with no effort.TrademarkBlack cowboy hatNicknameSmokeFAQ13Powered by AlexaWhen did Rory Calhoun die?How did Rory Calhoun die?How old was Rory Calhoun when he died?Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentLearn more about contributingEdit page
