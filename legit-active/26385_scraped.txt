SummaryELEMENTARY STATISTICS: A STEP BY STEP APPROACH is for introductory statistics courses with a basic algebra prerequisite. The book is non-theoretical, explaining concepts intuitively and teaching problem solving through worked examples and step-by-step instructions. In recent editions, Al Bluman has placed more emphasis on conceptual understanding and understanding results, along with increased focus on Excel, MINITAB, and the TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus graphing calculators; computing technologies commonly used in such courses. The 8th edition of Bluman provides a significant leap forward in terms of online course management with McGraw-Hill's new homework platform, Connect Statistics Hosted by ALEKS. Statistic instructors served as digital contributors to choose the problems that will be available, authoring each algorithm and providing stepped out solutions that go into great detail and are focused on areas where students commonly make mistakes. From there, the ALEKS Corporation reviewed each algorithm to ensure accuracy. The result is an online homework platform that provides superior content and feedback, allowing students to effectively learn the material being taught.Table of ContentsElementary Statistics: A Step By Step Approach by Allan Bluman1 The Nature of Probability and Statistics 2 Frequency Distributions and Graphs 3 Data Description 4 Probability and Counting Rules 5 Discrete Probability Distributions 6 The Normal Distribution 7 Confidence Intervals and Sample Size 8 Hypothesis Testing 9 Testing the Difference Between Two Means, Two Variances, and Two Proportions 10 Correlation and Regression 11 Other Chi-Square Tests 12 Analysis of Variance 13 Nonparametric Statistics 14 Sampling and Simulation Appendix A: Algebra Review Appendix B-1: Writing the Research Report Appendix B-2: Bayes’ Theorem Appendix B-3: Alternate Approach to the Standard Normal Distribution Appendix C: Tables Appendix D: Data Bank Appendix E: Glossary Appendix F: Bibliography  Appendix G: Photo Credits Appendix H: Selected Answers Supplemental MaterialsWhat is included with this book?TheÂ NewÂ copy of this book will include any supplemental materials advertised.
