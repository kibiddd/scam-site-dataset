Welcome...
So glad you stopped by to see me! I'm Joey W. Hill, and I write BDSM contemporary and paranormal romance. Since Dominance and submission can be expressed in endlessly fascinating and intense ways, my 50+ books and six series go down a variety of paths: M/f, F/m, M/m, M/f/M, F/m/f, IR, heroes/heroines with disabilities and more. My contemporaries might feature working class protagonists or millionaires, while my paranormals offer vampires, mermaids, angels, witches and sorcerers. I hope you'll find something that grabs you and doesn't let go, in all the right ways.
The menu items you see at the top have drop downs that will take you to all the great info you might be seeking about my books and series, plus bonus content ("revisit" stories, character interviews, etc). If you can't find something, click the envelope icon under Follow Joey on this page to email me directly. If you don't have an email client, such that it doesn't open, just email me direct at storywitch@storywitch.com. Easy-peasy.
Note the social media icons under Follow Joey to connect with me at any of those locations. I also have a page over at MeWe. Under the More menu, you can subscribe to my online newsletter (or click on the latest issue on that page if you don't want to subscribe) to keep you in the know on all my existing or upcoming stories.
It's wonderful to have you as readers. Visit anytime - best wishes and happy reading!
