"Wicked Games"
Coeur de Pirate covers The Weeknd
Frank YangMontrealler Béatrice Martin is also known as Coeur de Pirate but is best known for her lovely, piano-led Francophone pop, the likes of which populated her 2008 self-titled debut and made her a bit of an international star in the process.
But if you’ve seen her live, you’d know that she’s fluently bilingual and that she likes to show off both her English skills and knowledge of contemporary pop music with covers.  Lots of them.  From the stage she’s offered her take on the likes of Rihanna, Katy Perry and Phoenix, amongst others, and this Summer, while working on her second album Blonde, she took the time out to not only record a version of Toronto R&B sensations The Weeknd’s curse-filled, self-loathing “Wicked Games” from their House Of Balloons mixtape, but make a video for it as well.
Blonde is set for release this Tuesday, and Coeur de Pirate is at The Mod Club in Toronto this Friday, November 11, to celebrate its release.  Who knows what cover she’ll have planned for the occasion.  The Montreal Gazette, Montreal Mirror, and Beatroute have interviews with Béatrice Martin.  The Weeknd released the second part in their mixtape trilogy – Thursday – in August and the final instalment, Echoes of Silence, is due out this Autumn.
