This Conversation Is The Pits
In this article from 2017, they said Conversation Pits were making a comeback.There was more talk about them in 2022.  Better Homes & Gardens said they were returning in 2023.Architectural Digest covered them in 2024.And Apartment Therapy pondered whether they were making a comeback in this 2025 piece.I happen to love them.  They're cozy and cool.  I'd definitely consider one for my house.  I can see curling up in one of the corners with a book or my iPad, scrolling through more designs that I'd love to implement.  Of course, it's not really a TV-watching type of setup, so that would have to occupy another area of the house.We already have a semi-sunken living room in our house. Can I convince Ed to dig it a few more feet into the ground and cover it with plush cushions?We'll see!~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~2024: Cashing In On Chips Before Even Playing Them2023: Sorry, no post on this day.2022: Sorry, no post on this day.2021: Sorry, no post on this day.2020: Sorry, no post on this day.2019: Survivor2018: Today's Catch2017: Antiques Around EVERY Corner2016: Flashback Friday2015: The Rich Coast2014: Getting Hosed2013: River Of Grass2012: Stupid Rock2011: Crab Rangoon Makes Me Swoon2010: Bonnie And Clyde Meet Toni And Frank2009: Finally…A Bib That Is Both Functional And Accurate2008: Trickling Down2007: Anonymously Yours,2006: Over 7,000 Feet Of Pristine Beauty2005: Sorry, no post on this day.

Heeere's Johnny!
The mural and statue of Johnny Carson at 3rd and Norfolk Avenue in Norfolk, Nebraska.  Someone placed a tiny plastic Oscar statue at the base of his statue.  He never won an Oscar but he did host the Academy Awards five times.Johnny Carson was born in Iowa but his family moved to Norfolk when he was 8-years old.  He has always considered Norfolk his hometown.There's really no reason to visit this town, as they don't have anything worth seeing, but if you're driving through you'll know where to find his childhood home or this statue, in case you want to take a selfie.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~2024: White, Clean, Pure2023: Sorry, no post on this day.2022: Sorry, no post on this day.2021: Sorry, no post on this day.2020: Sorry, no post on this day.2019: I Don't Know How The Early Pioneers Did It2018: Do Not Be Afraid2017: Grounded2016: The Zombie Apocalypse Could Be In Full Swing And I'd Never Know2015: Creamery On Congress2014: Eastern Influence In A Southern State2013: The Wegmans Cheese Tour2012: Balls In The Air2011: Branded2010: Don’t Lose The Fun 2009: I’ll Get To It As Soon As I’m Done Churning The Butter, Dear.2008: Trees At Sunset2007: Giving Directions To This Place Is Easy2006: A Cloud Of Words2005: Sorry, no post on this day.

Where The King Of Late Night Spent His Childhood
We are currently in Norfolk (pronounced NOR-FORK), Nebraska getting our tarping system replaced.  There's not a lot going on in this small town in the Northeastern corner of Nebraska, but it is home to one of the most famous late-night hosts we've ever known.Johnny Carson was born in Corning, Iowa, but his family moved to Norfolk when he was 8 years old and has always considered it his hometown.  The house in the photo above was his childhood home.  Driving by and taking its picture was the most exciting thing that we've done here so far.  Next, we are going to see the mural and statue dedicated to Johnny in the downtown area of Norfolk. I grew up watching Johnny Carson with my grandparents.  Even at a young age, he had appeal.  His facial expressions, his laugh, and of course, Carnac The Magnificent.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~2024: Rock With Me2023: Sorry, no post on this day.2022: Sorry, no post on this day.2021: Sorry, no post on this day.2020: Sorry, no post on this day.2019: Czechian Garbage2018: Checking Out The Pipes2017: Gravitating Toward Good Tunes2016: A Little Thing With A Long History2015: It Was A Kona Kind Of Day2014: Award-Winning Plan2013: Watch Closely Now2012: Mission Of The Sacred Heart2011: Vintage Photo And Clothing2010: Just How I Like It…Cold And Colder2009: Snagged2008: The Writing Is On The Wall2007: Eddie Waits For A Ride2006: Truckers And Travelers Know Good Food2005: Sorry, no post on this day.

The Migratory Expressway
On our way through Nebraska, heading to a small town in the middle of nowhere to get our tarps replaced, we were overwhelmed by the amount of birds we were seeing.  So so so many birds!  A quick Google search revealed that Nebraska is a migration hotspot for birds because it's located between wintering and breeding grounds.  Millions of birds fly over Nebraska each spring through what's called the Central Flyway.More than 25 species, including Canadian geese, northern pintails, mallards, and sandhill cranes make their way across Nebraska each year.  About 500,000 Sandhill Cranes, or roughly 80% of the world's population, make a stop on the Platte River valley during spring migration. This migration begins in February and continues through mid-April.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~2024: Daughter Of The Wind2023: Sorry, no post on this day.2022: Sorry, no post on this day.2021: Sorry, no post on this day.2020: Sorry, no post on this day.2019: View From The Hill2018: Where Congress Is Cool2017: Inside The Queen2016: Glorious Tulips2015: Mayday!

The Waiting Game
Here we are, waiting in the driver's lounge at the Volvo dealership in Utah for a repair to be done on our truck.  It had fairly comfortable chairs, clean bathrooms, a crappy vending machine, and an even crappier coffee station. And we were there for TEN hours.  TEN!The repair is finally done and we're back on the road but holy moly.  The reason it took so long is because they put the part in, it didn't work, and they had to take it out and do it all over again.  Sheesh!What's next?~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~2024: Power And Nature2023: Sorry, no post on this day. 2022: Sorry, no post on this day. 2021: Sorry, no post on this day.2020: Sorry, no post on this day.2019: A Church Near A Castle2018: Sock It To 'Em2017: Linked2016: Stop And Pray2015: Stateroom 3422014: The Higher The Hair, The Closer To God2013: My Two Cents On Oscar Fashion2012: A Little Nip Of A Love Affair2011: It’s A Serious Addiction2010: Why Play Fantasy Football When You Can Spend Your Time Making Lists For The Halle Experiment?2009: I Hope There Isn’t Going To Be A Quiz2008: Sunglasses Required2007: Golden Eye2006: Making A List And Checking It Twice2005: Sorry, no post on this day.
