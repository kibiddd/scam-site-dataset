John Cox and Keith Carson Win the Clarks Hill South East Regional Championship
November 14, 2010
The final event in the Fishers of Men “2010 Regional Championship Series” came to a close today at Wildwood Park on Clarks Hill Lake, near Augusta, Georgia. We would like to congratulate Florida Central competitors, John Cox and Keith Carson, who rose to the occasion this afternoon and hauled in an additional 15.59 lbs of largemouths, for a 2-day total of 29.08. The new 2010 Fishers of Men South East Regional Champions earned a 2011 Triton TR-18, powered by a 150 hp Mercury Optimax, valued at nearly $24,000.00, championship plaques, the Day 2, 6.49 lbs, $420.00, 1st Big Bass Award and also lead the $10,000.00 Markel Insurance Points Champions race.After a one hour fog delay, the cool morning gave way to a beautiful day for fishing where many stated that the bite turned on after 12 o’clock. In 2 days of competition, 141 teams brought in 990 fish, weighing 1466.49 lbs, with 87, 5-fish limits on Day 1 and 64, today. The total weight does not reflect Clarks Hill Lake’s full potential, as the lake’s fall transition has not been completed and the weather has been hinky. Huge bass do go on feeding binges under stable conditions.The new champions concentrated their efforts at one location on both days. John and Keith  located a submerged bridge in shallow water way up on Georgia’s, Little River arm. Using weightless, white-ice, flukes over submerged hydrilla and carolina rigging them for deeper water, the skilled anglers pulled the trigger on their bass as large schools moved in and out of the area. Second place finishers Shannon and Kent Ware located their fish up past the 378 Hwy bridge on the Savannah River arm. Shannon and Kent brought in 13.78 on Day 1 and 12.23 today by ripping one-half ounce Rat-L-Traps through hydrilla in 3 to 4 feet of water for a tournament finish of 26.01 lbs. Today’s limit also included the Day 2, $280.00, 4.55 lbs, 2nd Big Bass.Day 1 leaders, Harold Branham and Jerry Tice, started today’s competition with 15.65 lbs.   Jerry and Harold worked carolina-rigged Zoom Trick Worms and Lucky Craft hard jerk-baits in 2 to 20 feet of grass-filled water, up the Savannah River, near the 378 bridge. When Al ask about today’s 9.78 lbs limit, Harold said that the larger fish just never moved in. Jerry and Harold finished the event with 25.43 and third place.Charging up four places to take the fourth slot with 24.37, Florida North’s, Clint Sheppard and Jason McClellan worked the Little River near Ridge Road Campgrounds, about ten minutes from the  launch ramp. Clint and Jason netted 11.11 on Day 1 and 13.26 today by throwing “everything at them”. However, their most productive tactics involved casting a Bomber Model 2A on points and channel drops over hydrilla, in about four feet of water and working the twenty foot depths with Zoom Redbug Trick Worms. Clint stated that today’s fishing was red hot, as they had culled four of their fish by noon. Rounding out the top five are Kevin and Konnor Sanders. The Georgia North Father-Son team fished Georgia’s Little River at the Griffins Bend area. Their fish came off the banks in the late afternoon in rocky areas and wood structure on clay shorelines. Konnors’s Day 1, 7.02 lbs beast fell for a silver, black back Shad Rap. Kevin stated that he would like to thank Boating Atlanta, where he had purchased their boat, as he is well satisfied with their new Triton.Since we have both a Male-Female and an Adult-Junior team in the top five, South Carolina’s, James and Jennifer Mizell, 16.42 lbs, and Georgia South’s, Derrick and Blane Millirons, 13.51 lbs,  will be heading to next April’s  Guntersville Lake National Championship. To earn the opportunity to compete in the South East Regional Championship, anglers from 8 divisions in: Alabama (2), Florida (2), Georgia (2), and South Carolina (2) had to battle their way to the top of their respective divisions through five qualifying events by earning points. Points are awarded to the competitors according to how they place in the tournaments. Anglers also are awarded 50 extra points for attending the Friday night meetings.The top ten finishers, by weight, along with the highest finisher from each division, all “Division Points Champions”, plus the top male/ female and adult/junior teams from each of this year’s Regional Championship Series will earn a berth to the 2011 FOM National Championship, to be held April 7, 8, & 9, 2011, on  Guntersville Lake, Alabama, where they will compete for nearly $100,000.00 in cash and prizes.We want to thank the Columbia County Convention and Visitors Bureau, Jeb Bell, the Wildwood Park Coordinator, Charlie Beale, Recreation Department Manager, everyone who prepared and served the meal at Patriots Park Bobby Waters Gymnasium, Chris Wells of Wellspokenministries, and Barbara Hagan, from Hawthorn Suites, the Host hotel.We would like to take this opportunity to also thank all the fine companies that make Fishers of Men possible; Primary: Triton Boats, Mercury, Strike King Lure Company, Markel American Insurance, Abu Garcia, Power-Pole, Nester Hosiery.
