TUTTA COLPA DELLA MUSICA
by Ricky Tognazzi
synopsisGiuseppe is forty-five, married, with a daughter, but he cannot be described as “happy“. Grazia, his wife, a religious fanatic and fervent Jehovah’s Witness, has had a relationship with him, which for years has been based on cold indifference. Chiara, the daughter, has followed her mother in her religious infatuation, and hasn’t really much rapport with him either. Napoleone, his closest and long-standing friend, tells him to shake his life up a bit and try to “live“, convincing him to join him at the city’s choir. The choir meets in a former church, where guys his age can still have fun and even “go on the pull“. Giuseppe embraces his new life to the full and falls in love with Elisa, a very beautiful middle-aged woman he met at the choir.
