I have been listening to Kiss FM, since they first started in the 1990's.  I always injoyed them because they played R and B and Soul from the 1960s to now. No other station had that selection. I was use to the DJS and the music. Now when I turn on Kiss FM, it has changed as of May 2016. I don't regularly watch TV and only saw one commercial for the new channel. When I turn on 98.1, I didn't hear R&B, funk, or hip hop.  I heard music never played on this station. I will never listen to this station again. I assumed you fired all the DJs too.  That's what corporations do, buy stations fire everyone and change it to sucky ass music. Corporations don't care about what people want to hear you care about money and play music your corporation wants to promote.By: Beatrice Nelson on May 5, 2016
