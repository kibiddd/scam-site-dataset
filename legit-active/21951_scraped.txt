This '32 Ford Woodie is owned by Al Engel
Al Engel, from Point Richmond, California, purchased this 1932 Ford Woodie out of the Towe Ford Museum in Sacramento. The car was originally owned by a family in Missouri and was restored before it went to the museum. The woodie was stored for almost ten years before Al decided to give it a complete makeover. View the photos that follow and see how it was transformed from a stocker to a real go getter. The only change to the stock body that we had to make was to alter the firewall to clear the distributor. Also check out the battery jumpers we installed next to the gas tank area.
