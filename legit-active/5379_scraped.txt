This guy has balls, an in-your-donkeys ass- face attitude, awesome guitar and vocal skills (i lost count when he was holding thoughs damn notes last night, i think i got up to about 30 seconds)he has come a long way vocally... heck lets face it, he knows how to use what hes got!! If people say he is a lazy ass, they obviously have never been to one of Green Day's concerts, ever downloaded any of their performances, heard from many of their fans... or have simply lost their minds. Because if you have, you about know that these guys give it their all!! In my opinion, they rock more than Simple Plan and Blink 182 live. These guys really do work their asses off onstage to make sure everyone in the fucking crowd is shaking their booties.Billie Joe Armstrong - SEX MACHINE!
