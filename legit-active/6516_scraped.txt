Anastacia – Freak Of Nature                                lyrics
I'm a freak
Spoken:
Excuse me
What u said to me?
Oh no u said that
No I'm not
I'm sorry but, you know
I ain't that kind of girl
Look at me and see a little girl inside my skin
It's a supernatural
Oooh
So don't be trying to push upon me baby
My momma taught me better than that
The bigger you are
The harder you fall
I'm a bobby original
Not typical
Not ooh la la baby
You can hold me responible
It's chemical
If you're bringin' it out in me
Aaaaaah ah aaaaaaaaaaah
I'm a freak of nature
You better be aware, danger
Aaaaaah ah aaaaaaaaaaah
I'm ur midnight angel
I'm a freak
Come on yeah
I'm a freak of nature
I'm a little material, got bling bling
My glasses got a shade
Yeah
But does it hit me
It chicken me
That barefoot walking in the grass
Just cause I like sipping on champagne
Doesn't mean that I'm afraid of the rain
