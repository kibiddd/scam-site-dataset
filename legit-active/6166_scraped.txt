"Everything went smoothly. We caught the last shuttle from the airport to the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly, and breakfast was good. I recommend this hotel.2022-10-07""Nice hotel. A good choice.2017-06-02""The hotel room was nice and clean; we were near the elevator and never heard any noise. Breakfast was good and well-maintained. Ask for a room away from the front door; the back-up beeper on the airport shuttle woke me up a few times during the night.2016-12-06"     < Hide

"We arrived at the hotel at check-in time, but had to wait an hour to get in our room. Then we didn't have enough towels to accommodate our family. The housekeeper was rude and wouldn't give us any additional towels. Not a great experience.2015-06-23"     < Hide

"The room was comfortable enough, but the bathtub wouldn't hold water. There was a broken smoke alarm on the counter, and the fan above the stove didn't work. The same dirt on the hallway floor was there the 3 days we stayed. The hotel clerk was accommodating. I'll probably stay elsewhere next time.2017-06-13"     < Hide

How Do We Order Hotels?
On place pages like this, we order hotels from lowest cost to highest – except we list low-rated hotels at the bottom of the page.
Most of our competitors order these same hotels in other ways that make them more money.
How Do We Define Motel?
To us, motels are smaller lodgings that have rooms you can enter directly from the parking area.
At hotels, on the other hand, you can enter your room only through a hall inside the building.
Hotel Booking Tips
Beware of non-refundable reservations that could cost you a lot of money if you change or cancel them. +Non-refundable reservations are a gamble that will usually save you less than $10. If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -
Don't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot – because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -
Always read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -More >
When you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.
The earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.
