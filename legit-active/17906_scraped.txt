Our unique funding model allows the freedom to explore the unexpected.Transformational science requires the transformation of science. Through the unparalleled generosity and vision of our founders, Jim and Virginia Stowers, we have a scientific ecosystem that encourages discovery and innovation. Jim, founder of American Century Investments, and Virginia followed their initial generous investment by establishing a funding model that provides ongoing support of our research through the annual dividends from American Century Investments. Because of this structure, Stowers scientists are uniquely positioned to explore with freedom, and allowed the ability to follow biological avenues that lead to novel discoveries and to share their findings for the betterment of humanity.American Century Investments
