DIG: Notes on Field and Family
PURCHASE HERE
Before he dies, photographer Sarah Wilson’s paleontologist grandfather gives her three metal boxes of faded Kodachromes. Holding the slides up to the light, Wilson realizes that she and her grandfather photographed some of the same desert landscapes, from the same vantage points, only fifty years apart.  This realization ignites an adventure, following the same paths he once took through the deserts of the American West, digging for 40 million-year-old fossils and searching for answers to mysteries of Deep Time, and our place within it.
