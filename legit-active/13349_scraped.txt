LaChapelle, one of the world's top fashion snappers, has filed a lawsuit against the singer, her label and video production company, alleging that S&M is "directly derived" from some of his magazine shots.Almost 12 million people have watched Rihanna's S&M video on YouTube since its 31 January launch, despite – or perhaps because of – it being banned in 11 countries. While the song itself has been edited for daytime radio in the UK, the video is more suggestive than pornographic, with whips, latex and the kind of sexual imagery that Madonna used in 1985. But naughtiness may not be the video's worst offence: according to a lawsuit by LaChapelle, the Melina Matsoukas-directed video was based on, and is "substantially similar to", eight of his own previously published photographs.Rihanna's video allegedly copied the "composition, total concept, feel, tone, mood, theme, colours, props, settings, decors, wardrobe and lighting" of LaChapelle's work. While blogger Perez Hilton – who appears in the video – has assembled a handful of side-by-side comparisons, the lawsuit draws particular attention to a sequence that features Rihanna in a PVC hood, a piece of candy on her tongue. Years before, LaChapelle shot a model in a similar pose, with a similar pink-and-blue colour scheme. In a tweet that has since been deleted, LaChapelle lashed out at Rihanna: "The next time you make a David LaChapelle music video you should probably hire David LaChapelle."According to LaChapelle's suit, S&M's coincidental imagery is no coincidence. Matsoukas was instructed to create a "LaChapelle-esque music video", the photographer claims, and prints of his photographs were as a storyboard. LaChapelle alleges that another "well-known video director" was offered to make the video, under the same aesthetic instructions, but declined.LaChapelle has shot many A-list celebrities for magazines including Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair and GQ. He last worked with Rihanna in 2007, shooting the singer for the MTV VMAs.Rihanna, 22, has sold more than 25m albums worldwide.Explore more on these topicsRihannaPop and rockR&BPhotographynewsShareReuse this contentComments (…)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
