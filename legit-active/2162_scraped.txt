If this company is so real then why dont they have a website and if they are located in jacksonville florida, then why did i send my money to hpc in my local town and state, they also wanted me to put jones-steel in the message. I feel so stupid  now, but i was so shook up. i want everyone to know they are not real, and i have also contacted money gram. i did find a company with the bbb but it is h @ p capital, inc. in jacksonville florida,so they are impersonating this other company. so i am out $740 the 700 plus  40 for the cost of moneygram to send it      This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 08/19/2009 07:37 PM and is a permanent record located here:
