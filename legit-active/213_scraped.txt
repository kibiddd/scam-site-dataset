About Me
Hi, my name is Kat DeLeon. I'm an experienced model that is represented by Kathy Muller Talent and Modeling Agency.  I am also Shoot Producer and a stylist for Vortex Magazine (Hawaii).  I'm a petite model and Spokesmodel for Bella Petite.  I'm interested in all different types of modeling and am open to all tasteful ideas. I am only accepting paid jobs at this time.
*SELECT TF's WILL BE CONSIDERED*
1) If your "Fashion" or "Beauty" port is better or equal to mine I will consider TF because you obviously have something to offer me that I cannot pass up.
2) If it is a guaranteed published opportunity.
3) You are a designer of high fashion or couture outfits.
If I don't TF with you I am sorry. I wish I could shoot with everyone and do it TF because I love to shoot, however, anyone that tells you TF is not costly is naive. It's costly for everyone involved.
Before you ask for trade you need to know that I will need large edited images big enough to print in my book, OR a CD of large images of our final edited images. As a model I need images for my book and not just for MM or Facebook. I also expect images to be given to me in a reasonable amount of time. If we are trading, photos are my pay...
I have a professional attitude and look for the same in people that I work with. I consider myself to be pretty fun and outgoing and easy to work with.
I live in Hawaii but I am willing to travel for work if expenses are covered. I would love to work with photographers while traveling or photographers that travel to Hawaii. Most of my personal travels take me to California, Las Vegas, Florida, and Massachusetts.
I am here for networking and professional purposes only. If you are interested in working with me please don't hesitate to contact my agent Joy Kam (Agency Director) at telephone number 808-737-7917 or email her at [email protected].
I look forward to working with you.
