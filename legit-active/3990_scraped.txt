That experience led to a year and a half of study at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse, where his classmates included Gregory Peck, Eli Wallach and Tony Randall. Throughout the 1940s Tobey acted on Broadway and
in stock; he made his film debut in a 1943 short, "The Man on the Ferry." He made his Hollywood film bow in a Hopalong Cassidy Western, and has since appeared in scores of features and on numerous TV series. He even had his own series, Whirlybirds (1957), in which he played an adventurous helicopter pilot.BornMarch 23, 1917DiedDecember 22, 2002(85)BornMarch 23, 1917DiedDecember 22, 2002(85)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
