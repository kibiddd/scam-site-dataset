NFL Draft 2011: Which Defensive Lineman?

It's draft day and the Patriots are on the clock for the 28th pick overall. You've been feeling pretty good about the day because you already selected Aldon Smith at 17th overall. You're ready to make your pick at #28, when the Patriots get called up to the podium. In a quick flash of confusion, Bill Polian constructs a rule where "the team who possesses the 28th pick overall must select a defensive lineman and they cannot trade away the draft pick." Tricky Polian! You are in the draft room and you must make a quick decision. Nick Fairley, Marcell Dareus, and Cam Jordan are all off the board. However, by sheer luck, the following players are still available:
Adrian Clayborn, DE, Iowa
Cameron Heyward, DE, Ohio State
Corey Liuget, DE, Illinois
Stephen Paea, DT, Oregon State
Phil Taylor, DE/NT, Baylor
J.J. Watt, DE, Wisconsin
Muhammad Wilkerson, DE, Temple
You have to make a quick decision- which of these players do you take at 28?
Make sure you consider their measurements, college production, and intangibles when making your decision. Which player best complements the Aldon Smith pick? Which player could start immediately? Who has the highest ceiling?
Good luck and happy debating!
