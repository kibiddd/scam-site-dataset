This week:
The UConn Huskies will host the Iowa State Cyclones from the Big 12 Friday night at 8 p.m. at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, CT.
Here are the rosters for the Huskies and the Cyclones.
The Line/Prediction:
According to Rivals.com odds, the Huskies are 4.5 point favorites. The over/under is 44.
My prediction is UConn 24 Iowa State 21 on a late field goal.
Tickets:
According to Ticketmaster.com, there are plenty of seats available for the game.
Getting To The Game:
Here is link for the weather report. Here is all the parking info you will need for the game, this link includes directions to Rentschler Field. Here is a Rentschler Field seating chart and here is some general information for Rentschler Field.
The parking lots will open up 4 hours before kickoff. Here is a list of the tailgating rules at the Rent.
At UConn home games, FanFest takes place starting four  hours before kickoff up until 30 minutes before the game. This year, it  moves to between Gates A and B outside the stadium gates.
The offerings change each game, but activities typically  include inflatable games for children, live bands, promotional vehicles  and UConn student-athletes from various team signing autographs.
The “Husky Walk” is a chance for fans to welcome the  UConn teams as they get off the team buses and head to the stadium. That  takes place at approximately two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff  between Gates A and B.
Starting this season at the end of home games, the UConn  team will sing the “UConn Husky” fight song in front of the student  section at Rentschler Field.
Friday night’s game will be Green Awareness Night at Rentschler Field. The annual event is part of the “Husky Honor” program that promotes sportsmanship as well as sustainability and environmental responsibility at UConn athletic events. UConn was recently ranked No. 16 in the country in the Sierra Club’s annual ranking of the nation’s “greenest” universities. EcoHusky student volunteers will be on site Friday night to help fans recycle bottes and cans and to raise awareness about what the University and Rentschler Field are doing to reduce waste and minimize the carbon footprint at a UConn game.
