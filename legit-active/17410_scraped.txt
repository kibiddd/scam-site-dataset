1918
Charlie Chaplin was the first actor to have a million

1918
The first Tarzan film, director Scott Sidney's black and white
Tarzan of the Apes (1918), premiered at the Broadway Theater in New York,
with the first actor to portray Edgar Rice Burroughs' 'Lord of the Jungle',
Elmo Lincoln, as an adult. [Elmo Lincoln was a former Arkansas police officer, who had also appeared in several D.W. Griffith films.] Technically, the 'first' Tarzan, a 10-year old youthful Tarzan in the same film, was portrayed by Gordon Griffith. It was the first film adaptation with the Tarzan character,
based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' original novel Tarzan of the Apes about the jungle lord. The milestone film was one of the first films to earn over a million dollars.
1918
The US Supreme Court had ordered the Motion

the Edison Company abandoned the film industry.
1918
Early cartoonist and animator Winsor McCay's 12-minute propagandistic, documentary-style The Sinking of the Lusitania, an animation landmark, was the first serious re-enactment of an historical event - the torpedoing of the RMS Lusitania by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915, resulting in the loss of almost 2,000 passengers. It was one of the earliest films to utilize cel animation.
1918
The first full-length Technicolor film produced in the
US was The Gulf Between (1918). It used Technicolor Process Number

1918
Though the silent film Cupid Angling (1918) was
advertised as the first color feature-length film (using the Douglass

colors"), both Kinemacolor and Technicolor had produced
prior feature films in color.
