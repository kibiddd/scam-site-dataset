Welcome to Richard Feather Anderson’s American School of Geomancy Enhance your sense of belonging to the places where you live, work and visit — so you feel held and nurtured by your surroundings.Strengthen your innate abilities to sense and find the best places for all your activities, functions and structures — so that the specific energetic qualities of each spot fully support your desired use of the space.Live, work and play in environments that are designed, arranged and decorated in ways that make it easy and joyful to accomplish your goals every day — by taking full advantage of the wisdom embodied in feng shui, timeless architecture, and environmental psychology.Increase your awareness of the life force pulsing within yourself and all forms of life — so you can commune with tree and plant spirits, and the Spirit of Place, and live in harmony with the “story” of a place.Stay grounded in the midst of stressful situations.Feel intimately connected with Nature as a living presence — to heal any sense of separation between yourself and the Earth.
What kind of “School” is this?Within Chinese culture the term feng shui “school” does not refer to an educational institution like a college or university; rather it refers to a particular philosophical perspective, approach and set of techniques employed in the practice of the art of harmonious placement. In the west the equivalent term would be “method” or “tradition,” as in the Socratic Method of teaching, or the Swedish-Esalen Method of massage therapy, or the Pythagorean Mystery School tradition of philosophy and art.In that spirit the American School of Geomancy is a school of thought devoted to the revival of the global arts of placemaking, by exploring them with a fresh perspective, and devising and disseminating common-sense explanations for the often confusing ways that feng shui is presented as a set of enigmatic rules and formulaic design solutions.
Let me introduce myself — I am Richard Feather AndersonI’ve been blessed with unique gifts that I can offer you to help satisfy your longing to feel at home anywhere.
Through a lifetime of study and extraordinary experiences, I’ve been able to distill a vast body of knowledge, skills and techniques, learned from many diverse disciplines, masters, and cultures, into a set of common-sense principles for good design and harmonious placement, all based on the laws of Nature.I’ve developed ways to hear the “story of place,” read the lay of the land, understand the dynamics of a space, and envision creative ways to improve the arrangement, function and feel of your environment.My clients and students continually express their appreciations for how clearly I communicate my insights and visions about how to enhance their inner life and outer environment. And that’s a gift I cherish.
Feel at Home Anywhere! — by using geomancy, feng shui, and other arts of enhancing your sense of place, self and community — in harmony with the laws of Nature.

TestimonialsOn Publications:  “Yours is the most succinct, easy-to-understand writing on feng shui I’ve ever read. It made sense in a practical, common-sense way to my western layman’s mind.” — Andy Nusbaum, executive director, Esalen Institute, Big Sur, CA.READ MOREOn Seminars:  “I am loving your classes! Oh my goodness, I didn't know I would love Sacred Geometry as much as I do! It is intense, but Wow, it is amazing! I was out walking in the woods today and looking for it in everything around me. You have definitely struck a chord with me. I love your teaching style too. I am very meticulous and methodical about how I learn and work, so it is easy to follow along with your style of teaching.” — Beverley East, sound healer at Divine BlessingzREAD MOREOn Feng Shui Consultations:  “Words can barely describe how much I appreciate Richard and his knowledge of Feng Shui. I was moving into a new apartment and had Richard come to advise me on the placement of things. Instead of just saying, ‘Put this here; put that there,’ he actually spent time with me explaining how Feng Shui works, and the movement of energies within my place. It was an education for me to see the flow of energy from a new perspective. His insights, and especially his way of communicating his knowledge, is outstanding. What a special gift Richard is to this world!” — Patricia Haller, certified Unity Teacher, Grass Valley, CAREAD MOREOn Architectural Design/Review:  “Richard is the only Feng Shui person I know who deals with the problems of culturally-specific rules that don’t make sense for America. He has created a ‘Geomancy for Westerners,’ by pulling out the universal principles of good design, and filtering out the rules that are only relevant if you live in the hot climate of India or the cold, windy plains of northern China.” — Claudia Cleaver, architect, Petaluma, CAREAD MOREOn Site Reading & Planning Consultations: “I almost don't have words for the joy and excitement I feel from your site reading. I can't stop talking or thinking about it. I know that our Vision Quest in Ireland opened me up to the power and wonder of our relationship with nature. But you walking our land - with your love, sensitivity, enthusiasm and knowledge - exponentially amplified that relationship. I’m stoked!! Your redirecting the exchange of payment for services into a beautiful and powerful love offering, was over the top!!!” — Dr. Anne Richards, leadership coachREAD MORE
