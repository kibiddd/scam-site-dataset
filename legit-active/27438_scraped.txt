The opening scene of the natives of South America dancing is a well edited opening, and the word 'Angels" appears over it.  Indeed, all the Angels in this film are not in England (where the rest of the film takes place). William Adamson (Mark Rylance), a biologist who collects rare insects (especially the butterfly), survives a shipwreck and comes under the protection of an upper class English family.  That's where he falls in love with Eugenia (Patsy Kensit).  But every family has it's secrets.  Someone described this as "Merchant-Ivory meets Tennessee Williams", which is a perfect way to describe this film.  Several have complained about the actors, saying that there is not a single stand-out performance.  I disagree, as both Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas (in a performance worthy of an oscar nomination) acquit themselves well.  The script is also very well written, and the costumes deserved the Oscar nomination.  One of the ten best of 1996.ArkaanMar 17, 2000PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Angels and Insects?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateDecember 8, 1995 (United Kingdom)Countries of originUnited KingdomUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asDes anges et des insectesFilming locationsArbury Hall, Nuneaton, UKProduction companiesPlayhouse International PicturesThe Samuel Goldwyn CompanySee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$4,997,987 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$3,414,301Gross worldwide$3,414,301See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 56 minutesSound mixDolby SRAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Spanish language plot outline for Angels and Insects (1995)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
