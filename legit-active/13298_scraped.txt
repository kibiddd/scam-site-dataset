The owners of the copyright on the films - Russian film studio Mosfilm and the Joint State Film Collection (Obyedinennaya Gosudarstvennaya Kinocollectsia) - have told the BBC they have not given consent for their films to be sold in the app stores."It is illegal to present our films as applications either in iTunes or on any other internet site. It is permitted only on our own Mosfilm site," Svetlana Pyleva, Mosfilm's deputy director general, said in an interview with bbcrussian.com."The only official internet site where you can watch legal Mosfilm content is the Mosfilm site," she said. "There are no third parties which we have permitted to use our content."Image caption, Apple said it would respond quickly to complaints about copyright violationsMs Pyleva said Mosfilm management was aware of the problem and was preparing to submit a claim to Apple."Maybe Apple will take appropriate measures and help us solve the problem," she said.Apps, self-contained programs or content for gadgets, are often written by programmers working independently or under contract for a company keen to get their creations in front of a wider audience. Apps can be original or adaptations of existing programs and games. Before apps make it to the iTunes store, they are submitted to Apple for consideration and, if approved, are made available on iTunes.Making contactEkaterina Toropova, press secretary of the Joint State Film Collection, which holds copyright for some of the films put on the Apple store, told bbcrussian.com that it had not issued licences for such applications. "The [Joint State Film Collection] retains all exclusive rights," said Ms Toropova.Until told by bbcrussian.com, the JSFC was unaware that some of its films, including Cheburashka, were being sold as an app for iPhones and iPads."We'll try to get in touch with the developers," said Ms Toropova. "It is possible that they obtained licences from someone else and they themselves are in the dark as they are sure that they sell a legitimate product.""We'll explain to them that they are wrong," said Ms Toropova.In response, Apple said it would investigate. "We understand the importance of protecting intellectual property and when we receive complaints we respond promptly and appropriately," Christine Monaghan, Apple's official representative, told bbcrussian.com.Law-breakingThe BBC's Russian Service spoke to Vladimir Penshin - a programmer who lives in Ukraine who has created an app for iTunes from the film Cheburashka."Of course, I do not have any licence agreement," he said. "This is all very simple. The companies, who can have complaints, submit them to Apple and Apple notifies me that they have to withdraw the application."Mr Penshin confirmed to bbcrussian.com that he deliberately decided to offer unlicensed material for sale to gain profit. Mr Penshin has also created and offered for sale an application based around the animated series Penguins of Madagascar, produced by US studio Dreamworks."I realise that this is wrong," he said. "Maybe I am breaking the law."More on this storyTruth and fiction in The Way BackPublished4 December 2010Related internet linksMosfilmMosfilm Cinema siteThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesRussia and Ukraine agree naval ceasefire in Black SeaPublished4 hours agoThe long, slow road to a ceasefire, with no guarantee of successPublished2 hours agoTrump will 'look into' use of Signal app as he defends security adviser WaltzMore to exploreHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coachFive takeaways from leaked US top military chat groupWhy is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?The 30-year quest to catch a national records thief'As a student, Â£800 a month is quite tight'Strange spiral seen in the sky - BBC explains what it wasChris Mason: Chancellor says the world has changed - but what are her options?Millions of UK tyres meant for recycling sent to furnaces in IndiaThe Upbeat newsletter: Start your week on a high with uplifting stories delivered to your inboxElsewhere on the BBCAn explosive Agatha Christie murder mysteryLily and Miquita answer your questions about menstruationTom Hanks guides you across the AmericasStephen Mangan washes up on an island adventureMost read1Sussex university fined Â£585k in free speech row2Laurence Fox charged over Narinder Kaur upskirting image3Disdain for Europe in US Signal chat horrifies EU4Body of newborn baby found in bag at London church5Russia and Ukraine agree naval ceasefire in Black Sea6Five takeaways from leaked US top military chat group7Joey Barton guilty of kicking wife in the head8Grandparents arrested on suspicion of toddler's murder in French Alps9Unique two-clawed dinosaur discovered 10Reeves to focus on Â£2bn defence boost in Spring StatementBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
