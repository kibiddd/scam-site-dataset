Product Review - CD Storage Tower - Holds CD / DVD / VHS - Black
Product Reviews:4 user rated 4.3 out of 5 starsI purchased two of these units for our living room to store our vast DVD collection which is constantly growing. Highly recommended. - JasmineLove this! It matches so well with our existing stereo and speakers unit. We have plenty of room to add additional CDs as we purchase them. - GiannaVery nice storage tower. Worth every penny! It looks SUPER COOOL!!!!!!! Far exceeded my expectations.. - MarkWe bought 2 of these units and also the Double Wall Mount CD Storage Furniture Media Shelf - Venture Horizons 2422.  We placed the 2 tall slender units on top of the larger shelf leaving wall space between them for black & white photos.  It looks great.  Very functionsl.  Also, we omitted some shelves leaving room for white ceramic art.  An easy way to make a mini built-in wall unit. - Ms Sputnik
