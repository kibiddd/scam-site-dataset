Faithful by Lobo ( Lyric Video )
Faithful by Lobo
LYRICS:
I never wanted anyone before
Half as much as I want you
I finally found what I've been searching for
My whole life through
You're the answer to the prayers I've prayed
More than I've ever dreamed of
So I give to you my heart today
And pledge my eternal love
I'll be faithful, faithful till the end
I'm so thankful that heaven
Chose to send you
And this love will last forever
Forever I'll be true
And be faithful to you
You're my one and only one you see
There's just no one to compare
I'll hold and keep you close to me
Way beyond our golden years
Our two hearts will always beat as one
One thing you can know for sure
I promise that I'll never let you down
Your trust in me's secure

Lyrics:
When I felt like the burden
Was more than I could hold
When the whispers of worry
Overwhelmed my soul
You never left me alone
You were there all along
You are faithful
Why should my heart be afraid
You are faithful
I know you’re not gonna change
You are faithful
Faithful
I was down to the wire
Hoping you’d come through
Then you stepped in the fire
Like you always do
Now I’m convinced of your love
You are more than enough
O God my Father
How great
Great is your faithfulness
Written by Steven Furtick

Cuando el peso del mundo

Eres fiel Dios

Phora performing Faithful
LYRICS :
[Hook]
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Aye, someone who understands
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Someone who understands
[Verse]
Yeah, you need someone to be faithful
You need somebody to save you
You need somebody who knows what you're worth
You don't need someone to change you
You need somebody to love you
You need somebody that trusts you
You need somebody who takes time
You don't need someone to rush you
I know you've been running from all these feelings
You just can't take it
Yeah, you've been trying to hide love
But when it's real love, you can't fake it
Look, I know what you've been through
So we can take our time and be patient
She gave her heart to me, made me promise not to go break it
But she never found what she was searching for
Yeah, you can tell by the smile on her face
She been hurt before
Look, I know your last man never put you first before
But you've been stressing less and you've been working more
I can tell you've been working more
Uh, too many late night "come throughs"
Not enough "I love yous"
She ain't really have real love in her life
And she feel like she might just lose it
But she don't know what's been missing
She just needs someone different
She just needs someone that she can run to
Someone that she can run to
[Hook]
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Aye, someone who understands
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Someone who understands
She just needs someone who's faithful

His smash hit “I’d Love You to Want Me” went No. 1 in almost every country. After touring globally for many years, Lobo now enjoys living a relatively quiet life with his wife, Susie.

Faithful by Lobo
LYRICS:
I never wanted anyone before
Half as much as I want you
I finally found what I've been searching for
My whole life through
You're the answer to the prayers I've prayed
More than I've ever dreamed of
So I give to you my heart today
And pledge my eternal love
I'll be faithful, faithful till the end
I'm so thankful that heaven
Chose to send you
And this love will last forever
Forever I'll be true
And be faithful to you
You're my one and only one you see
There's just no one to compare
I'll hold and keep you close to me
Way beyond our golden years
Our two hearts will always beat as one
One thing you can know for sure
I promise that I'll never let you down
Your trust in me's secure

Lyrics:
When I felt like the burden
Was more than I could hold
When the whispers of worry
Overwhelmed my soul
You never left me alone
You were there all along
You are faithful
Why should my heart be afraid
You are faithful
I know you’re not gonna change
You are faithful
Faithful
I was down to the wire
Hoping you’d come through
Then you stepped in the fire
Like you always do
Now I’m convinced of your love
You are more than enough
O God my Father
How great
Great is your faithfulness
Written by Steven Furtick
CCLI #: 7111926
Letras:
Cuando el peso del mundo
Caía sobre mí
Y mi alma abrumada
Temía el por venir
No te apartaste de mí
Siempre estabas allí
Eres fiel Dios
Mi corazón no temerá
Eres fiel Dios
Sé que nunca cambiarás
Eres fiel Dios
Fiel Dios
Yo quería rendirme
Mas esperé en Ti
Por el fuego cruzaste
Para llegar a mí
Seguro estoy en Tu amor
Bastarás mi Señor
Oh Dios mi Padre
Cuan Grande
Es Tu fidelidad
Oh Dios mi Padre
Cuan Grande
Es Tu fidelidad
Eres fiel Dios
Mi corazón no temerá
Eres fiel Dios
Sé que nunca cambiarás

All I know about this beautiful tune from the Philippines is that it is called Faithful love and is by Cesar Manalili and The Coronets. If anyone has any more information please let me know.
I was asked to do this beautiful song by Jose Doctolero.
So here is my interpretation of this beautiful Filipino song (OPM). I hope he, and you like it.
