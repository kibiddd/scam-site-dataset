is a web site about U.S. political history and cemeteries.
Founded in 1996, it is the Internet's most comprehensive free source
for American political biography, listing 338,260
politicians, living and dead.
The coverage of this site includes (1) the President, Vice President,
members of Congress, elected state and territorial officeholders in
all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories; and
the chief elected official, typically the mayor, of qualifying
municipalities; (2) candidates at election, including primaries, for
any of the above; (3) all federal judges and all state appellate
judges; (4) certain federal officials, including the federal cabinet,
diplomatic chiefs of mission, consuls, U.S. district attorneys,
collectors of customs and internal revenue, members of major
federal commissions; and political appointee (pre-1969) postmasters
of qualifying communities; (5) state and national political party
officials, including delegates, alternate delegates, and other
participants in national party nominating conventions;
(6) Americans who served as "honorary" consuls for other nations
before 1950. Note: municipalities or communities "qualify",
for Political Graveyard purposes, if they
have at least half a million person-years of history, inclusive of
predecessor, successor, and merged entities.
