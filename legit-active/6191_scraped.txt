Tori was interviewed by Sonia Benezra on the Quebec, Canada TV station MusiMax on November 18, 2002.  I am still looking for a transcript from this interview.  Here is a small report from Marie:
They talked aduring aproximately 30 minutes, about the album,
and Tori's relationship w/Mark, and about some other interesting
stuff... nothing really new, but some nice quotes (one about Tash
and the sun was really cute!)
