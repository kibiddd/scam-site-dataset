Did you know that if the water pipe leading from the curb to your house should leak or break, you are responsible for repairing it?
Has your water bill risen suddenly? Have you noticed a puddle developing in your yard for no apparent reason? If so, you may have a leaking or broken water line. Most people don't realize that this water line – which runs from the public water main on the street to their home or building is their responsibility. This line can range from 20 feet to more than 200 feet depending on your property. Over time, unpreventable environmental conditions may cause your water line to deteriorate and/or crack.
Water line failure occurs throughout the year, however, it is most common in the winter months when lines are subject to freezing temperatures. When a leaking or broken outdoor water pipe occurs, a rapid response can prevent thousands of dollars worth of water damage to your driveway, home or building. In addition, contaminated water has the potential of entering your home or building.
