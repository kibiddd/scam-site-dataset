She was 82. Norma, a native of Oakhurst, New Jersey, was discovered as a young teen at the Easter Parade on the Asbury Park boardwalk. Her striking beauty and rare eye colors—one blue, one brown—caught the attention of a New York photographer. His photographs launched her career as an international model and cover girl. Norma performed in early live radio and television dramas and later in featured roles on Dragnet (1959), Hogan's Heroes (1969), and other series. Her movie credits include Problem Girls (1953), Live Fast Die Young (1958), and a starring role in a film that has become a cult favorite, Return of Dracula (1958). She married French Resistance hero and actor Claude Dauphin in 1955. His prolific filmography includes April in Paris (1953), The Quiet American (1958), and Two for the Road (1967). The Dauphins divided their time between New York, Ocean Township, Hollywood, and Paris. Mr. Dauphin died in 1978. Norma remained loyal to her Monmouth County roots and was a founding member and honorary trustee of the Ocean Township Historical Museum. She is survived by her 107-year-old father, George Eberhardt of Chester, and six siblings. A celebration of Norma's life for friends, family, and fans will take place from 2 to 4, Sunday, September 25, at the Church House of the Presbyterian Church at Shrewsbury, 352 Sycamore Ave., Shrewsbury.

She was always there in her petite 65 street garden apartment .  Norma always loved hosting the most talented and accomplished celebs for her Sunday night " Poulet" dinners which she cooked in her petite kitchen.
