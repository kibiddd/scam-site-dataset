Pavillion Wing Winter Palace - Building noise?
16 years ago
Save
We have just had a letter from our tour operator to say that there is noise from the building works at the Pavillion Wing of the Winter Palace and asked if we want to change hotels. We are booked for a week from March 25th. Does anyone know how bad this is, or if there are some room numbers less likely to be affected?

We returned about a week ago. There was no evidence of building work to the Pavilion wing itself. Are they referring to the demolition of the nearby front block of the New Winter Palace?
The demolition seemed almost complete. They seemed to be tidying up.
If it is the demolition of the old block that they are referring to, then the rooms furthest into the site, i.e. nearest the pool, should be least effected.

Hi Weezy,
thanks for that little update. A couple of us here in the Luxor forum are going during the next couple of months and staying in the Pavillion, so it is great to hear if we should be worried about demolishing noise.
I have to say, though, that I have not heard that the demo of the front building should be of any problem from my travel agent. They did tell about the new building being torn down, but that the Pavillion was not affected by it in terms of noise. But I guess I'll just have to see for myself when I go there.

Thanks for that update Weezy - I'm going to the Pavilion in May and hope it's not going to be too disruptive. I've already e-mailed ahead and asked for the rooms that we want, so hopefully we'll be OK.
I did notice on our invoice from the travel company that all they said about building work was "Due to its popularity Egypt is still developing its infrastructure. Building work may be experienced in the vicinity of some hotels" So, no specific mention of the Winter Palace at all!! Luckily, because of TA, I know what's going on and can at least prepare for that and sort of know what to expect.
Any other updates though would be good.

Marlscat, LouiseAl
We are going to the Pavilion again, just after you.
Expect full report on the demolition/building situation!
Marlscat - did you get an answer from the WP re your e-mail?

Hello eLaReF
Oh yes, don't worry about that, there will be a full, frank and honest account given about the hotel (with photos) when I get back. I just hope they've got breakfast sorted out - I was really disappointed the last time I was there with lukewarm and almost inedible food both at breakfast and lunch. My husband broke a tooth eating chicken!! However, it's all about location rather than the food!!
Yes, I also got an e-mail confirming that they would try and give us the rooms that we want, so that's encouraging. If there's anything specific you want me to try and check out when I'm there, just let me know.

Thanks very much for that Wheezy. The letter says it is 'a property adjacent to the Pavillion' so may be the next door hotel? Apparently they are currently removing windows and balconies and the 'works are concentrating on pulling the structure down floor by floor'!! Looks like we will be the first out there so will report back to everyone at the beginning of April.

Hi madsummer
It would be great to get an up-to-date report from you when you come back. The adjacent property to the Pavilion your travel company are talking about will more than likely be the tower block that once was the New Winter Palace, which they were demolishing floor-by-floor by hand. The last report I saw on here was that the block had been entirely demolished, so I'm not sure now what's happening. It'll certainly be interesting to see fist hand what's going on when we get over there though.

It is the New Winter Palace that they are talking about.They have 3 Hotels that use the same gardens and swimming pool area.
1 The Old Winter Palace
2 The New Winter Palace
3 The Garden Pavillion Wing
Check the reviews and previous forums this may help you understand.
I would wear a safety hat& still wish to stay .

I agree with eLaReF - the gardens and pool area are like a little oasis in the middle of Luxor! The location is great and, even with the building/demolition work in progress, it's still our hotel of choice as well. Maybe I should look on eBay for a hard hat ...........

Hi Everyone
I've just had a reply to my email to the Winter Palace asking about the demolition and the charming Mr Mohamed sends 'greetings from sunny Luxor' and assures me that the building works are finished - so panic over! Thanks for all your helpful replies.
