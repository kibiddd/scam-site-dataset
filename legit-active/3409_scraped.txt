VITAPHONE Short Subject.A pair of dancing sweethearts carry on a private romance in a very public department store window.TIP TAP TOE is an enjoyable little film and serves primarily as a showcase for its incredibly lithe & limber young stars Hal LeRoy and Mitzi Mayfair, stars of the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931. The story is very silly, but agreeable, and the plot doesn't get too much in the way of the highly energetic duo.Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films.Ron OliverJul 10, 2003PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 22, 1932 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asBroadway Brevities (1932-1933 season) #4: Tip Tap ToeProduction companyVitaphone Inc.See more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime19 minutesColorBlack and WhiteAspect ratio1.37 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page
