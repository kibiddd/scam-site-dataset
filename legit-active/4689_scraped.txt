True Supporters Forevermore
Hearts on their sleeves and thousands of voices strong, the Timbers Army fills Providence Park with songs, scarves, flags and confetti. Their green-and-white energy flows onto the pitch anywhere the Portland Timbers play.
Part carnival, part mosh pit, part revival meeting, part Christmas morning, filled with people from every part of the community and every walk of life, the Timbers Army turns each game into a celebration of its love of Portland, of soccer, and of the Timbers.
If you like your sports passionate instead of passive – if you’re proud of the Rose City — if you appreciate the Beautiful Game – YOU are Timbers Army.
