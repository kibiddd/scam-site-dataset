Classic Celebrity Quote"I am now in a relationship that I never knew was even possible. I'm in love with my best friend who I shower with endless affection, talk to all times of the day and miss the moment I leave her side. I now understand what the women of my past desired from me. They INSTINCTIVELY KNEW that love actually looked this way! Everything from the hand holding to countless daily declarations of love were not only a byproduct of the man's emotions but it was something easily volunteered by the man who'd truly loved them. I simply didn't love my Ex's in the capacity their spirits knew organically needed to be loved. I believe woman nowadays have learned to settle for what's FAMILIAR to love."Who Said It »
