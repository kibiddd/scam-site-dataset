ceylon teaAlthough the cultivation of tea on a commercial scale in Ceylon began in 1867, the first tea seed was brought from China and planted in Ceylon nearly half a century earlier in 1824 at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya. In the meantime, indigenous tea was discovered in Upper Assam by Major Robert Bruce, and the Assam tea seed was later received at the Peradeniya Gardens in 1839.

27.01.2025Luxury Voices Part 1Hi, everyone. Welcome to Luxury Voices, the podcast about the luxury world in Asia with a focus on the greater China market. I am Joanne Tang, your host, founder and CEO of Infinite Luxury Group. In this podcast, we converse about all layers and segments of luxury, from lifestyle to travel and hospitality trends. I’ll interview key players of the luxury industry from all corners of the globe and talk about their initiatives and experiences in conquering the Asian luxury consumer, discover how leading luxury executives handle this growing market, where luxury spending is the highest in the world and gain a wealth of knowledge to harness this ever promising a luxury market.
Joining us today is Malik J Fernando, director of MJF holdings, and Dilmah Tea, which was established by Merrill J Fernando.

Three more resorts are currently under development. Today, I’m speaking with Malik about the destination, Sri Lanka, the challenges and opportunities for Resplendent Ceylon and what luxury means for the travellers’ post-COVID-19 and Malik himself. It is a great pleasure to have you here on Luxury Voices, Malik. How are you and how is the family?
27.01.2025The 10 best travel experiences in and around Galle, Ahangama and Weligama.While Southern Sri Lanka is known for its stunning coastline fringed with swaying coconut palms—along with adventure sports like surfing—there’s more to the South than its beaches. The region houses tea gardens (yes, you heard it right!), dense jungles with roaring cascades, paddy fields where peacocks roam, and slow-living villages with century-old cottage industries. Much of the island’s spices and herbs grow and flourish here, while generational artists work meticulously to keep their crafts alive. By the rugged shoreline, you’ll find fishermen on stilts, a decade-old practice, while the surrounding ocean is home to whales, dolphins and other marine life. So here are the 10 best travel experiences in and around Galle, Ahangama and Weligama beyond the South’s sunkissed shores.
