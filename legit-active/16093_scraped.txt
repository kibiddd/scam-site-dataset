This next tune is a tune off my last solo album.[crowd cheers] Don Henley: Wrote this Mr. Mike Campbell and our good friend J. D. Souther. Who, as you know, wrote a lot of the Eagles tunes with us. It took, uh, 42 years to write and about 4 minutes to sing, so...ConnectionsFeatured in The 47th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (1995)SoundtracksHotel CaliforniaWritten by Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Don FelderUser reviews15ReviewFeatured review10/10Just outstandingThis is one of the most outstanding concerts I have ever seen. One of the notable attributes of these artists is their versatility on different instruments. Looking at the lead in of the DVD we got the opportunity to see them key up the supporting musicians and literally find the off key instrument in the score. What an outstanding group of men. Is there a biography for the Eagles as a group? I think I saw another Eagle that Timothy B. Schmit replaced. I saw this when they were inducted into the Hall Of Fame. The new songs they developed, continue to show that these artists are not out of the main stream of the industry. Their popularity still soars with the EAGLES. Their voices are strong, in tune, and a virtual heaven sent talent.jrednc3Jul 21, 2005PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 26, 1994 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishFilming locationsWarner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USAProduction companiesGeffen Home VideoMusic Television (MTV)See more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 40 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoDTSAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Eagles: Hell Freezes Over (1994) in the United States?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
