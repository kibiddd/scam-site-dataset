In the beginning, he started to promote Outcast (heavy/power metal band from Pireaus port, in the veins of Accept and Saxon) 2nd demo tape. After that, he promoted Power Crue "Sign Of Rage" CD abroad, also Powerdrops debut CD. Since that moment, he started running a small distribution service supporting Hellenic bands abroad and also carrying a lot of foreign bands for the Hellenic Audience.
SECRET PORT RECORDS supported Power Crue "Stay Heavy" CD, Mystery "Tales..." CD and also lots of demo CDs from Hellenic bands such as Heaven's Spirits, Mutiny, Royal Quest, Insight, Outcast, Reflection, Windfall, Powerstorm, Lachrymal Gland, Brazen Faced, Crystal Tears, Fortress Under Siege, Guardian Angel and foreign acts like Battleheart (Hol), Wotan, Disarm Goliath, Rainspawn (Ita), Morifade, Powerdise (Swe), Phantom's Kiss, Savallion Dawn (D) and many others.
The list and fans of SECRET PORT RECORDS were growing day by day and Theodosis also contributed in several Hellenic publications such as Power Metal 'Zine, Seventh Sign, Steel Conjuring and a few foreign ones like Snakepit and United Forces from Germany, interviewing several Hellenic heavy metal bands like Power Crue, Powerdrops, Outcast, Mutiny and Marauder, while he had also taken a small participation on Stefan Riermaier's metal book "Heavy Metal From South Europe".
After all these actions and several attendance in order to promote Hellenic heavy metal all around the world, in January 2001 it was time for SECRET PORT RECORDS to get serious and official.
It all started with SECRET PORT's mini-CD release of Dream Weaver (great epic/power metal from Hellas) "Fantasy Revealed". This band was supported and featured with one track in a compilation CD of Metal Invader magazine Hellas and that was the kick start for Theodosis to release these 5 magnificent heavy metal compositions.
In March of 2001, after an agreement with Stathis "Thunderchild" Pavlantis, a contract with Reflection took place. The band get in the studio and re-recorded all the classic Reflection tunes plus two new tracks and a new cover artwork. The CD "The Fire Still Burns..." was the 2nd release for SECRET PORT RECORDS. Pure classic Hellenic epic metal!!!!!!!
The 3rd release was a matter of time for the label. After 2 failed agreements for a 7" release, the young and very promising doom metal band Violet Vortex, signed a contract with SECRET PORT RECORDS. They entered the Reflection Studio in August 2001 and the CD of pure doom metal with title "Lure Elegant" released in September of the same year. The CD received very well reviews and sold 1000 copies within 3 months!!!!!! This release is a limited edition of 2000 copies plus a video live track!!!!!!
Later on SECRET PORT, a limited picture vinyl edition of Reflection "The Fire Still Burns..."  was released in December 2001.
The year 2002 came with a triple release of Black Fate Greece "Uncover" CD (great progressive metal), Saqqara "Tristeza" CD... demo edition limited 1000 copies and Hourglass "Journey Through Infinity" (great epic/speed/power metal) with great reviews!!!!!!!
All these CDs were released in March /April 2002 and had great acceptance by fans and mail-order shops from all over the world...
In the mean time, a deal for a limited 1000 copies release for both demos of a great doom metal band from Germany Well Of Souls has been made...
Later on SECRET PORT continued its activities with the release of Rivera Bomma "Invisible Force" hard 'n' heavy rock straight from the US.
In early 2003 Thedore Ziras (one on Greece's - and no only -best guitarists) releases his 2nd album "Virtual Virtuosity" through SECRET PORT. Fantastic Neoclassical Metal that really shook the waters in the "guitar world". A few months later, Reflection sign a new contract with SECRET PORT in order to release their latest album entitled "Odyssey", one of the best epic/doom records ever released! The same year in early summer SECRET PORT releases the first full length album of the Prog/Power metallers Dream Weaver entitled ?Words Carved Within?.
During 2004, SECRET PORT brings to light two more albums. The one should be Mike Di Marelli Artical ?Fantasy?, great neoclassical metal in the veins of Yngwie Malm.& Vinnie Moore and the other is Lost Fate?s ?Where Dreams? Have No End?, an album full of power, melody and emotion!
SECRET PORT is marching on and the next two releases for 2005 are going to be Dimitris Panatazis WAYFARER ?Cyngus X-1? (instrumental) and Feanor?s Invisible (Heavy/Power Metal).S.P.R.
