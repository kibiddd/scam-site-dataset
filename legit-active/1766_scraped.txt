Beloved husband of Paula (nee Hershorin) and of the late Marcia (nee Klienman), long time resident of Philadelphia and Erdenheim PA. Dear father of Fred (Kristine) and Ken (Cindy); grandfather; great grandfather; brother to Toby Brandes (Sy) and the late Herman (the late Arlene). Bernie was a graduate of University of Pennsylvania with honors at the age of 19. Scholastically he skipped 2 grades and was a proud member of Mensa. During World War II he proudly served the Navy in Guam as a radioman. He worked at NAVSSES for over 35 years where he achieved one of the top civilian positions and was awarded two patents as the inventor, at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. From there he worked for 10 years at American Electronics Labora-tory. Bernie and Paula travelled the world before and after his retirement. The Phillies and Eagles were his favorite teams, and he rarely missed a game. During his life his many friends knew him as being clever, charitable and possessing a great sense of humor. Rarely did a time go by where he was not at the center of attention recanting his stories about the war, his childhood or his many pranks. Bernie was very intelligent, well read and was not afraid to express himself. He was very close to, and proud of his children and grandchildren. Married to Marcia for 23 years before she passed on, Bernie met and married Paula whom he adored. Ultimately, he succumbed to Mesothelioma which he acquired from his work at the Naval Shipyard. Relatives and friends will be invited to a private Memorial Service by the family. In leiu of flowers, memorial contribu-tions can be sent to the World Wildlife Fund at www.worldwildlife.org/donate
