1) We are enhancing our HSBC HK App and Online Banking with additional security controls, please make sure your email address and mobile number are up to date in our records to receive both notifications via email and SMS after conducting certain transactions. If you don't have a valid email address and mobile number before Aug 2023, you will be blocked to conduct some of the transactions on Digital banking. Learn more.
2) New safety measure for Android device: Beware of apps from sources other than your phone’s official app stores which may contain malware. From 26 Feb 2024, new safety measure in the Android version of the HSBC HK App will be launched to protect you from malware. Learn more.
3) Beware of cheque scams. Fraudsters may deposit invalid cheques to claim that you have been paid, as reflected in the increased ‘ledger balance‘ in your account. Cheque deposit takes 1 to 2 working days for clearance. Always check your ‘available balance‘ to confirm the payment is completed. Learn more.
4) HSBC Reminder: If you've lost your Credit/Debit card or believe it might have been stolen or misused, you can temporarily suspend it via the HSBC HK Mobile Banking App or HSBC Online Banking. You can also unblock it when you think it’s safe or recovered.
5) When processing any cash transactions, we may ask for transaction details and supporting documents. This better protects you from fraud and defends the integrity of the financial system. We’ll keep all information and required documents confidential and use it to understand the transaction only.
