The movie's one genuine tragedy is so obviously announced and reannouced that you get tired waiting for it to happen.

"Beyond Silence" is a film about a deaf couple's difficulty to connect with their two children who are able to hear. The main character is the oldest child, Lara, who develops a talent and passion for the clarinet despite her parents being unable to hear, and thus not supporting her in her music education.
Lara has a very close relationship with her parents but after she begins to play the clarinet she grows away from them. They cannot understand her passion, and she remains angry at their inability to support her talent. Her aunt is in contrast, able to hear, and is a professional clarinet player. Since she is the one who gave Lara a clarinet and supported her the two become close despite the aunt not consistently being there for her. This closeness is shown in the cinematography capturing the two in similar positions or using similar hand gestures. One scene in particular when the two were in Berlin (for Lara to apply to a music school) shows them side by side in a car where a frame within a frame technique was used that really conveys Lara's imitation of her aunt. This relationship feels like a betrayal to the father since he and his sister do not get along. They both resent each other for receiving special treatment as children and also were unable to form a bond since one was deaf and the other was not.
This story is an alternative coming of age story for a family that struggles to connect; however the film also comments on society and their disconnect to handicapped people. For example, when Lara's grandmother comments on Germany's historical prejudice against sign language when she says "If I hadn't listened to that pighead, my hands might be able to fly, too.'' referring to never learning her own son's language.
"Beyond Silence" attempts to capture the everyday hardships of the deaf community while crafting an important message on the universal family dynamics, and importance to try and understand in order to retain a strong bond of love despite physical differences.

You might not believe it's so real, but I speak from experience as a hearing child of a deaf parent, I've experienced all those scenes of translation, fights with my dad, etc.  Love it.

Worthy of its Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film that year.

The stakes are so low that it's hard to get involved, even if the movie itself is perfectly competent otherwise.

Stunningly photographed with beautiful musical performances, 'Beyond Silence'  lacks a gripping script and the top-notch acting that it needs to make it a real winner. A little disappointing but still watchable.
