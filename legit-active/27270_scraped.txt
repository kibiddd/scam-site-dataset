Breeding for QualityOutstanding Genetics. Data-Driven Breeding Decisions. Stellar Results.
Every breeder appreciates recognition for their breeding program. We make our breeding decisions carefully, using top stud males and females. We gather data from a variety of sources to help us determine the best breeding matches on our farm. ​Histograms give us information about fiber fineness, consistency, and comfort factor. We use information from the Suri Herd Improvement Program (SHIP) to identify strengths and weakness of each animal in both fiber and conformation.  We also show our young animals at alpaca shows to see how they stack up to other high quality alpacas and to get feedback from professional alpaca judges.
Industry Involvement
Alpacas are relatively new in the United States compared to other livestock. We are committed to the industry's growth and future, and accordingly, we are members of the Alpaca Owners Association (AOA) and a number of affiliates.
