NOTICE.
The  favor  with  which  the  First  Edition  of  the  Parlia-
mentary and  Departmental  Hand  Book  was  received,  has
induced  the  Compiler  to  issue  a  Second  one.  Some  very
important  additions  have  been  made,  and  the  whole  carefully
revised  and  corrected.  The  amount  of  information  it  con-
tains cannot  fail  to  be  useful  to  persons  having  business  to
transact  with  Parliament  or  the  Departments,  and  interesting
to  those  who  have  not  yet  had  an  opportunity  to  visit
Ottawa  and  the  Government  Buildings.
Entered,  according  to  the  Act  of  the  Provincial  Parliament,  in  the  year  one
thousand  eight  hundred  and  sixty-eight,  by  Joseph  Bureau,  in  the  Office  of
the  Registrar  of  Canada.

OTTAWA   CITY.
BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  CHIEF  FEATURES  OF
OTTAWA  CITY.
Though  the  present  "Hand  Book"  was  designed  cluefly  with  the
view  of  furnishing  tourists  with  a  detailed  description  of  tiie  Par-
liament and  Departmental  Buildings  of  the  Dominion  of  Canada,  the
Compiler  has  thought  it  as  well  to  offer,  at  the  same  time,  a  brief
notice  of  the  principal  features  of  interest  in  the  City  of  Ottawa  itself,
and  the  surrounding  neighborhood.
No  stranger  can  fail  to  be  struck  at  a  glance  with  the  many  na-
tural advantages  that  the  City  of  Ottawa  possesses  both  of  beauty  and
utility,  and  a  closer  acquaintance  with  the  locale  more  than  confirms
the  first  impression.
Something  seems  to  have  inspired  its  founders  with  a  prophetic
vision  of  its  destiny  as  the  future  Capital  of  the  Dominion,  for  it
appears  from  the  first  to  have  been  laid  out  on  an  immense  scale.
Its  principal  streets  are  of  great  width  and  extend  from  East  to
West  nearly  three  miles,  and  throughout  the  whole  of  these,  the
meaner  buildings  are  being  gradually  displaced  by  erections  worthy
of  the  large  thoroughfares  upon  which  they  are  situated.
The  limits  of  the  City  do  not  at  present  extend  more  than  half  a
mile  back  from  the  Ottawa  River  frontage,  but  its  natural  and  ulti-
mate limits  are  evidently  destined  to  extend  to  the  Rideau  Canal,
which  together  with  the  Rideau  River  in  the  rear,  and  the  Ottawa
River  in  its  front,  will  enclose  the  City  site  in  a  Peninsula,  the  area  of
which  will  be  three  miles  long  by  three  miles  broad,  afl'ording  room
for  a  Cily  population  of  the  largest  class.  The  beautiful  new  gravel
road  just  finished  running  from  Wellington  street  to  the  Rideau
Canal  which  it  crosses  by  a  swing  Bridge,  affords  an  excellent  guage
for  the  future  breadth  of  Ottawa  City,  north  and  south.  It  is  called
Gloucester  Road  and  runs  through  the  property  of  W.  Powell,  Esq.,
Sherilf  of  Carleton,  and  is  already  being  taken  up  by  Merchants,
Govermnent  Officials  and  others  desiring  suburban  residences,  and
is  resorted  to  as  a  favorite  drive.  This  may  be  pronounced  by  some
a  "Day-Dream"  but  Ottawa  has  already  realized  more  wonderful
dreams  than  this,  for  it  is  said  that  the  farm  on  which  the  City  now
stands  was  sold  37  years  ago  for  Eighty  pounds  Currency,  and  surely
_

OTTAWA   CITY.
the  ratio  between  that  sum' and  its  present  vahie,  is  as  marvellous  a
fact  as  anything  we  can  dream  of  for  Ottawa's  future,  when  the
Ottawa  and  Huron  Canal  shall  have  been  completed,  and  when
Ottawa  may  boast  of  being  not  only  the  Legislative  Capital,  but  the
chief  seal  of  the  Manufactures  of  the  Dominion.
THE   SCENERY   OF  OTTAWA.
Ottawa  City  lies  on  the  right  bank  or  south  shore  of  the  Ottawa
River,  and  may  be  said  to  extend  from  the  Chaudiere  Falls  to  RockclitFe,
a  distance  of  about  three  miles.  Nothing  can  be  more  striking  than
the  tableau  presented  by  this  Ottawa  River  frontage  of  the  City  as
viewed  from  the  River  or  from  the  low  shore  of  the  opposite  bank.
The  whole  length  preseits  a  succession  of  bold  promontories  or
blufPs,  many  of  them  rising  perpendicularly  250  feet  from  the  waters
edge,  clothed  with  a  perpetual  green  of  bushy  cedar  and  pine,  and
separated  from  each  other  by  small  bays.
nOCKCLlFFE.
Ascending  the  river  the  firstof  these  promontories  which  presents
itself  is  known  by  the  name  of  Rockcliffe,  the  property  of  Dr.  Hunter,
its  frontage  extends  about  a  quarter  of  a  mile,  and  through  its  whole
length  on  the  side  of  the  clifT  runs  a  magnificent  Terrace  or  Alley,
sufficiently  wide  for  a  Carriage  Road,  and  so  thickly  shaded  through-
out by  tall  pine  trees  and  cedar  bushes  as  to  be  impervious  alike  to
the  fierce  summer  sun  and  the  chilly  blasts  of  winter.  The  view
obtained  here  of  the  opposite  shore,  wherever  an  opening  can  be
found,  is  perhaps  more  beautiful  (as  it  is  more  extensive)  than  from
any  of  the  other  promontories,  the  eye  here  embraces  not  only  the
pastoral  landscape  of  grassy  slopes  and  cultivated  fields,  backed  by  the
distant  mountains  of  Lower  Canada,  but  a  clear  view  sixteen  miles
down  the  Ottawa  River.
THE  RmEAU  FALLS.
The  next  striking  object  met  with  is  the  Rideau  River  tumbling
perpendicularly  into  the  Ottawa  River  on  either  side  of  a  low  flat
island  making  two  distinct  falls  of  about  40  feet  high.
major's  hill — BARRACK   HILL   AND   THE   PARLIAMENT  BUILDINGS.
Major's  Hill  and  Barrack  Hill  are  ihe  two  next  promontories, — the
first  is  at  present  used  as  a  Public  Park, — the  latter  which  is  the  glory
of  Ottawa  is  crowned  by  the  magnificent  new  Parliament  Buildings,

fully  described  in  another  place.  In  the  Bay  between  these  two
promontories  is  situated  the  entrance  to  the  massive  Locks  of  the
Rideau  Canal,  an  expensive  Imperial  work  which  intersects  the  City
and  joins  the  Rideau  River.  The  old  and  respectable  firm  of
Dickinson  h  Co.,  run  a  line  of  freight  and  passenger  steamers  from
the  City  of  Ottawa  to  Kingston  through  this  Canal.
CHAUOIERE    FALLS.
These  falls  (spanned  by  the  suspension  bridge  which  unites  the
provinces  of  Ontario  and  Quebec,)  though  always  interesting,  and
probably  more  remarkable  in  their  eccentricity  than  any  other  falls
in  the  known  world,  must  be  viewed  at  two  different  seasons  of  the
year  to  be  properly  appreciated.
First. — In  the  Spring  when  the  Ottawa  is  receiving  the  swollen
waters  of  its  numerous  tributaries  and  when  it  is  said  to  be  discharg-
ing as  great  a  volume  of  water  as  Niagara  itself :  on  thes(»  occasions
the  foaming  and  resistless  rush  of  the  turbulent  torrent  fascinates  the
observer  and  chains  him  in  bewilderment  to  the  spot.
Secondly. — In  mid  Winter  when  the  outer  waters  of  the  falls  are
frozen  into  the  most  fantastic  forms — in  some  places  assiuniiig  the
appearance  of  different  kinds  of  drapery,  from  the  heavy  curtain  to
the  most  transparent  lace  veil :  in  other  places  looking  like  the  fret-
work of  some  elaborate  marble  altar  screen.

,  RIDEAU    HALL.
Rideau  Hall  is  the  residence  of  His  Excellency  the  Governor
General.  The  house  is  a  substantial  stone  building  without  archi-
tectural pretensions.  A  handsome  new  wing  of  fine  proportions  has
been  recently  added,  containing  a  spacious  reception  room,  and  a  suite
of  apartments  on  a  suitable  scale,  and  fitted  with  all  the  conveniences
of  an  English  gentleman's  residence.  It  has  been  newly  iiirnished
throughout  partly  by  Messrs.  Jacques  tSi  Hay,  of  Toronto,  and  partly
by  Mr.  Drum,  of  Quebec,  at  an  expense  of  about  $i?G,()00.
Both  these  eminent  firms  have  had  an  opportunity  at  Rideau
Hall  of  displaying  the  beauty  and  excellence  which  the  art  of  Up-
holstery has  attained  in  Canada,  and  we  venture  to  atlirni  that  nothing
more  elegant  in  side-boards,  sofas,  chairs,  and  bed-room  suits  cuuld
have  been  turned  out  either  in  London  or  Paris.
The  house  stands  in  about  thirty-five  a(;res  of  ground  well  laid
out,  and  is  approached  through  a  handsome  avenue  of  well  grown
trees.

MANUFACTURING  PROGRESS.
The  Staple  Trade  of  Ottawa,  as  is  well  known,  is  the  manufacture
of  Lumber ;  and  all  the  Saw  Mills  round  the  Chaudiere  Falls  on  both
sides  of  the  River,  as  well  as  at  the  Rideau  Falls,  are  in  the  hands  of
enterprizing  Firms  from  the  United  States,  who  are  driving  a  most
extensive  business  in  Sawed  Lumber,  but  the  prize  for  enterprize  and
progress  must  be  awarded  to  E.  B.  Eddy,  Esq.  This  gentleman,  it
appears,  came  to  Ottawa  about  eleven  years  ago,  possessing  nothing
but  the  ingenuity  and  indomitable  energy  so  characteristic  of  his
countrymen  ;  to-day  his  works  at  the  Village  of  Hull,  (which  is,  after
all,  but  a  suburb  of  the  City  of  Ottawa,)  cover  25  acres  of  ground.
They  consist  of  two  large  saw  mills,  running  240  lumber  saws,  a
barrel,  pail  and  match  manufactory,  all  built  in  the  most  substantial
manner  and  probably  superior  in  their  machinery  and  improvements
to  any  similar  establishment  in  the  world.  Eddy's  Matches,  it  appears,
have  been  proved  to  be  the  most  reliable  of  any  in  the  market  and  are
not  only  esteemed  in  America  but  are  largely  exported  to  Europe.
We  have  no  space  to  describe  in  detail  the  economy  of  this  establish-
ment, but  the  reader  may  form  some  idea  of  the  extent  of  its  operations,
when  we  state,  that  a  good  sized  village  population  of  1200  people —
men,  women,  and  children — is  employed  by  Mr.  Eddy's  enterprize.
The  employment  of  the  Ottawa  River  Water  Power,  may,  how-
ever, bfl  said  to  be  only  at  its  commencement,  as  the  Government
intend  to  stretch  a  Dam  across  the  River  above  the  Chaudiere  Falls ;  we
may  therefore,  in  due  time,  expect  to  see  Cotton,  Woollen  and  other
Manufactures  established  here.
Among  the  general  improvements  finished  and  progressing  in
Ottawa  and  its  suburbs  we  may  notice
THE   RESmENCE   OF   J.   M.   CURRIER,    ESQ.
On  the  Ottawa  River,  in  front  of  Rideau  Hall,  Mr.  Currier,  the
Member  of  the  Commons  for  the  City,  has  nearly  completed  a  beautiful
house  on  the  Bluff  next  to  RockclilFe.  The  design  is  Modern  Gothic
in  Grey  Lime  Stone  with  Cut  Stone  Dressings,  the  Chimneys,  Windows,
Doors  and  other  stone  finishings  are  beautifully  executed.  Its  interior
is  fitted  with  Water  Tank,  heating  apparatus.  Baths,  &c.,  all  on  the
newest  principle ;  in  the  grounds  is  a  beautiful  vinery,  the  road
frontage  has  a  fine  Lawn  shaded  by  large  Oak  and  Pine  Trees.  On
tlie  whole  this  is  a  perfect  Gem  of  Domestic  Architecture.  On  the
extreme  edge  of  the  Bluff  and  commanding  a  view  of  similar  scenery
to  that  seen  from  Rockcliffe  is  an  elegant  and  capacious  Double
Storied  Summer  House.
OTTAWA   CITV.

Daly  street  is  supposed  to  be  the  West  End  or  olh  Avenue  District
of  Ottawa.  The  Upper  ten  of  Government  Oflieials  liave  located  here
and  hero  also  several  of  the  Merchants  of  the  City  have  erected  pretty
residences.
niDES   AND   DRIVES.
In  beautiful  rides  and  drives  the  neighborhood  of  Ottawa  can
scarcely  be  excelled — a  nine  mile  drive  up  the  Gatineau  Road  and
through  Chelsea  conducts  the  tourist  to  the  Mountain  Range  which
forms  such  a  conspicuous  object  in  the  scenery  viewed  from  the  City
of  Ottawa.  In  these  mountains  are  to  be  found  several  lovely
valleys — with  cultivated  farms;  and  Lakes  teeming  with  Trout.
CHURCHES  AND   OTHER   BUILDINGS.
Ottawa  is  somewhat  behind  in  Ecclesiastical  Architecture.  The
population  is  half  Roman  Catholic  and  half  Protestant.  The  former
have  a  handsome  Cathedral,  and  St.  Joseph's  Church  attached  to  St.
Joseph's  College  is  a  neat  structure,  more  elegant  in  its  interior  than
in  its  exterior  design.  The  Revd.  Dr.  Jones,  on  Daly  Street,  and  the
Revd.  J.  J.  Johnson,  both  popular  preachers  of  the  English  Episcopal
Church  have  been  enabled  by  their  respective  Congregations  to  erect
recently  neat  little  Gothic  Churches  holding  400  or  500  people  each,
but  from  some  cause  or  other  there  is  no  English  Episcopal  Church
worthy  of  the  place,  nor  any  present  prospect  of  so  desirable  an
addition  to  Ottawa's  Ecclesiastical  Buildings.
Of  other  erections  which  have  struck  us  as  examples  worthy  of
imitation  by  their  fellow  citizens,  we  may  mention  the  handsome
block  of  Brick  Stores  on  Sussex  St.,  erected  by  Ilis  Lordship  the  R.
C.  Bishop  of  Ottawa, — the  Oflices  of  Messrs.  Hamilton, — Desbarats
Government  Printing  Office  and  Block.— The  Quebec  Bank  which
besides  its  handsome  exterior  has  recentlv  received  internal  deco-
rations  of  great  beauty  both  of  design  and  execution — the  handsome
and  commodious  New  Wing  in  cut  stone  added  to  the  Russell  Hotel
by  D.  McLaughlin,  Blsq.,  M.  P.
The  population  of  Ottawa  is  supposed  now  to  have  attained  to
25,000.

GOVERNMENT   DUILDINGS.
THE   GOVERNMENT   BUILDINGS.
Ottawa  having  been  selected  by  Her  Majesty,  as  the  Capital  of
Canada,  the  sum  of  £75,000  was  voted  by  the  Legislative  Assembly,
for  the  erection  of  a  Parliament  House,  and  a  premium  of  $1000  offered
for  the  best  design  not  to  exceed  that  amount,  Messrs.  Fuller  &  Jones
were  the  successful  architects,  and  although  the  design  was  consi-
dered by  many  as  too  costly,  responsible  contractors  were  found  who
tendered  within  the  government  vote.  Upon  examination,  however,
of  the  spot  selected  for  the  erection,  formerly  known  as  the  Barrack
Hill,  it  was  found  from  the  inequality  of  the  ground,  that  immense  exca-
vations were  necessary,  which  made  in  solid  rock  added  enormously
to  the  original  cost,  and  could  not  have  been  foreseen  by  builders  nor
architects.  The  government  finding  no  provision  for  this  work  in
the  grant,  and  fearing  it  would  cost  a  large  portion  of  the  original
sum  voted ^  stopped  works,  and  for  some  considerable  time  there  was
no  progress.  A  commission  of  inquiry  was  appointed,  fresh  contracts
were  signed,  and  the  whole  of  the  works  placed  under  the  superin-
tendence of  Mr.  Fuller,  under  whose  management  the  present  highly
creditable  structures  have  been  completed.  The  corner  stone  was
laid  with  great  ceremony  by  His  Royal  Highness  the  Prince  of  Wales,
in  September,  1860,  on  which  occasion  the  rejoicings  partook  of  the
nature  of  the  place,  the  lumber  arches  and  men  being  a  novelty  to  most
of  its  visitors,  bullocks  and  sheep  were  roasted  whole  upon  the  govern
ment  ground  and  all  comers  were  feasted.  The  site  of  these  buildings
has  been  very  happily  selected  in  the  most  elevated  part  of  the  city;
they  consist  of  the  Parliament  and  two  Departmental  Buildings,
forming  three  sides  of  a  large  square,  facing  the  city,  and  from  their
position  overlooking  most  of  the  houses.  In  the  rear  of  the  Parlia-
ment Building  the  rock  descends  almost  perpendicularly  to  the  river
Ottawa  ;  from  here  the  view  is  truly  magnificent,  and  cannot  be  sur-
passed on  this  continent  nor  in  Europe.  The  broad  river  is  in  itself
a  beautiful  object,  but  the  vast  extent  of  distant  forest  and  hill  com-
pletely absorbs  every  attention.  From  this  point  the  Chaudiere  Falls
are  distinctly  seen,  and  by  some  considered  more  romantic  than

thoso  of  Niagara  ;  beyond  can  be  traced  tlio  island-dotted  r.ipids
of  the  Upper  Ottawa.  This  river  must  be  always  intorestinf;
on  account  of  its  slides,  booms,  and  distinctive  race  of  luml)ermen  ;  it
is  only  seen  however  to  its  full  advantajje  in  the  spring  of  the  year,
with  high  water,  crowded  with  rafts.  The  j,M-oup  of  buildings  form
a  most  picturesque  object  from  every  approach  to  the  city,  and  can
be  seen  at  a  great  distance.
The  Parliament  Buildings  stand  on  a  high  plateau  of  some  30
acres  in  area.  The  buildings  form  three  sides  of  a  quadrangular
figure,  and  are  widely  detached.  The  Parliament  or  main  building
facing  Wellington  street ;  and  the  Departmental  Buildings  lacing
inwards  to  the  square  and  forming  the  other  two  sides  of  the  figure.
The  splendour  of  those  Buildings,  their  fine  commanding  site,
together  with  the  beauty  of  the  surrounding  scenery,  place  them  in  a
very  enviable  position — compared  with  all  other  structures  used  for
similar  purposes  on  this  continent,  and  some  say,  even  in  Kurope —
and  must  ever  make  them  objects  of  interest  to  the  tourist  and  the
stranger.
The  stvle  of  the  Buildings  is  the  Gothic  of  the  12th  and  13th
Genturie:^,  with  modification  to  suit  the  climate  of  Ganada.  The  orna-
mental work  and  the  dressing  round  the  windows  are  of  Ohio  sand-
stone. The  plain  surface  is  faced  with  a  cream-colored  sandstone  of
the  Potsdam  formation,  obtained  from  Nepean,  a  few  miles  from
Ottawa.  The  spandrils  of  the  arches,  and  the  spaces  between  window-
arches  and  the  sills  of  the  upper  windows,  are  filled  up  with  a  quaint
description  of  stone-work,  composed  of  stones  of  irregular  size,  shape
and  colour,  very  neatly  set  together.  These  w-ith  the  Potsdam  red
sandstone  employed  in  forming  the  arches  over  the  windows,  afibrd
a  pleasant  variety  of  colour  and  effect,  and  contrast  with  the  general
masses  of  light  coloured  sandstone,  of  which  the  body  of  the  work  is
composed.
This  Building,  as  you  approach  from  Wellington  street,  presents
a  very  imposing  appearence.  The  central  of  the  seven  towers,  which
is  very  rich  in  design,  projects  its  width  from  the  front  of  the  Build-
ing, and  when  completed,  will  be  about  180  ft.  high.  The  body  of
the  building  in  front  is  forty  feet  high,  above  which  rises  the  slanting
roofs  of  slate,  surmounted  by  lines  of  ornamental  iron  cresting.  The
building  is  472  feet  long  ;  and  the  depth  from  the  front  of  the  main
tower  to  the  rear  of  the  library  is  570  feet,  covering  an  area  of  82,886
superficial  feet.  It  stands  at  a  distance  of  600  feet  from  Wellington
street,  so  that  the  quadrangle  formed  on  three  sides  by  the  Buildings
and  on  the  fourth  by  the  street,  is  700  feet  from  east  to  west,  and
600  feet  from  north  to  south  ;  thus  affording  a  very  spacious  square.

GOVERNMENT   BUILDINGS.
The  ground  upon  which  the  buildings  stand  varies  somewhat  in  ele-
vation, that  forming  the  site  of  the  Parliament  Building  being  the
highest.  The  basement  floor  of  the  buildings  is  assumed  to  be  IGO
feet  above  the  ordinary  summer  level  of  the  river,  while  that  of  the
Eastern  and  Western  blocks  is  135  and  142  feet  respectively.  The
increased  elevation,  however,  improves  very  much  the  general  effect
of  the  buildings.
The  main  entrance  is  through  the  principal  tower,  the  spacious
arches  of  which  admit  of  a  carriage  way  under  them.  The  piers  which
support  the  tower  are  ornamented  with  pillars  of  polished  Arnprior
marble.  Passing  through  it  we  enter  a  large  hall,  paved  with  tiles,
and  also  surrounded  with  marble  pillars.  Ascending  and  moving
towards  the  left  we  come  to  the  Chamber  of  Commons.  The
Room  measures  82  by  45  feet,  the  ceiling  being  over  50  feet
high,  and  formed  of  fine  open  work.  The  skylights  above  this  inter-
mediate ceiling,  with  the  stained  glass  windows  at  the  sides,  throw
a  plentiful  soft  light  over  the  whole  place.  The  room  is  surrounded
by  large  piers  of  a  light  greyish  marble  from  Portage  du  Fort,  sur-
mounted just  above  the  galleries  by  clusters  of  small  pillars  of  the
dark  Arnprior  ;  the  arches  supported  by  these  pillars  being  again  of
the  light  coloured  marble.  The  galleries  can  accommodate  about
1,000  persons.  The  Gallery  for  the  Reporters  is  situated  above  the
Speaker's  chair.
On  the  right  of  the  Main  entrance,  is  the  Senate  Chamber,  alike  in
every  particular  to  that  of  the  Commons.  Along  the  Corridors  you
see  numerous  Rooms  for  Committees,  Clerks,  Reading  and  Smoking.
Although  the  Library  is  not  yet  completed,  we,  nevertheless,
give  >iere  a  sketch  of  what  is  intended  to  be  done.  The  library  will
be  situated  in  the  rear  of  the  Parliament  Building,  and  the  plan  is  of
a  polygon  of  sixteen  sideo,  ?^  feet  in  diameter  ;  outside  of  the  main
room  is  an  aisle  of  one  story  high,  which  is  formed  of  a  series  of
small  retiring  rooms,  where  persons  desiring  a  few  hours  of  uninter-
rupted study  can  secure  it.  A  corridor  will  connect  the  Library  with
the  main  building :  this  corridor  will  be  the  picture  gallery,
but  is  at  present  used  for  the  Library.  The  floors  of  this  building,
as  well  as  those  of  the  Departmental  Buildings,  are  made  of  concrete,
perfectly  fire-proof  ;  an  invention  not  long  adopted  in  Europe.
The  Eastern  Block  of  the  Departmental  Buildings  is  of  an  irre-
gular and  picturesque  shape.  The  west  front  or  that  which  faces  the
square,  is  318  feet,  and  253  feet  on  the  south  front  or  that  which
faces  Wellington  street,  and  cover  an  area  of  41,840  superficial  feet.
In  this  building  are  found  the  Governor  General's  Oflice,  the  Privy
Council  room,  the  Minister  of  Justice,  the  Minister  of  Militia,  the
GOVERNMENT   BUILDINGS.
15
Secretary  of  State,  the  Finance  and  Audit  Offices,  the  Registrar,  the
Receiver  General,  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Provinces,  the
Customs  and  the  Inland  Revenue  departments.
From  the  east  side  of  this  building  an  extensive  view  is  obtained,
embracing  the  lower  town  and  the  country  beyond  it.  Nearer  is  a
plateau,  somewhat  similar  to  that  upon  which  stand  the  buildings,
and  known  as  the  Major's  Hill,  and  in  a  deep  hollow  between  and
immediately  under  the  walls,  is  the  long  chain  of  Locks  of  the  Rideau
Canal,  famous  for  its  workmanship  and  solidity,  spanned,  a  little
higher  up,  by  the  Sappers'  bridge,  connecting  the  lower  town  with
upper  and  central  towns.
The  Western  Block  is  similar  in  style  to  that  of  the  Eastern
block,  but  not  quite  so  large  and  more  regular  in  its  contruction,
being  211  feet  long,  facing  the  square,  and  277  feet  on  the  south
looking  on  Wellington  street.  It  is  also  very  imposing,  although  not
possessing  so  grand  an  entrance  as  the  Eastern  block,  a  circumstance
which  is  probably  accounted  for  by  the  fact  of  the  Governor  Ge-
neral and  Privy  Council's  rooms  being  situated  in  the  first  described
block.  The  Public  Works  Department,  the  Post  Office  Department,
the  Adjutant  General  and  Militia  Departments,  the  Marine  and
Fisheries  Department,  the  Bureau  of  Agriculture,  and  the  model  room
connected  with  the  Patent  Department,  are  all  located  in  this  building.
The  west  front  of  this  building  looking  upon  the  upper  town  and
beyond  it  towards  the  Chaudiere  Falls,  and  Hull,  gives  a  fine  view  of
the  wooded  lands  on  the  shore  of  the  Ottawa  River  and  the  distant
range  of  hills  beyond,  includinr^  a  far  view  of  the  river  and  its  banks
stretching  to  the  south-west  in  the  direction  of  Aylmer.  Similar  or
still  more  extensive  views  are  obtained  from  the  west  side  of  the
Parliament  Building.
The  ceiling  of  the  passages  and  of  many  of  the  rooms  of  the  Par-
liament Buildings  are  made  of  pine  wood,  varnished,  which  being
wrought  into  ornamental  cornices  and  panels  produces  a  rich  and
very  fine  appearence.  The  same  material  has  been  used  for  the  doors.
The  fillings  around  the  grates  and  mantle-pieces  are  of  polished  Arn-
prior  marble  ;  it  is  greyish  blue  marble  of  very  fine  grain,  and
capable  of  being  polished  to  a  high  degree.  All  the  floors  are  sup-
ported by  rolled  iron  girders,  and  filled  in  between  with  cement.
The  stairs  in  the  buildings  are  all  built  of  blue  Ohio  stone,  and  con-
structed with  hanging  steps.
The  system  for  heating  and  ventilating  is  on  the  most  approved
principle.  Under  the  central  court  of  the  Parliament  building  is  the
boiler  room,  in  which  are  six  boilers,  each  twenty  feet  long  and  five
feet  in  diameter,  furnished  with  a  steam-drum,  safety-valve,  &c.,  and

a  steam  engine  of  sufficient  horse  power  to  work  the  pumps  and
throw  250  gallons  of  water  per  minute  into  tanks  placed  in  Ihe
towers,  from  whence  the  water  is  supplied  to  all  parts  of  the  buildings.
The  heating  is  effected  by  steam  conveyed  in  pipes  from  these  boilers
to  the  Senate  Chamber,  the  Library,  and  the  rooms  adjoining,  by
means  of  a  duct  sufficiently  large  for  the  introduction  of  an  abundant
supply  of  fresh  air,  situated  immediately  under  a  vault  in  which
steam  pipes  are  placed  to  warm  the  air  on  its  entering  the  vault  from
the  duct,  through  a  perforated  floor,  and  before  it  passes  into  rooms
proposed  to  be  heated.  These  ducts  enter  on  all  sides  of  the  building,
and  range  in  size  according  to  the  position  in  which  they  are  placed.
Of  the  ducts,  there  are  3,600  lineal  feet,  generally  of  2  feet  4  inches
high,  with  sides  built  of  dressed  stone  and  formed  with  slight  descent
where  they  pass  out  of  the  building.  The  other  parts  of  the  building
are  heated  on  what  is  called  the  coil  system,  or  by  direct  radiation.
For  the  rooms  heated  by  this  system  there  is  an  area  of  4,308  feet  of
hot  air  flues,  24  by  19  inches  sectional  area,  formed  in  the  wall
adjoining  the  committee  rooms  and  other  parts  of  the  building  heated,
exclusive  of  ninety  feet  of  others  of  greater  dimensions  for  the  larger
steam  pipes.
In  the  internal  arrangement  nothing  appears  to  have  been  spared
to  make  the  buildings  as  perfect  as  possible.  The  wants  of  the  govern-
ment and  its  officials  have  been  most  carefully  studied  by  the  archi-
tects, and  when  all  is  completed,  the  beauty  of  the  situation,  combined
with  the  elegance  of  the  buildings,  will  enable  the  capitol  of  Canada
to  compare  with  any  in  the  world.
Messieurs  Fuller  and  Jones  were  the  Architects,  and  Mr.  Thomas
McGreevey,  the  Contractor  for  the  Parliament  Building.
Messieurs  Stent  and  Laver,  the  Architects,  and  Messieurs  Jones,
Haycock  &  Co.,  were  the  contractors  for  the  Departmental  Buildings.
Mr.  Charles  Garth  is  the  person  who  successfully  carried  out  the
system  for  heating  and  ventilation.

That  poi  lion  of  tlie  Country  which  is  drained  by  the  River  Ot-
tawa, and  its  tributaries,  is  very  little  known  by  the  majority  of  the
Canadian  people,  except  those  who  are  immediately  connected  with
the  lumber  business.  The  great  valley  of  the  Ottawa  lies  in  the  very
center  of  Canada  ;  the  river  itself  dividing  the  Provinces  of  Ontario
and  Quebec,  and  including  nearly  one-fourth  of  its  whole  territorial
extent.  This  valley  contains  an  area  of  about  80,000  square  miles,
and  furnishes  one  of  the  most  valuable  portions  of  our  Exports.
The  River  Ottawa,  is  suijposed  to  take  its  source  in  about  49°  of
North  Latitude,  and  76°  of  West  Longitude.  The  river  winds  its
course  through  the  forest  solitudes,  known  only  to  huiiters  and
the  scattered  agents  of  the  Hudson  Company,  which  lie  on  the
slope  of  the  highlands  that  separate  its  waters  from  those  of  Hudson's
Bay.  On  its  course  it  receives  many  tributaries,  and  expands  into
large  lakes.  At  about  300  miles  from  its  supposed  source,  and  440
from  its  mouth  at  Bout  de  ITsle,  below  Montreal,  the  Ottawa  takes
the  Indian  name  of  Lake  Temiscaming,  which  turns  at  right  angles
nearly  to  its  former  course  and  extends  for  67  miles  unbroken  by  fall
or  rapid.  At  the  head  of  this  lake  the  Ottawa  receives  its  tributary
called  La  Blanche  ;  this  streams  runs  north,  for  about  90  miles.
Near  the  outlet  of  the  Blanche,  to  the  west,  is  the  Keelacummavv,  a
stream  of  about  50  miles  in  length.
The  next  tributary,  on  the  Ontario  side  is  the  Montreal  River, —
its  mouth  being  34  miles  below  that  of  the  Blanche  ;  its  course  is
120  miles  north-west,  and  communicates  with  Lake  Temangamingue  ;
this  Lake  communicates  with  Lake  Nipissing  by  Sturgeon  River.
Between  Lake  Nipissing,  the  River  Montreal  and  the  River  Ottawa,
the  whole  country  is  intersected  by  lakes  of  various  sizes,  all  com-
municating together.

OTTAWA  niVER.
The  Keepawa-sippi  tributary,  6  miles  lower  down,  on  the  oppo-
site side,  is  the  mysterious  river  of  Canada.  It  proceeds  from  a  lake
known  as  Keepawa.  It  is  said  that  at  a  short  distance  from  its  mouth,
there  is  a  series  of  Cascades,  120  feet  in  height,  but  at  a  distance  of  a
half  mile  from  its  mouth  nothing  is  seen  of  a  cataract,  nor  can  we
hear  the  sound  of  such  a  body  of  water  falling.  This  river  and  the
lake  from  which  it  proceeds,  are  connected  with  a  chain  of  smaller
lakes,  from  one  of  which  proceeds  the  River  du  Moine,  which  empties
itself  into  the  Ottawa,  some  100  miles  lower  down.
The  Long  Sault  Rapid,  at  the  outlet  of  Lake  Temiscaming,  is  G
miles  in  length,  and  succeeded  by  another  expansion  of  the  Ottawa
called  the  Seven  League  Lake,  into  which  the  Antony  empties  itself,
on  the  south  side  ;  and  is  succeeded  by  the  Rapid  Les  Montagnes,
and  that  at  a  short  distance  by  another  dangerous  rapid  called  Les
Erables  ;  at  the  foot  of  this  rapid  on  tho  north  side,  the  River  Natta-
wissi  discharges  itself  with  a  fall  of  50  feet,  and  a  volume  of  water
equal  to  that  of  the  Montmorency  Fall,  near  Quebec.
The  cave  or  cellar  is  the  next  Rapid  ;  then  comes  the  Malawan,
just  above  the  mouth  of  the  River  of  the  same  name.  This  river  runs,
in  a  westerly  direction,  and  is  separated  from  Lake  Nipissing  by  a
short  portage  only  ;  this  is  the  route  taken  by  the  officers  and  voya-
geurs  of  the  Hudson's  Bay  Company  in  going  to  the  far  west,  and  is
the  shortest  and  most  direct  way  from  the  Province  of  Quebec  and
the  Eastern  States  to  Lake  Superior  and  the  Pacific  Ocean.  This  river.
Lake  Nipissing,  and  French  River  directly  connect  the  Ottawa  with
Lake  Huron,  and  in  this  direction,  eventually,  will  pass,  by  Railroad
or  Canal,  the  whole  traffic  between  the  seaboard  of  the  North-western
States  and  the  Great  Lakes,  and  finally  to  the  Pacific.
The  Levielle  is  followed  by  the  Trou,  at  the  head  of  which,  on
the  North,  is  the  mouth  of  the  Magna-sippi,  a  small  stream,  and  the
Rapid  Deux  Rivieres,  which  has  three  distinct  falls.  This  rapid  is
succeeded  by  the  great  falls  known  as  the  Rocher  Capitainc  ;  in
which  also  there  is  three  falls  ;  the  central  fall  in  its  wild  a-.id
picturesque  grandeur,  its  great  extent,  the  rugged  masses  of  rock  by
which  tlie  water  is  broken,  and  the  great  velocity  of  its  dark  and
deep  current,  presents  one  of  the  most  magnificent  views  on  the  river.
On  the  north  side,  below  the  Rocher  Capitaine,  is  the  moulh  of
Bear  River,  and  three  miles  below  that,  on  the  same  side,  the  mouth
of  the  Du  Moine  ;  on  the  south  side  is  the  mouth  of  Grant  Greek,
and  then  we  have  the  Rapid  Deux  Joachim.  This  is  a  tremendous
rapid,  through  which  no  cribs  can  pass  without  being  smashed  to
pieces  ;  in  order  to  avoid  this  rapid,  the  government  have  constructed
slides  and  dams  ;it  a  great  expense.

At  this  point,  there  is  a  good  hotel,  and  it  may  be  called  the
verge  of  civilisation,  for  at  this  place  is  the  last  post  office.  Between
Pembroke  and  the  Deux  Joachim  a  steamer  plies  three  times  a  week.
No  one  who  is  any  way  particular  about  his  own  comfort  should
attempt  to  go  further ;  the  progress  can  be  accomplished  by  canoe,  and
the  numerous  rapids,  compelling  frequent  portages,  make  further
travel  upward  a  work  of  some  labour,  but  for  those  who  are  fond  of
adventures  and  excitement,  nothing  could  be  more  desirable.  From
the  point  on  which  is  the  Hotel,  the  view  is  one  of  the  finest  in  the
Country  ;  the  river  runs  in  a  straight  direction  for  43  mileS,  south-
east, bounded  on  the  north  side  by  a  high  mountain  chain,  partially
wooded,  and  on  the  south  by  a  richly  wooded  and  gradually  ascending
range  of  hills,  resembling  the  "  palisades  "  on  the  Hudson  River.
From  the  entrance  of  the  Ottawa  into  Lake  Temiscaming,  to  the
end  of  the  expansion,  is  07  miles  ;  the  Long  Sault  Rapid  6  miles  ;
Seven  League  Lake  is  17  miles,  thence  to  the  Mattawan  13  miles,  and
the  succession  of  navigable  reaches  and  Rapids  to  the  Deux  Joachim
50  miles  ;  the  total  distance  from  the  foot  of  Lake  Temiscaming  to
the  City  of  Ottawa  being  about  2G3  miles  by  the  course  of  the  river.
From  the  foot  of  the  Deux  Joachim  Rapids  to  the  foot  of  Upper
Allumette  Lake  ;  (another  expansion  of  the  Ottawa  River,)  two  miles
below  the  village  of  Pembroke,  is  an  uninterrupted  reach  of  deep
and  navigable  water.  The  upper  part  of  it  called  Deek  River  is
bounded  by  mountains  on  the  north  side,  a  thousand  feet  high,  while
the  Allumette  Lake  is  studied  with  innumerable  beautifully  wooded
Islands,  the  whole  scene  far  surpassing  in  grandeur  the  celebrated
Thousand  Islands  on  the  River  St.  Lawrence.
Passing  the  short  Rapid  of  the  Allumette,  and  turning  north-
ward round  the  lower  end  of  the  Allumette  Island,  fourteen  miles
long,  and  eight  wide,  we  enter  Lake  Coulonge,  another  expansion  of
the  Ottawa,  at  the  end  of  which  the  channel  is  again  divided  by  the
Calumet  Island,  in  all  a  reach  of  navigable  water  for  50  miles.  The
mountains  v  hich  border  Lake  Coulonge  on  the  north  rise  to  about
1,500  feet,  and  present  a  beautiful  and  varied  scene.
On  the  Upper  Allumette  Lake,  on  the  Ontario  side,  is  the
mouth  of  the  Petawawee,  one  of  the  largest  and  most  important  tribu-
taries of  the  Ottawa,  being  amply  provided  with  the  finest  timber,
is  140  miles  in  length,  and  drains  an  area  of  2,200  square  miles ;  9
miles  below  this,  on  the  same  side,  is  the  mouth  of  a  small  stream
called  Indian  River.  Upon  it  is  situated  the  thriving  and  busy  little
town  of  Pembroke,  the  capital  of  the  Upper  Ottawa.
At  the  head  of  Lake  Coulonge  on  the  north  side,  is  the  mouth  of
the  Black  River,  130  miles  in  length,  and  draining  an  area  of  1,120
%

OTTAWA   RIVER.
square  miles  ;  and  on  the  same  side,  9  miles  lower  down,  is  the
mouth  of  the  Coulonge,  160  miles  long,  draining  an  area  of  1 ,800  square
miles.    The  finest  pine  timber  is  produced  on  both  these  rivers.
From  the  head  of  the  Calumet  Falls  to  the  Village  of  Portage  du
Fort,  the  Rapids  are  impassable,  and  the  scenery  the  grandest  imagi-
nable. The  timber  is  taken  past  these  Rapids  by  means  of  slides,
constructed  at  great  expense  by  Government.  The  Rapids  on  the
south  side  of  the  Calumet  Islands  are  called  the  Rocher  Frmdu  ;  the
principal  rapids  on  the  north  side  are  the  Grand  Calumet,  the
Derangfes  and  the  Sables.
Here  we  have  come  to  a  pretty  and  flourishing  village  called
Portage  du  Fort ;  there  is  a  macadamised  road  to  the  head  of  the
Calumet  Rapids,  from  which  point  a  steamer  runs  to  Pembroke,  a
distance  of  thirty  miles.  Opposite  Portage  du  Fort  there  is  an  excel-
lent waggon  road,  which  brings  to  a  small  steamer  plying  on  Muskrat
Lake,  which  takes  the  traveller  within  a  short  distance  of  Pembroke.
On  leaving  Portage  du  Fort  in  the  steamer,  we  soon  arrive  at
the  Rapides  Les  Ghenau.x  .  tl  (  iver  is  here  divided  by  small  islands,
covered  with  wood,  between  which  the  water  rushes  with  great  swift-
ness, but  except  in  the  hi;,  h  water  of  Mio  spring,  the  steamer  breasts  the
current  gallantly  ;  the  ChenaiLv  Rapids  are  at  the  head  of  Lake  Les
Chats,  a  beautiful  expansion  of  the  river.  Into  Lake  Les  Chats  are
discharged,  on  the  Ontario  side,  the  River  Bonne  Chere,  about  110
miles  in  lengths  ;  draining  an  area  of  980  square  miles  ;  the  Mada-
waska,  one  of  the  largest  of  the  tributaries,  210  miles  in  length,
draining  an  area  of  4,100  square  miles  ;  on  its  mouth  is  situated  the
large  and  important  village  of  Arnprior  which  has  been  created
within  a  few  years  past  by  the  liberal  enterprise  of  Daniel  McLachlan,
Esquire;  and  the  Mississippi,  101  miles  long,  draining  an  area  of
■'  150  miles.  These  are  three  of  the  largest  timber  producing  tribu-
aries  of  the  Upper  Ottawa.
Lake  Les  Chats  is  about  16  miles  long,  and  is  from  1  to  4  miles
broad.  There  is  a  number  of  small  islands  scattered  over  its  placid
surface,  and  the  lake  being  perfectly  straight,  these  can  be  seen
all  at  once.
The  navigation  of  the  River  Ottawa  is  again  totally  arrested  at
the  foot  of  Lake  Les  Chats,  by  a  series  of  remarkable  rapids,  from
which  the  Lake  derives  its  name.  The  whole  volume  of  water  in
this  great  river,  here  not  far  from  a  mile  w'ide,  is  barred  in  a  dia-
gonal direction  by  a  huge  ledge  of  limestone  rock,  over  which  the
water  pours  in  white  foam,  and  with  stunning  noise,  from  a  height
of  50  feet  in  33  distinct  falls  in  high  water,  and  16  when  the  water  is
low  during  summer.    These  falls  are  separated  by  Islands.    Many  of
OTTAWA   RIVER.

these  cataracts  are  highly  picturesque  ;  over  every  one  of  tliem
there  pours  a  volume  of  water,  at  least  equal  to  that  contained  in  the
Teign,  Dart,  or  Tavy,  in  Devonshire,  five  miles  from  their  mouths.
If  in  England,  each  separate  cascade  would  attract  as  many  visitors
as  the  celebrated  falls  of  Lodore,  which  is  a  mere  rain-water  spout
compared  with  Les  Ghats.  These  falls  can  all  be  seen  at  once,  as  the
steamer  passes  slowly  along  them,  from  Fitzroy  Harbour,  Ontario
side,  to  the  wharf  at  the  other  extremity  of  the  falls  on  the  Quebec
side.  The  rocks  between  the  Cascades  are  all  covered  with  trees,  manv
of  them  of  large  size,  which  gives  them  the  appearance  of  Islands.
On  landing  from  the  steamer  at  the  foot  of  Lake  Chats,  we  find
ourselves  on  a  convenient  wharf,  and  presently  we  are  invited  to
take  a  seat  in  an  open  carriage,  drawn  by  two  horses,  and  soon  find
ourselves  travelling  at  a  fast  trot  along  a  Railway  track.  This  Railway
is  built  across  the  barrier  of  rock  on  jjiles  of  squared  trees  laid
across  each  other  in  alternate  layers ;  in  many  places,  it  has  been
necessary  to  raise  these  piles  20  feet  from  the  ground,  so  as  to  obtain
a  level ;  there  is  no  railing  or  fence,  but  during  the  many  years  it
has  been  in  operation,  no  accident  has  ever  occured  on  it.  On
arriving  at  the  other  end  of  the  railroad,  which  is  three  miles  long,
we  have  a  long  flight  of  stairs  to  descend  to  the  wharf  below  ;  these
are  built  in  a  warehouse  belonging  to  the  steamboat  company,  and
are  necessary  on  account  of  the  difference  between  the  level  of  the
railroad,  and  that  of  the  river  below.
Alongside  of  the  wharf  below  lies  the  steamer  on  which  we
embark  and  steam  at  a  rapid  pace  down  the  beautiful  Lake  Duchene
to  Aylmer,  a  nice  village  on  the  Quebec  side,  only  8  miles  from  the
City  of  Ottawa.  The  stepmer  stays  at  Aylmer  on  account  of  several
rapids  below,  and  passtngers  are  brought  into  Ottawa  by  stages.
On  the  south  side,  below  the  Chats  Rapids,  is  the  mouth  of  the
Carp,  a  small  stream,  at  the  village  of  Fitzroy  Harbour,  and  almost
opposite  on  the  north  side  is  the  mouth  of  the  Quio,  also  a  small
stream,  but  very  important  as  it  produces  magnificent  white  pine.
The  Chaudiere  Lake  is  about  30  miles  long,  winding  southward
towards  its  upper  end,  and  is  from  I  to  2  miles  in  breadth.  Some  of
the  lands,  for  10  or  12  miles,  on  the  Ontario  side,  are  very  good
and  well  cultivated.  Beyond  this,  and  towards  the  Chats,  the  south
coast  is  low  and  the  soil  not  so  good,  being  light  and  sandy,  but  is
very  superior  a  little  further  back  ;  on  the  Quebec  shore  the  soil
is  also  excellent,  and  on  the  road  from  Ottawa  to  Aylmer  and  above  it.
For  a  great  part  of  the  way  the  Eardley  Mountains  rise  like  a  gigantic
wall  on  the  north  side  at  four  miles  back  from  the  lake.
At  a  short  distance  below  Aylmer  the  Ottawa  begins  to  close  in

and  the  stream  becomes  rapid  and  turbulent.  The  navigation  is  here
interrupted  again,  for  more-  than  5  miles,  in  which  we  find  three
short  but  distinct  rapids,  the  Du  Chene,  the  Remnoks,  and  the  little
Chaudiere  ;  these  rapids  have  together  a  descent  of  about  60  feet
over  a  bed  of  dark  limestone,  until  at  length  the  mighty  stream  pours
in  thunder  over  the  rocks  which  arrest  its  progress  at  the  City  of
Ottawa,  forming  the  well  known  Chaudifere  Falls.
At  the  easterly  boundary  of  the  City,  the  Rideau  pours  over  a
high  rocky  bank  into  the  Ottawa,  on  the  Ontario  side  ;  this  river
has  a  westerly  course  for  IIG  miles,  and  drains  an  area  of  1,350
square  miles.
About  a  mile  lower  down,  on  the  Quebec  side,  is  the  mouth
of  the  Gatineau,  the  largest  of  all  the  known  tributaries,  itself  receiv-
ing tributaries,  which  would  be  called  great  rivers  in  any  other  country
but  this ;  one  of  them,  the  Jean  de  Terre,  is  known  to  have  a  course  of
170  miles.  The  Gatineau  is  tolerably  well  known  for  about  200  miles
of  its  course,  but  the  remainder,  supposed  to  be  240  miles  more,  pene-
trates into  the  unknown  northern  forests.  At  217  miles  from  its
mouth,  the  furthest  point  surveyed,  the  Gatineau  is  still  a  noble
stream,  at  least  1,000  feet  wide,  diminished  in  depth,  but  little  in
width.  The  Gatineau  is  supposed  to  drain  an  area  of  12,000  square
miles,  and  from  the  great  volume  of  its  waters,  no  doubt  discharges
those  proceeding  from  some  large  inland  lakes.
A  small  river,  La  Blanche,  is  discharged  at  a  few  miles  below
the  Gatineau,  and  again  a  few  miles  below  that  is  the  mouth  of  the
River  aux  Lievres,  having  a  course  of  about  2G0  miles,  and  connected
with  a  chain  of  small  lakes,  which  are  themselves  connected  with
the  River  St.  Maurice,  another  large  river  which  unites  with  the  St
Lawrence  at  the  City  of  Three  Rivers,  half  way  between  Mont-
real and  Quebec.
The  next  tributary  is  the  North  Nation,  and  almost  opposite,  on
the  Ontario  side,  the  South  Nation,  each  stream  having  a  course
of  about  100  miles.
Below  the  North  Nation  is  the  mouth  of  the  River  Rouge,  with
a  course  of  90  miles,  and  below  that  the  River  du  Nord,  with  a
course  of  160  miles.  No  tributaries  now  occur  until  at  a  quite  short
distance  from  the  mouth  of  the  northern  branch  of  the  Ottawa,  below
Montreal,  where  it  receives  the  River  L'Assomption.
From  the  City  of  Ottawa,  the  river  is  navigable  to  Grenville,  63
miles  below,  where  the  navigation  is  interrupted  by  a  rapid  12  miles
long.  This  rapid  is  avoided  by  a  canal  constructed  by  the  Imperial
Government,  but  now  in  the  hands  of  the  Government  of  Canada,
which  is  getting  it  enlarged  to  permit  a  larger  class  of  vessels  to  pass
OTTAWA   RIVER.
n
through.  At  Grenville  there  is  a  Railway  which  takes  pnssengers
down  to  Carillon.  On  leaving  the  cars  at  Carillon  the  traveller  finds
himself  steaming  down  the  Ottawa,  and  there  is  no  further  obstruc-
tion to  the  navigation,  except  the  short  rapid  at  St.  Anne's,  which  is
avoided  by  one  lock,  on  the  north  side  ;  the  steamer  then  proceeds
till  the  point  is  reached,  at  which  the  confluence  of  one  of  the  outlets
of  the  Ottawa  with  the  St.  Lawrence  takes  place,  forming  Lako  St.
Louis.  The  passengers  disembark  at  Lachine,  and  Montreal  is  reached
by  rail.
The  main  stream  of  the  Ottawa  is  divided  into  three,  by  the
intervention  of  Isle  Jesus  and  the  Island  of  Montreal  ;  the  north
branch  is  the  channel  by  which  the  lumber  from  the  Ottawa  finds  its
way  to  Quebec.  The  waters  of  the  Ottawa  are  not  finally  merged
into  those  of  the  St.  Lawrence,  until  the  junction  of  the  two  northern
branches,  at  Bout  de  I'lsle,  130  miles  from  the  city  of  Ottawa.
It  is  evident  that  the  most  prominent  characteristic  of  the  OttatVa
is  its  great  volume  ;  and  in  the  spring,  when  the  waters  of  the  river
are  at  their  highest,  from  the  rains  and  the  melting  of  the  northern
snow,  an  approximate  calculation  shows  that  the  volume  of  water
passing  over  the  Ghaudiere  Falls,  is  equal  to  that  of  the  Niagara
Falls.
Many  small  streams  and  creeks  which  empty  themselves  into  the
Ottawa  have  not  been  mentioned,  but  if  fourteen  only  of  the  best
known  tributaries  are  taken,  it  will  be  seen  that  they  contain  more  than
3,000  miles  of  course,  and  drain  an  immense  area  of  Country.  Many
of  these  tributaries  are  longer  than  many  of  the  longest  and  largest  of
the  rivers  in  Great  Britain,  and  any  one  of  them  flowing  in  a  country
of  the  old  world,  would,  long  ere  this,  have  become  famous  in  song.
in  story,  and  in  art.
In  a  general  view  the  Valley  of  the  Ottawa,  is  a  region  eight
times  the  extent  of  Vermont,  ten  times  that  of  Massachussetts  ;  it  is
drained  by  a  noble  river  equal  to  the  Rhine  in  its  length  of  course,
and  to  the  Danube  in  magnitude  ;  the  greater  part  of  this  noble
valley  is  covered  with  a  luxuriant  growth  of  forest  trees,  particularly
of  red  and  white  pine  ;  the  harder  wood  also  exists  in  abundance  ;
the  soil  is  in  general  of  excellent  quality,  and  all  the  townships
bordering  on  the  river,  and  back  on  the  course  of  several  of  the  tri-
butaries, are  mostly  settled.
Of  the  glorious  forest  scenery,  it  is  hardly  necessary  to  speak,  for
every  one  has  heard  of  it ;  there  may  be  more  beauty  of  form  in  the
graceful  and  feathery  palm,  in  the  fragrant  magnolia,  the  boast  of
tropic  climes,  but  whether  in  the  stern  and  gloomy  grandeur  of  the
pine  forests,  or  in  the  exquisite  beauty  of  colouring  that  distinguishes

the  hard  wood  groves  when  aiitumn.il  frosts  have  lighted  up  their
leaves  with  all  the  splendours  of  crimson  and  gold,  or  a  combination
of  them  all,  when  the  dark  green  foliage  of  the  pines  forms  a  back-
ground to  the  scarlet  maples  ;  then,  there  is  nothing  in  nature  more
grand  than  a  Canadian  forest  in  the  autumn  tide.
The  tourists  from  the  States  wishing  to  visit  the  Ottawa  Valley
with  its  beauties,  the  usual  pleasure  route  is  via  Saratoga,  Niagara,
down  to  Proscott,  opposite  Ogdensburg,  N.  Y.,  passing  through  the
Thousand  Islands.  Prescott  is  the  Terminus  of  the  St.  Lawrence  and
OtU'iwa  Railway.  This  Railroad  makes  two  trips  every  day,  to  Ottawa
and  back,  thus  affording  to  travellers  an  expeditious  and  safe  route,
for  this  road  is  acknowledged  to  be  the  best  built  road  in  the  country  ;
and  like  every  other  Railway  and  Steamboat  Companies  in  the  Country,
the  employees  are  very  attentive  and  obliging.
After  visiting  the  principal  places  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of
tht  City,  the  tourist  leaves  early  in  the  morning,  and  after  one  hour's
drive  over  a  very  good  macadamized  road,  reaches  the  Village  of
Aylmer,  and  there  finds  the  steamer  ready  to  leave  for  the  head  of
Lake  Du  Ch6ne  ;  the  Railway  takes  him  to  the  foot  of  Lake  Chats,
another  steamer  lies  in  wailing  to  take  passengers  up  to  Portage  du
Fort,  (passing  on  the  way,  the  beautiful  Chenaux.)  Here,  if  he  does  not
wish  to  go  further,  he  can  put  up  at  the  Hotel  for  the  night,  and  have
ample  time  to  look  at  the  Rapids  of  the  Grand  Calumet ;  see  the
timber  passing  through  the  slides  ;  collect  some  specimens  of  mica,
combined  with  felspar,  quartz,  and  of  the  fine  white  or  pink  statuary
marble  to  be  found  iu  every  direction ;  a  long  night  rest ;  and  return
by  the  same  steamer  next  morning.  Should  the  tourist's  time  admit
of  it,  we  would  by  all  means  recommend  him  to  continue  his  excur-
sion upwards  by  the  Grand  Calumet  route.  From  Portage  du  Fort
there  is  an  excellent  macadamised  road,  seven  miles  in  length,
through  a  beautiful  country,  to  the  Grand  Calumet.  From  the  Calumet
the  steamer  runs  thirty  miles,  up  the  Calumet  and  Culbute  Channels
to  within  a  few  miles  of  Pembroke,  to  which  the  passengers  are
carried  by  a  short  stage  and  ferry.  This  route  which  passes  up  the
channels  on  the  north  side  of  the  Calumet  and  AUumette  Islands  and
through  Lake  Coulonge,  which  lies  between  them,  presents  a  series  of
rich,  beautiful  and  romantic  scenery,  surpassing  any  thing  on  the
course  of  the  Ottawa  below  it ;  and  only  itself  surpassed  in  beauty
and  grandeur,  by  the  sail  through  Upper  AUumette  Lake  and  Deep
River  from  Pembroke  to  the  Deux  Joachim.  Sometimes  the
Calumet  Steamer  passes  up  the  channel  south  of  AUumette  Island
and  Lower  AUumette  Lake  to  the  AUumette  Rapids  below  Pembroke.
In  returning  down  Paquet's  Rapids,  on  this  route  the  scenery  and  the
OTTAVVA   RIVER.
panoramic  effect  of  it  is  much  finer  than  any  thing  that  can  he  soon
on  the  rapids  of  the  St.  Lawrence.
Tiie  other  phm  is  to  stop  at  Gould's  wharf  on  tlie  other  side  of
the  river,  some  distance  before  reaching  Portage  du  Fort,  take  tiie
waggon  in  waiting  and  drive  over  the
Portage
to  Mnskrat  Lake,
where  is  a  small  steamer,  which,  with  another  short  waggon  portage,
will  bring  him  to  Pembroke;  there  he  will  sleep  ;  from  this  another
steamer  will  take  him  on  to  Les  Deux  Joachim,  where  in  a  most
hospitable  Hotel,  he  will  find  himself  perfectly  at  homo,  and  at  the
extremity  of  civilization.  If  he  be  indifferent  to  the  fatigue  of  paddling
or  portaging,  dangers  of  rapids,  and  have  a  liking  for  pork  and  biscuit —
he  can  go  on  to  see  the  wild  Rocher  Gapitaine,  the  Deux  Rivieres,
the  Cave,  and  the  Montagne,  see  the  beautiful  fall  of  the  Notawissi,
pass  the  mouth  of  the  Mysterious  Keepawa-sippi,  and  make  his  camp-
fire  at  the  head  of  Temiscaming.
Returning  down  the  River,  where  splendid  pike  fishing  is  to  be  had,
and  an  occasional  salmon  trout,  the  tourist  may,  if  ho  wish  to  go
west,  meet  the  train  either  at  Sand  point,  the  terminus  of  the  Brock-
ville  Railroad,  or  proceed  five  miles  further  to  Arnprior,  from  where
the  cars  start  daily  for  Brockville.  But  if  he  wish  to  go  East  he  must
return  to  Ottawa  ;  there  he  has  to  choose  between  the  river  Ottawa
and  the  St.  Lawrence.  If  he  came  to  Ottawa  by  the  St.  L.  and  0.
Railway  from  Prescott  or  Ogdensburg,  he  can  take  the  steamer  and
proceed  down  the  Ottawa  River  to  Grenville,  then  take  the  train  to
Carrillon  ; — arrived  at  Carillon,  a  steamer  will  take  him  to  Lachine.
Between  Carillon  and  Lachine  the  navigation  is  interrupted  by  the
rapids  Ste.  Anne,  in  reference  to  which  Tom  Moore  WTote  hisachnirod
Canadian  boat  song,
"  Row,  brothers,  row,  the  strenm  runs  fast,
"  The  rapids  are  near,  and  the  day  light  is  past,  iSrc."
On  its  downward  trip,  the  steamer  passes  through  the  rapids  ^lo.
Anne,  then  continues  down  the  Ottawa,  through  the  Lake  of  Two
Mountains,  to  Lachine  ;  thence  by  Railway  to  Montreal,  arriving  at
Montreal  the  same  evening.  The  tourist  will  find  this  route  vorv
rich  in  scenery.  But  should  he  wish  to  descend  the  rapids  of  the
St.  Lawrence  to  Montreal,  he  can  go  by  the  St.  Lawrence  and  Oltav  •
Railway  to  Prescott,  and  take  the  downward  boat  ; — this  route  will
take  him  through  the  Rapids  les  Galops,  Rapid  Plats,  Long  Sault,  Los
Cedres,  the  Cascades,  and  Sault  St.  Louis,  and  when  arrived  at  Mont-
real, the  tourist  will  admit  that  such  sensation  is  not  to  be  picked  up
everywhere.  But  if  he  does  not  wish  to  go  to  Montreal,  he  can  cross
over  to  Ogdensburg  from  Prescott,  and  proceed  by  Railway  to  Boston,
New  York,  or  any  other  place  in  the  United  States.

From  Montreal,  the  tourist  may  reach  Quebec  by  steamer  or  by
Railway.  Once  in  Quebec  the  sightseeker  will  convince  himself  that
old  Stadacona  is  not  below  the  fame  she  possesses  of  being  the
most  Grand  in  scenery  :  we  have  hoard  a  tourist  say,  that  the  view
from  Gap  Diamond  is,  alone,  worth  the  journey.  The  St.  Lawrence
watering  places,  deserve,  also,  the  attention  of  the  traveller.  Riviere
du  Loup,  Murray  Day,  Tadoussac  and  the  Saguenay,  are  places  where
he  will  find  good  society  during  the  Summer  months.
Returning  to  Quebec,  he  can  take  the  route  to  the  White  Moun-
tains, and  then  go  southward,  either  by  Portland  or  by  the  Railways.
Thus  the  traveller  may  make  a  large  circuit,  without  going  twice

PHACTICK   OF   PAIILIAMENT.
EXTEACT  OF  THE  ROUTINE  AND  rifACTICE  OF  PARIJAMENT.
(By  an  old  Member.)
Avoidance  of  a  Di-cfsion*. — When  a  motion  has  been  made,  upon  whicli  the
House  is  unwiUing  to  come  to  a  vote,  there  aro  certain  formal  modes  of  avoiding
a  decisioii,  amongst  which  are —
"Passing  to  the  other  orders  of  the  day."
"Moving  the  previous  (|uestion."
Tlie  former  means  that  the  House  should — casting  aside  and  taking  no  fur-
ther notice  of  the  matter  then  before  it — proceed  to  the  other  business  ajipointed
ibr  that  day ;  the  latter  means,  that  a  vote  be  previously  taken  as  to  the  expe-
diency of  coming  to  any  deci.sion  on  the  question  raised.  If  "  the  previous  qiics-
Hon  "  of  expediency  be  negatived,  the  motion  to  which  it  referred  is  not  killed —
it  is  only  delayed  for  a  time  :  but  a  direct  negative  to  the  motion  itself,  would
proscribe  it  for  the  remainder  of  the  Session,  as  •veil  as  deny  the  principle
invulved.  With  rosj.ect  to  a  Bill, — l)y  moving  that  it  "  be  read  this  day  six  months,''^
or  "  this  dai/  three  innntha,''  it  is  thrown  over  without  coming  to  any  express
declaration  against  the  i^rinciple  of  the  measure.
Bills  (Pidilie.) — A  Bill  is  the  draft  or  skeleton  of  a  Statute.    No  Bill  can  be
brought  in  unless  a  motiou  for  leave  be  iirtviously  agreed  to,  or  U23on  motion  to
appoint  a  Committee   to   prepare  and  Itring   it  in ;    it  is  then  brought  in  and
read  a  first  time,  general!}'  without  amendment  or  debate;    a  day  is   then
appointed  for  the  second  I'cading,  before  which  day  it  is  printed,  and   a  cojiy
I'urni.'rhed   to   every  member.     After   the   second   reading,    it  is   referred  to  a
Cc'imiittc^e  of  the   whole    House,  when   its  detai?^  aro   considered,  as  its  prin-
ciples were,  ujion   its  jjrovious  readings.     The   principles  of  a  Bill   may  Ije
disi'ussed  at  any  of  its  stages,  but  no  member  is  considered  to  have  declared
decisively  in  its  favor,  unless  he  supports  it  by  his  vote  at  the  second  reading.
In  Committee  of  the  whole  House,  the  preamble  and  title  are  the  last  con-
sidered.    The  Bill  is  debated  or  considered  clause  by  clause.     The  blanks  lei't
for  iiumr.t,  dates,  nature  and  amount  of  penalty,  are  tilled  up  while  in  Committee,
and  it  i'r<'(juently  happens  that  the  Bill  is  entirely  re-modelled.     FornuM'ly  the
I    blanks  were  left,  but  now  it  is  the  practice  to  till  up  those  blanks  with  the  jiro-
j    posed  words  printed   in  italics.     It  avoids  surprise,  and  frequently  discussion ;
I    for  I)eing  before  the  mem1)ers,  they  are  agreed  to  without  any  (questions  Ijeing
j    put,  unless  any  member  shoid<l  propose  to  alter  them.     The  Chairman  of  the
I   Committee  then  makes  a  re])ort  to  the  House  of  the  changes  made  to  the  Bill,
j    which  he  does  by  i)resenting  a  copy  of  it  to  the  Sjieakc^r  in  its  altered  form.
j   The  I'eport  is  forthwith  I'cceivcd,  or  ordered  to  be  received  on  a  certain  day,  and
)    the  Bill  is  still  open  for  amendment  and  debate  before  the  third  reading;  but
!    when  a  Bill  is  reported  without  ..iUendment,  it  is  forthwith  ordered  to  be  read  a
I    third  time  at  such  time  as  may  be  appointed  by  the  Iiouse.     After  a  Bill  has
j    been  read  a  third  t  ipn-,  amendments  may  still  be  added ;  if  a  new  clause  be
i   added,  it  is  called  a  ''Kider.'     The  last  question  but  one  is,  that  "  the  Bill  do

pass."'     After  tliis,  nothing  remains  except  to  determine  its   title.     During  tlie
progress  of  a  Bill,  tho  House  may  divide  on  the  following  questions  :-r-
]st.  On  the  Second  Heading.
Und.  That  it  be  committed.
3rd.  That  the  Report  of  the  Committee  be  received.
4th.  That  the  Bill  be  recommitted.
5th.  That  it  be  read  a  Third  Time.
Oth.  That  it  do  pass,
7th.  The  title  of  the  Bill.
These  are  exclusive  of  any  divisions  in  Committee,  or  on  any  amendments,
or  clauses  pro})Osed  to  be  added  to  or  taken  from  the  measure,  in  or  out  of  the
Committee.  Alterations  are  not  usually  proj»osed  to  a  Bill  until  ni'Un-  its  prin-
ciple has  been  disposed  of,  on  the  second  reading.  Immediately  after  tiie  pass-
ing of  the  Bill,  it  is  taken  to  the  Upper  House,  and  the  concurrence  of  the
Senate  is  asked  thereto.  If  a  Bill  be  rejected,  no  further  proceedings  ensue.
When  the  Senate  agree  with  the  Commons  on  the  principle  of  a  measure,  but
differ  in  matters  of  detail,  a  conference  sometimes  follows.  l)etween  Meml)ers
deputed  from  each  House,  who  generally  succeed  in  a<ljusting  the  difference  ;
but  if  I  -jth  Houses  are  inflexible,  the  Bill  is  dropjied.
No  Bill  relating  to  trade,  or  the  alteration  of  the  Laws  concerning  trade,
can  be  brought  into  the  House,  until  the  proposition  shall  have  been  first  con-
sidered in  committee  of  the  whole  House,  and  agreed  to  by  tlie  House.  The
same  proceetling  is  required  with  reference  to  any  new  tax  to  be  imjiosed  upon
the  peoi^le  of  any  locality.
TiiF  BuDOF.T. — The  Minister  of  Finance  makes  one  general  statement  every
year  to  the  Commons,  which  is  intended  to  pi'escnt  a  comprehensive  view  of  the
financial  condition  of  the  country.  It  is  not  to  bo  supposed  that  this  is  tlie  only
speech  which  the  Minister  of  Finance  is  called  upon  to  make:  but  this  is  the
i^pcevli,  shewing  the  past  and  giving  his  views  ui)on  the  future,  and  in  fact,  it  is  a
deman<l  made  upon  the  people's  liejiresentatives,  to  confiiin  liis  coniluct  in
managing  the  Financial  Dei^artment  of  the  country.  He  courts  encjuiry.  and
expects  to  hesjr  from  the  leader  of  the  Oiiposition.  his  views  upon  the  j)rospects
of  the  material  interests  of  the  country,  as  laid  befoi-e  Parliament.  Any  changes
which  a  (lovernment  propose  to  make  in  ihe  financial  po-itioii  of  the  country,
are  always  pointedly  allude<l  to  in  this  speech,  and  tlie  Opposition  is  thus  put  in
full  possession  of  <vhat  the  Government  intend  to  do.
Ci.KiiK  or  TiiK  IiousE  OF  CoMMo.vs. — The  Clerk  of  tlie  Connnons  is  certainly  one
of  great  official  trust  an<l  importance.  He  is  appointed  by  the  Crown,  and  has
the  right  of  appointing  his  own  deputy,  when  one  is  re(]uired.  In  England,  the
appointment  of  the  other  officers  of  the  House  is  vested  in  tiie  <  "liMk  :  lait  it  is
different  in  Canada.  Either  tho  Speaker  or  tlie  House,  at  tiie  instance  of  the
Committees,  make  the  appointments.  It  is  his  duty  to  make  miinites — not  of
the  arguments  held  in  the  House,  but  of  the  decisions  at  wliicli  it  arrives — in
other  words,  simply  to  recoi'd  its  votes,  resol-itions.  addresses,  orders,  reports,
divisions,  and  all  other  proceedings  in  whicn  it 'nay  he  engaged  ;  to  seiMJiat
they  are  correctly  printed,  and  distrilaited  to  tlie  nic'inbers;  to  read  aloud  all
such  docuni!  nts  as  the  House  may  order  to  be  rea<l:  to  perform  the  <luty  (with-
out taking  the  chair)  of  chairman  during  the  cnoice  of  speaker.  lie  lias  two
assistants,  who  aid  him  in  the  desi)atch  of  the  business,  so  that  no  delay  may  be
occasioned.
CoMMirT.ii.s. — In  common  with  Courts  of  Law  ami  Equity,  the  Houses  of  Par-
liament can  ])unish  all  cases  of  eon  tempt  of  their  aiahovity  ordiscjbedienceof  their
mandates.  Each  Hcuso  is  ai-med  with  power  to  repress  any  aggression  com-
mitted upon  their  rights,  or  any  interference  with  their  privileges;  which,  how-
ever, cease  when  Parliament  is  prorogued.  The<'ommons,  as  well  as  th(>  Senate,

has  the  right  to  delegate  to  a  Committee  the  power  of   sending  for  persons,
records  and  papers,  and  of  enforcing  the  attendance  of  ne  jessary  witnesses.
Committees. — Are,  Jirst,  those  of  the  whole  House,  which  may  be  to  consider
certain  Resolutions,  as  to  the  nature  of  which  considerable  latitude  prevails :
or  th?  House  resolves  itself  into  Committee  to  consider  the  details  of  a  Bill,  the
principle  of  which  may  be  discussed  at  any  or  all  of  its  other  stages  ;  or  there
may  be  a  Committee  for  financial  purposes,  as  those  of  "Supply,"  or  "Ways
and  Means,"  as  alluded  to  elsewhere.  Secondly. — There  are  Select  Committees
chosen  by  ballot  or  otherwise,  for  some  specific  purpose.  The  numbers  com-
posing such  Committees  vary  according  to  the  nature  of  the  case,  but  cannot
exceed  fifteen,  unless  by  permission  of  the  House.  Finally. — Election  Com-
mittees, chosen  in  accoi-dance  with  the  Act  of  Parliament  regulating  contro-
verted Elections.  These  Committees  discharge  the  duties  of  judicial  tribunals.
They  are  appointed  by  a  general  (y'ommittee,  on  Elections,  who,  after  having
selected  a  cert^iin  number  from  the  members  to  constitute  the  Chairmen's  panel,
divide  the  remainder  into  panels,  and  report  the  same  to  the  House,  marked  1,
2  and  3.  The  Clerk,  in  the  presence  of  the  House,  places  the  whole  three  in  a
hat,  and  draws  them  forth,  numbering  each  in  rotation.  A,  B,  C.  The  General
Committee  then  selects  four  members  for  the  Committee  for  the  first  contro-
verted Election  referred  to  them,  and  at  the  same  time  the  Chairmen's  panel
assembles  and  ballots  for  a  Chairman  for  the  particular  Committee  chosen.  Then
there  are  several  Standing  Committees.  When  the  whole  House  is  in  Com-
mittee, the  Speaker  vacates  the  Chair,  the  Mace  is  placed  under  the  table,  some
member  is  culled  to  preside,  who  occupies  the  seat  of  the  senior  Clerk.  When
Select  Committees  are  appointed,  no  member  who  has  declared  against  the  piin-
c'ple  or  substance  of  a  Bill,  Resolution,  or  matter  to  be  committed,  can  be
nominated  of  puch  Committee.
Conference. — ^There  is  a  species  of  negociation  between  the  two  Houses  of
Parliament,  conducted  by  managers  appointed  by  each,  for  the  purpose  of  pro-
ducing concurrence,  in  cases  where  mutual  consent  is  necessary ;  or  for  the
purpose  of  reconciling  differences  which  may  have  arisen  upon  any  matter
requiring  the  action  of  both  Houses.  If  the  conference  be  upon  the  subject  of
a  Bill  depending  between  the  two  Houses,  it  must  be  demanded  by  that  House,
which,  at  the  time  of  asking  the  Conference,  is  in  possession  of  the  Bill.  When
the  Commons  requests  a  Conference  with  the  Senate,  the  reasons  to  be  given  by
the  Commons  must  bo  prepared  and  agreed  to  by  the  House,  before  a  message
is  sent  to  the  Senate  asking  a  Conference.  These  are  furnished  to  the  Managers,
who  on. meeting  the  Managers  of  the  Upper  House,  hand  in  the  reasons  in
writing.  Should  this  proceeding  fail  in  its  object,  a  "  free  Conference  "  is  held,
which  gives  an  opportunity  for  the  Managers  individually,  and  unrestrained  by
any  set  form  of  argument,  to  urge  such  reasons  as  in  their  judgment  may  best
tend  to  influence  the  House  to  which  they  are  addressed.  A  free  Confepence  is
usually  held,  if  two  Conferences  have  been  held  '.yithout  accomplishing  the
desired  o'yect.  After  one  free  Conference  has  been  held  upon  anyone  subject,  no
other  but  a  fres  Conference  can  be  held  touching  the  same  topic.  While  the
Managers  of  a  Conference  are  absent  on  duty,  the  Speaker  vacates  the  chair.
Estate  of  Parliament. — Parliament  fully  assembled,  consists  of  the  Monarch,
or  his  Representative,  the  Upper  House,  and  the  Lower  House.  They  are  more
frequently  spoken  of  as  the  three  branches  of  the  Legislature.  Neitlier  House
deliberates  in  the  presence  of  the  Queen's  Representative,  nor  will  either  of
them  permit  any  allusion,  in  debate,  to  the  opinions  or  sentiments  entertained
by  him.  The  three  branches  taken  together,  exercise  none  but  legislative  func-
tions, and  they  must  all  consent,  or  no  law  can  be  passed.  But  they  have  sepa-
rate functions  as  well.  The  Monarch,  or  Representative,  holds  the  whole  exe-
cutive authority,  and  while  the  Lower  House  alone  can  originate  Money  or  Tax
Bills,  the  Upper  House  is  deprived  of  this  power,     Nor  does  the  Upper  House
\

41
possess  the  great  function  of  trying  impeachments,  which  is  held  by  the  Lords
in  Great  Britain,  from  the  simple  fact,  that  there  is  no  power  invested  with  the
right  to  impeach.
House  of  Commons.— The  P^ taker  takes  the  chair  at  3  P.  M.,  daily.  If  there
is  a  quorum,  the  business  ;,-i  proceeded  with;  if  not,  the  House  is  adjourned  till
the  next  day,  at  3  P.  M.  Early  meetings  take  place  at  the  close  of  the  Session,
in  order  to  expedite  business,  and  bring  matters  to  a  close.  The  House  does
not  usually  meet  on  Saturrlay,  nor  does  it  assemble  on  any  holiday.  No  one  can
be  admitted  to  hear  tbo  debates,  without  an  order  from  the  Sergeaut-at  v^rms,
which  is  generally  obtained  through  a  Member.  Twenty  Members  constitute  a
quorum.
Interruption  of  the  Sittings  of  Parliament. — The  proceedings  of  the  Legis-
lature may  be  interrupted  or  suspended  either  by  ajournment,  prorogation,  or
dissolution.
Adjournment,  as  the  teion  itself  implies,  is  a  postponement  of  the  sitting
or  proceedings  of  the  House,  from  one  time  to  another  specified  for  the  re  as-
semblage. When  the  sitting  of  both  Houses  are  interrupted  by  royal  authority,
it  is  called  prorogation.  Dissolution  puts  an  end  to  the  representative  character
of  the  individuals  who,  at  the  time,  compose  the  House  of  Commons,  an  I  Par-
liament cannot  therefore  assemble  until  after  a  new  election,  except  in  cases
hereinafter  mentioned.  The  power  of  adjournment  is  a  right  belonging  to  each
House,  and  there  are  no  restraints  to  this  power.
The  House  of  Commons  can  interrupt  or  postpone  any  debate,  defer  the
consideration  of  any  measure,  or  altogether  adjourn  its  sitting,  but  the  practice
is  always  to  adjourn  to  some  stated  time ;  and  I  think  there  c;in  be  no  doubt
that,  by  the  previous  permission  of  the  House  the  Speaker  can  leave  the  Chair
for  a  certain  number  of  hours  -,  but  this  does  not  amount  to  an  adjournment,
and  could  not  be  noted  as  such  by  the  Clerk.  But  it  must  be  rema-ked  that
the  adjournment  of  one  House  does  not  adjourn  the  other.  The  Crown  may,
pending  an  adjournment,  summon  by  proclamation,  either  House,  or  both,  and
may  direct  either,  or  both  Houses  to  adjourn  to  any  particular  day.  But  while
this  power  exists,  ,  nd  although  in  former  times  it  has  been  frequently  exercised
in  the  Imperial  Leg-slature,  it  has  grown  into  dissuetude  there  as  well  as  in  the
provinces,  enjoying  the  privileges  of  their  own  local  Legislatures.
An  individual  member  may  for  a  time  interrupt  the  progress  of  business  by
successive  motions  for  adjournment,  which  may  be  repeated  indcHnitely,  with
this  restriction :  no  second  motion  to  adjourn  can  be  made  until  after  some
intermediate  proceeding  shall  have  been  had.  The  motion  in  conmiittee  that
the  chairman  report  progress,  is  equivalent  to  a  motion  to  adjourn  the  d(4)atL\
Adjournment  does  not  close  the  Sei^^ion :  nor  does  prorogation  terminate
Parliament.  The  former  is  an  act  which  'her  House  can  perfo.m;  the  Litter
is  a  power  vested  in  the  Crown,  the  duration  of  which  ni  \y  be  s  ibse  luontly
shortened  or  extended,  as  the  Crown  pleases.  All  unfinished  business  terminates
and  dies  with  a  prorogation,  l)ut  tluring  an  adjournment  they  retuain  in  .slafti
quo,  to  be  revived  on  the  re-assembling  of  Parliament.  A  m  ui.b  -r  who  moves
the  adjournment  of  a  debate,  or  who  is  in  possession  of  the  tloor  at  the  time  of
the  adjournment,  is  said  to  be  in  possession  of  the  House,  with  the  right  to
re-open  the  debate  which  has  been  interrupted.  This  is  not  the  c.»se,  however,
when  Conmiittees  of  the  whole  House  adjourn.  Prorogation  never  ex' ends
beyond  foity  days,  but  it  may  be  repeated  from  time  to  time  l)y  ])roelamiilion,
and  continue  to  be  renewed  until  it  is  intended  that  Parliam-Mit  shall  met;t  for
the  despatch  of  business.  The  Crown  can  summon  Parliament  at  any  time  by
giving  fourteen  day's  notice.  Dissolution  is  the  simple  death  of  Parliament,
and  may  be  brought  about  in  two  ways,  either  by  the  pleasure  of  the  Crown,  or
by  lapse  of  time  for  which  it  was  called  into  existence.  There  was  a  time  wh  'n
the  existence  of  a  parliament  terminated  by  the  <lemise  of  the  Crown,  but  a
special  law  removed  this  provision  of  the  Constitution.     But  there  is  no  power
42
PRACTICE    OF  PARLIAMENT.
ii
in  the  Constitution  by  which  a  Parliament  in  this  Province  can  be  exterxied
beyond  live  years.  If  Parliament,  at  the  time  of  the  Sovereign's  death,  be
separated  by  adjournment  or  prorogation,  it  must  assemble  immediately,  or
within  a  reasonable  period.  If  no  parliament  be  then  in  existence,  the  members
of  the  last  must  again  meet,  and  may  serve  as  a  parliament  for  six  months,
unless  sooner  prorogued.
Law  Clerks. — It  is  necessary  to  mention  these  officers  in  particular,  because
the  Eules  of  the  Ho'ise  assign  to  them  and  the  translators  certain  duties  which
must  be  performed,  to  ensure  correct  Legislation.  It  is  It  id  down  as  the  duty
of  the  Law  Clerk  to  revise  all  public  Bills  after  their  first  reading,  and  to  certify
thereon  that  the  same  are  correct ;  and  in  every  subsequent  stage  of  such  Bills,
the  Law  Clerk  shall  be  responsible  for  the  correctness  of  said  Bills,  should  they
be  amended.  The  responsibility  is  increased  by  the  fact  of  all  Bills  having  to  be
printed  in  both  languages,  English  and  French,  before  they  can  be  disposed  of.
The  House  is  particulaily  fortunate  in  having  the  whole  of  this  stattj  Law  Clerks
and  translators,  most  efficient.
Ordeu. — By  this  woi-d  is  meant  an  obedience  to  certain  rules  and  regulations
intended  to  ftxcilitate  the  dispatch  of  business,  and  preserve  that  necessary
decorum  so  essential  in  all  deliberative  assemblies.  The  Rules  by  which  the
business  of  Parliament  is  conducted  are  of  two  kinds;  one  class  the  House
possesses  in  common  with  all  deliberative  assemblies — another  is  peculiar  to  its
own  existence  and  powers.  P'or  the  proper  application  of  all  these  rules,  the
Speaker's  or  Chairman's  decision  is  had,  and  to  this  decision  due  deference  is  at
all  times  pnid.  The  Speaker,  while  in  the  Chair,  takes  no  part  in  the  debate,  it
being  his  duty  to  regulate  the  manner  in  which  business  shall  be  transacted  ;
to  coiiline  those  members  who  address  the  House  to  the  subject  under  consi-
deration ;  to  give  his  opinion  upon  all  things  which  relate  to  order ;  to  put  the
matter  in  dispute  into  the  form  of  a  question  upon  which  the  votes  of  members
are  taken,  and  to  declare  the  majority  as  soon  as  it  is  communicated  to  him  by
the  Clerk.  It  is  also  his  duty  to  declare  the  business  of  the  House  closed,  and
to  see  that  the  att'airs  of  the  House  are  correctly  and  properly  recorded.  After
routine,  he  calls  upon  the  member  whose  motion  stands  first  on  the  paper  of
notices,  or  wlio  is  otherwise  entitled  to  precedence.  All  motions  must  be  sec(jnded,
or  they  fall  to  the  ground ;  being  seconded,  the  motion  is  handed  in  writing  to
the  Speaker,  wlio  has  to  i-ead  it  before  debate  can  be  had  upon  it — having  been
read,  objections  may  be  urged.  There  are  several  ways  by  which  a  motion  may
be  opposed  ;  it  may  be  met  by  a  direct  negative,  or  by  an  amendment,  or  by  a
motion  to  postpone,  or  by  proceeding  to  the  next  order  of  the  day,  or  by  moving
tlie  previous  question,  or  by  the  simple  motion  of  adjournment.  A  motion  once
read  cannot  be  withdrawn  without  the  permission  of  the  House.  It  must  not
be  forgotten  that  unless  a  speech  is  made  objecting  to  a  motion,  neither  mover
nor  secon<ler  can  speak  a  second  time,  except  in  e.xplanation.  If,  however,  a
debate  does  a  ise,  in  which  an  opposition  is  given  to  the  mover  of  a  motion,  he
has  the  riiiht  of  r^'ply  ;  but  it  must  be  understood  that  tliis  privilege  does  not
belorg  to  the  mover  of  an  amendment.  All  are  permitted  to  explain.  The
debate  being  ende  1.  the  Speaker  or  Chaiiman  puts  the  question,  and  calls  upon
thoi^e  in  favor  to  say  "Aye."  and  those  of  a  contrarj'  opinion  to  say  "No."  He
then  declares  tliat  in  liis  opinion  the  ''Ayes"  or  the  "Noes  "  (as  the  case  may
be)  have  it.  If  his  decision  is  questionefi,  the  House  divide",  the  "  Ayes"  rising
and  their  names  being  taken  down  ;  the  "Noes"  following;  the  numberu  are
counted  from  the  recortl,  and  declared.  When  an  amendment  has  l)een  moved,
the  vote  is  simply  taken  on  the  amendment,  and  then  on  the  original  question.
Should  the  amendment  b^  adopted,  it  tlien  becomes  the  substantive  motion,  and
may  l)e  amended  in  the  smie  way  that  the  original  motion  was  amended.  Thus
a  numl)er  of  successive  amendments  to  the  original  motion  may  be  disposed  of.
Any  member  is  at  liberty  to  interrupt  another  by  "rising  to  order;"  which
means  that  lie  rises  in  his  place,  and  calls  the  attention  of  the  Chair  and  the

House,  to  a  breach  of  the  orders  then  being  committed.     In  debate,  it  is  con-    i
trary  to  order  to  mention  any  member  l)y  name ;  the  same  rule  i)revails  in  Com-
mittee of  the  Whole,  except  as  regards  the  Chairmnn,  who  is  cnlled  by  his  name
and  not  Mr.  Chairman.  '
Originating  Bills. — All  Bills  relating  to  public  income  and  expenditure,  and
all  Bills  usually  called  Money  BjUs,  mu.st  originate  in  the  Commons,  and  be
introduced  by  the  Government.     (For  fuller  details  see  Bills.)
Privilegks  of  Parliament. — There  are  three  kinds.
1st.  The  privileges  which  appertain  to  members  individually.
2nd.  These  which  belong  to  the  House  in  its  collective  capacity.
3rd.  These  which  belong  to  the  House  jointly.
Amongst  the  privileges  which  the  Commons  claim,  are  : —
The  power  of  committing  individuals  to  prison — the  power  of  publishing
matters  which,  if  not  issuing  from  sucli  high  authority,  miglit  become  the  sub-
ject of  proceedings  in  a  Court  of  Law, — the  power  of  directing  the  Law  (Jfficcrs
of  the  Crown  to  prosecute  persons  accused  of  offences  against  the  laws,  oi-  affect-
ing the  privileges  of  Parliament, — and  finally  of  doing  anything  not  directly
contravening  an  existing  Act  of  Parliament,  which  may  be  necessary  for  the
vindication  and  protection  of  its  own  rights,  in  the  exercise  of  its  own  constitu-
tional functions.  Questions  of  |)rivilege  take  precedence  of  all  other  proceed-
ings, and  are  alwa3's  in  order.  The  privileges  claimed  by  individual  mcnihers
are — freedom  of  speech  and  person,  including  freedom  from  legal  arrests  and
seizure  under  process  from  the  Courts  of  Law  and  equity.  Tliis  does  not  extend
to  indictable  offences  or  to  actual  contempts  of  the  Courts  of  .Justice.  Memlu  is
of  Parliament  are  exempt  from  all  duties,  the  perfoimance  of  which  might
interfere  with  their  prompt  attendance  to  their  Parliamentary  calls.  I'riviUge
of  Parliament,  such  as  it  is,  continues  for  a  convenient  time  after  prorogation
and  dissolution.
Royal  Assent. — The  Act  by  which  the  Crown  agrees  to  a  Bill  is  called  the
Royal  Assent ;  this  assent  is  usually  given  at  the  end  of  a  Hession,  unless  tliere
is  urgent  necessity  for  the  Act  becoming  Law  without  loss  of  time,  in  which  case
the  Governor  General,  or  the  person  administei-ing  tlie  Government,  comes  down
to  the  Upper  House,  and  there,  in  the  presence  of  both  Houses,  gives  his  assent.
When  this  is  done,  either  at  the  close  of  the  Session  or  on  a  special  occasion,
the  Governor  General  being  seated  on  the  throne,  the  House  of  ('omnmns  is
summoned  to  the  bar  of  the  Upper  House :  being  there,  the  Clerk  or  Clerk
Assistant  reads  the  title  of  the  Bill,  and  hands  it  to  the  Chief  Clerk,  who  says  in
both  English  and  French  :  "In  the  name  of  Her  Majesty  the  Queen,  His  Excel-
"  lency  the  Governor  General  sanctions  tliis  Bill,"'  to  which  His  Excellency  mani-
fests his  assent.  Bills  to  which  the  Royal  assent  is  not  given,  are  not  noticed,  but
are  mentioned  in  tlie  "  Official  Gazette"'  as  having  been  reservi^I  for  Her
Majesty"s  consideration.  Unless  a  reserve  is  made  in  the  Act  itself,  as  soon  as
the  RojJ^al  Assent  is  given,  the  Act  becomes  a  law,  and  can  be  proceeded  on
before  any  competent  Court.
"5ergeant-at-Akms. — This  officer,  although  in  attendance  on  tlie  House  of
Comi.Mons,  is  ajipointed  by  the  Crown.  It  is  his  duty  to  oliey  the  commands  of
the  House,  to  apprehend  and  take  into  custody  all  thost^  who  are  committed  for
any  ott'ence  by  the  House.  All  the  messengers  and  servants  of  the  House,
except  the  Clerks,  are  under  his  orders.  He  has  his  seat  at  the  Bar  of  the
House,  and  directs  all  arrangements  for  the  mahitenance  of  order  in  tlie
approaches  to,  or  the  galleries  of  the  House.  He  is  of  course  in  immeiliatc
attendance  ui:)on  the  Speaker,  from  whcm  he  takes  all  orders,  connect(>d  with
his  duties.
Session. — The  Session  is  the  term  occupied  by  Parhament  from  its  com-
mencement to  its  prorogation.     An  adjournment  does  not  close  a  Session.     I'ar-
44
PRACTICr;   C  PARLIAMENT.
liament  is  annually  assembled  for  the  despatch  of  business.  There  are  certain
important  acts  which  arc  renewed  every  year,  and  without  which  the  Govern-
ment could  not  be  carried  on,  which  compels  the  Government  to  meet  the  Repre-
sentatives of  the  people,  and  render  an  account  of  the  past  year's  transactions,
once  a  year  at  least.  Unless  this  be  done,  there  will  bo  no  supplies.  By  an
understanding.  Parliament  meets  in  the  month  of  February,  although  circum-
stances sometimes  arise  to  postpone  the  time.  While  the  Crown  has  a  right  to
summon  Parliament  where  it  pleases,  it  is  generally  understood  that  it  assembles
at  the  Seat  of  Government.  Tlie  House  being  assembled,  the  Governor  General
commands  the  attendance  of  the  Members  of  the  Lower  House  at  the  Bar  of
the  Upper  House,  and  delivers  a  Speech  from  the  Throne.  This  Speech  is  the
first  subject  taken  into  consideration ;  no  other  business  is  commenced  until  the
answer  to  it  is  given.  As  is  stated  elsewhere,  the  mere  fact  of  one  or  both
Houses  adjourning,  does  not  terminate  the  Session;  it  can  only  terminate  by
being  prorogued  by  the  Crown.  All  bills  and  other  measures  left  unfinished,
when  the  prorogation  takes  place,  are  dead,  and  parties  who  wish  to  revive
tlicm,  must  recommence  their  labours  at  the  next  Session,  as  if  nothing  had
been  done  in  the  piemises.  The  mere  assembling  of  Members  does  not  consti-
tute a  Session, — ono  Bill,  at  least,  must  pass  both  Houses,  and  receive  the  Royal
Assent,  before  it  can  be  called  a  Session.
Si'KAKER. — Beyond  all  doubt  this  officer  was  designated  L  weaker,  from  the
fact  of  his  being  the  mouth  \nece  of  the  Commons,  in  their  ntercourse  with
tlio  Crown.  He  is  the  presiding  officer  of  the  body.  He  read.-  ill  communica-
tions which  come  from  the  Queen's  Representative  to  the  Commons;  he  has  to
jiresent  and  read  such  addresses  and  petitions  as  are  carried  up  to  the  Governor
General  by  the  whole  House,  and  to  deliver  the  usual  speeches,  on  the  part  of
the  Commons,  when  presenting  the  Supply  Bill,  and  other  Bills,  calling  for  par-
ticular note  and  remark.  Through  him,  all  witnesses  sxv.d  prisoners  at  the  Bar
of  the  House  are  examined,  and  he  directs  all  arrangements,  when  the  House
is  to  be  addressed  by  Counsel.  It  is  his  duty  to  deliver  the  reprimand  of  the
House  to  any  one  who  has  incurred  the  penalty  of  receiving  it :  it  is  also  his
duty  to  issue  warrants  of  committal,  or  release  for  breach  of  privilege,  to  com-
municate with  any  parties,  when  so  instructed  by  the  House.  It  is  his  duty  to
closely  examine  the  provisions  of  private  Bills  so  as  to  protect  the  public  against
any  surprise,  or  undue  encroachment  or  injury ;  to  control  and  regulate  the
conduct  of  subordinate  officers  of  the  House ;  to  enforce  the  Rules  of  the
House  ;  he  cannot  join  in  any  debate  unless  in  Committee  of  the  whole  House,
As  the  presiding  officer  of  the  House,  he  has  all  the  duties  attached  to  such  an
office.  The  Speaker  is  chosen  by  the  membei's  of  Parliament,  subject  to  the
apiirobation  of  tlie  Representative  of  the  Crown,  and  holds  his  office  imtil  the
Parliament  in  which  he  is  elected  is  dissolved.  Should  a  member  persevere  in
disobeying  the  order  of  the  Speaker  and  of  the  House,  the  Speaker  may
'•name  him,"  as  the  term  aj^plies,  a  course  imiformly  followed  by  the  censure
of  tlie  House.     In  extreme  cases,  the  Speaker  may  oriler  members  or  others
I  into  custody,  until  the  pleasure  of  the  House  be  signified.  On  divisions,  when
tlie  numbers  happen  to  be  equal,  he  gives  the  casting  vote,  but  he  never  other-
,  wise  votes.
!  SuPrLY. — All  i^roceedings  which  relate  to  the  public  income  or  expendituie,
must  originate  with  the  Conunons,  and  must  be  begun  by  resolution  moved  in
j  Conunittee  of  Supply,  which  is  always  a  Committee  of  the  whole  House.   In  the
j  course  of  the  St\''sion.  estimate-     are  submitted  to  a  Committee  of  Supply  ;  and
ivsolutions  moved  thereon,  grat  ting  to  the  Crown  the  sums  requisite  for  the
management  of  the  various  departments  of  the  (lOvernnient,  and  the  support
j  of  various  i)ublic  and  piivate  institutions.     Such  as  are  confirmed  l^y  the  Com-
j  mittoeof  Supjily  are  reported  to  the  House,  where  they  are  again  reconsidered
!  and  adopted,  or  rejected,  as  the  case  may  be.     Upon  these  a  Bill  is  passed,  and
this  Supjtly  Bill  furnishes  the  authority  to  the  <jovemment  for  disbursing  the
PRACTICE   OF  PARLIAMENT,
45
various  sums  appropriated.  The  Upper  House  may  reject  this  or  any  other
money  Bill,  but  they  cannot  alter  or  amend  the  substance  of  a  supply  or  money
Bill ;  such  a  course  would  be  regarded  as  an  invasion  of  the  Privileges  of  the
Lower  House.  Before  any  Bill  can  be  introduced,  authorizing  the  expenditure
of  any  public  money,  resolutions  must  be  moved  in  Committee  of  Supply,  agreed
to  there,  reported,  and  confirmed  by  the  House.
Ways  and  Means. — As  the  Committee  of  Supply  relates  to  the  expenditure
of  the  country,  so  the  functions  and  duties  of  a  Committee  of  Ways  and  Means
have  reference  to  the  funds  by  which  such  expenditure  is  to  be  met.  Loans,
duties,  taxes,  excise  and  revenue  of  every  description,  are  submitted  to  a  Com-
mittee of  Ways  and  Means.  The  propositions  of  Government  on  this  subject
are  reduced  to  resolutions,  submitted,  considered,  and  decided  on,  and  such  as
are  agreed  to  are  reported  to  the  House.  Those  which  may  be  a<lopted  are
embodied  iu  a  Bill  or  Bills,  and  in  due  course  and  form  become  the  Law  of  the
land.  As  in  Supply,  the  Upper  House  may  reject  these  Bills,  but  cannot  amend
them ;  nor  can  the  Upper  House  insert  a  pecuniary  penalty  in  any  Bill.
AREA  AND  BOUNDARIES
Of  the  Dominion  of  Canada,  and  the  Provinces  of  Prince  Edward  Island  and
Newfoundland.
Canada,  New  Brunswick,  Nova  Scotia,  Prince  Edward  Island  and  Newfound-
land occupy  an  immense  extent  of  territory;  St.  Johns,  Newfoundland,  the  most
easterly  capital,  being  26°  80'  East  and  9°  North  of  Toronto,  the  most  westerly ;
the  distance  between  the  two  being  considerably  over  KKK)  miles.  These  coun-
tries, however,  all  belong  to  one  geographical  district,  which  may  be  called  the
Laurentian,  each  claiming  a  portion  of  the  shores  of  the  Gulf  of  St.  Lawrence,
the  Colonial  Mediterranean.
Canada  lies  principally  on  the  North  side  of  the  St.  Lawrence,  and  the  North
and  East  sides  of  Lakes  Ontario,  Erie,  Hvu-on  and  Superior.  In  part,  also,  on  the
South  side  of  the  St.  Lawrence,  stretching  fi'om  near  Montreal  to  the  Bay  of
Chaleurs.  Its  northerly  and  westerly  boundaries  have  not  been  fixed.  It  is
bounded  on  the  South  by  the  territories  of  the  United  States  and  New  Brunswick.
The  area  of  Canada  is  given  in  official  returns  as  331,  280  square  miles,  being  121,
260  for  Ontario,  and  210,020  for  Quebec.
New  Bi'unswick  is  bounded  by  Quebec,  the  Gulf  of  St.  Lawrence,  Nova  Scotia,
the  Bay  of  Fundy  and  the  LTnited  States,  being  divided  from  the  latter  by  the
St.  C'roix  River.     Its  area  is  27,105  square  miles.
Nova  Scotia  is  a  peninsula  connected  with  New  Brunswick  by  a  low  sandy
isthmus.  It  is  about  300  miles  long,  and  about  100  miles  broad  at  its  widest.
The  island  of  Cape  Breton  is  now  a  part  of  Nova  Scotia,  the  Gut  of  Canso,  which
divides  them,  being  less  than  a  mile  in  breadth.  The  coast  of  Nova  Scotia  is
everywhere  indented  with  arms  of  the  sea,  and  no  part  of  it  is  more  than  20
miles  from  salt  water.     Area,  including  Cape  Breton,  18,660  squares  miles.
Prince  Edward  Island  is  about  140  miles  long  and  34  in  its  greatest  breadth.
Its  coasts  are  like  those  of  Nova  Scotia,  much  indented  by  bays,  and  no  part  is
more  than  10  miles  from  the  sea.  L^nlike  Nova  Scotia,  which  has  a  rock-bound
shore.     Area,  2,100  square  miles.
The  greatest  length  of  Newfoundland  is,  from  North  to  South,  SoO  miles  ;
average  breadth,  130.     Coast  bold  and  rocky.     Area,  40,200  square  miles.

If  to  this  be  atlded  the  area  of  Vancouver's  Island,  20,000  square  miles  ;
British  Columbia  220,(XX)  square  miles  ;  and  Labrador,  the  Hudson's  Bay,  and
North  West  Territories  with,  say  2,750,000  square  miles,  we  have  a  total  for
British  North  America  of  no  less  than  3,389,345  square  miles.
The  cUmate  and  productions  of  the  Colonies  are  more  dissimilar  than  might
be  inferred  from  the  latitude  of  their  settled  districts.  In  the  extreme  West
of  Ontario,  Indian  Corn  can  be  raised  with  profit ;  peaches,  grapes  and
melons  grow  luxuriantly  in  the  open  air ;  but  the  district  favored  thus  is  small,
and  although  the  greater  part  of  Canada  is  a  magnificient  region  for  growing  all
the  cereals,  while  wheat  can  be  raised  with  care  in  every  settled  part  of  every
colony,  we  find  by  the  time  we  travel  ftirther  Eastward  than  Quebec,  that  the
people  depend  less  and  less  upon  the  soil,  until  in  Newfoundland  they  are  almost
exclusively  concerned  about  the  waters  and  buy  from  other  countries  almost
all  their  cereal  and  animal  food.  The  winter's  cold  varies  even  more  than  the
summer's  heat.  Snow  rarely  lies  more  than  a  month  in  the  West  of  Ontario.
In  some  parts  of  Quebec  East  and  the  Labrador,  it  lies  for  five  or  six  months,
every  season.
The  diversity  of  the  mineral  resources  of  the  several  colonies  is  no  less  than
that  of  their  agricultural  productions.  The  western  peninsula  of  Ontario
as  yet  alone  yields  petroleum ;  it  has  many  valuable  quarries,  but  few  metallic
ores.  Those,  however,  the  shores  of  the  upper  Lakes,  Central  and  Eastern
Canada,  Nova  Scotia,  and  probably  Newfoundland  and  New  Brunswick,  abun-
dantly supply.  Especially  valuable  are  the  copper  mines  of  Canada  and  New-
foundland, and  the  gold  and  coal  of  Nova  Scotia.  Prince  Edward  Island  is  the
worst  off"  in  tliis  particular.
This  diversity  is,  however,  a  happy  thing  for  all  the  Provinces.  While  the
general  severity  of  their  climate  enforces  activity  among  their  people,  the  variety
of  their  resources  prevents  their  inhabitants  from  confining  themselves  to  one
branch  of  industry.  Their  wants,  and  the  commodities  with  which  to  pay  for
the  supply  of  these  wants,  being  different,  they  contain  within  themselves  tlie
germs  of  a  trade  among  themselves,  which,  when  freed  from  artificial  restrictions,
and  enabled  to  flow  in  improved  channels,  maysomedayattain  vast  proportions,
rivallmg  and  exceeding  their  already  extensive  commerce  with  foreign  nations.

CUBRENCY  AND  COINAGE.
CANADA.
By  the  Consolidated  Statutes  of  Canada,  cap.  xv.,  the  dollar  is  defined  to
be  one  fourth  of  a  pound,  the  cent  one  hundredth  of  a  dollar,  tlie  mill  one  tenth
of  a  cent ;  and  it  is  declared  that  any  statement  as  to  money  value  may  be  made
either  in  pounds,  shillings  and  pence,  or  in  dollars,  cents  and  mills.
The  I'ublic  Accounts  have  been  kept  in  dollars  and  cents  since  1858.
The  pound  currency,  usually  called  **  Halifax  currency,"  although  it  is  not
the  currency  of  Halifax,  is  *' one  hundred  and  one  grains  and  three  hundred
"  and  twenty-one  thousandths  of  a  grain,  Troy  weight,  of  gold  of  the  standard  of
"  fineness  prescribed  by  law  for  the  gold  coins  of  the  United  Kingdom  on  the
**  first  day  of  August,  1854."  And  "any  gold  coins  of  the  standard  of  fineness
"  aforesaid  which  Her  Majesty  directs  to  be  struck  at  the  Royal  Mint,"  area
legal  tender  in  projiortion  to  their  weight.
The  pound  sterling  (Victoria  Sovereign)  which  contains  0.91,606  of  pure
gold,  and  weighs  lli3.3  grains  is  therefore  declared  equal  to  and  legal  tender  for
£1  4s.  4d.,  or  |4.86|.
The  gold  Eagle  of  the  United  States  coined  before  July  1834,  is  legal  for
$10.66|or£2  13s.  4d.,  but  if  coined  between  that  date  and  1st  January  18.>2,
or  as  long  after  as  the  standard  of  fineness  fixed  by  the  laws  of  tin-  United
States  be  not  changed,  then  only  for  $10.00  or  £2  lOs.  Od.  The  gold  coins  of
the  United  States  being  "  multiples  or  halves  of  the  said  Eagle,"  are  legal  for
proportionate  sums.
Other  foreign  gold  coins  may  be,  but  have  not  been  made  legal  by  procla-
mation.
British  silver  coins  "  of  the  fineness  fixed  by  law  on  1st  August,  1854,  and
"  of  weights  bearing  respectively  the  same  i>roportion  to  the  value  to  be  assigned
"  to  such  coins  in  this  Pi-ovince  which  the  weights  of  the  silver  coins  of  the
"  United  Kingdom  bore  on  the  said  day  to  the  value  assigned  to  them  in  the
"  United  Kingdom  shall,  by  such  names  as  Her  Majesty  may  assign  to  them  in
"  Uer  Royal  Proclamation,  declaring  them  lawful  money  of  this  Province,  pass
"  current  and  be  a  legal  tender  at  the  rates  assigned  to  them  respectively  in
"  such  proclamation."  Until  otherwise  ordei-ed  these  silver  coins  '*  .shall  pass
"  current  in  this  Province  for  sums  in  currency  equal,  according  to  the  propor-
"  tion  hereinbefore  fixed,  to  the  sums  in  sterling  for  which  they  respectively
"  pass  current  in  the  United  Kingdom."
Thus  the  British  shilling  is  a  legal  tender  for  $0.24i.
No  foreign  silver  coin  is  lawful  money  ;  and  British  silver  is  only  legal
tender  to  the  extent  of  $10.
The  copper  coins  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  a  h.^al  tender  to  the  amount
of  twenty  cents  or  one  shilling  currency  ;  the  jJenny  for  two  cents,  and  subdivi-
sions thereof  in  proportion.
The  pence  and  half- pence  still  current  in  Canada  were  imported  by  the
Banks.  The  Government  has  within  the  last  few  years  imported  both  silver  and
and  bronze  coins  ;  twenty,  ten  and  five  cent  pieces  of  silver,  and  one  cent  pieces
of  bronze.  The  following  statement  shows  the  amount  of  the  importation,  the
whole  of  which  was  taken  by  the  Banks  of  tlie  Province  at  par,  with  the  excep-
tion of  .*4,000  in  cent  i3ieces,  sold  to  the  Province  of  New  Brunswick  : —

In  general  practice,  both  American  quarters  and  British  shillings  are  taken
in  shojis  in  Canada  for  twenty-five  cents,  goods  being  "marked  up"  accordingly,
and  tnulesmen  frequently  give  a  premium  for  Bank  Bills.
American  silver  has  therefore  been  imported  in  large  quantities,  and  several
million  dollars  worth  of  it  are  in  circulation  in  the  Province.
In  Post  Offices  and  Bank?,  Canatlian  coin  is  the  only  silver  taken  at  its  face
value,  the  consequence  of  which  is  that  almost  all  our  silver  coin  is  locked  up
in  the  vaults  of  the  several  Banks.
The  paper  money  of  Canada  has  been  until  of  late  exclusively  issued  by  the
Banks,  and  is  of  the  denominations  of  $1,  $2,  $4,  $5,  $10,$20,  $50,  $100.
NEW  BRUNSWICK.
The  New  Brunswick  legal  dollar  is  the  same  as  that  of  Canada,  bearing  the
same  relation  to  the  English  sovereign.  The  Bank  notes  are  of  denominations
as  low  as  $1,  and  are  considered  equal  to  gold.
The  coins  imported  by  the  Province  are  of  the  same  denominations  as  those
of  Canada  ;  viz  :  20,  10  and  5  cent  pieces,  of  silver,  and  one  cent  of  bronze.  The
Government  made  two  importations — the  first  of  $30,011.00  in  shillings;
$15,012.90  in  six  pences  ;  $5,(X)2.75  in  three  pences,  and  $3,000.00  in  cents.
The  second  was  of  $44,985.35  in  silver  coins  in  about  the  same  proportion,  and
of$9,980.87  in  copper.  Total  face  value  $107,992.87,  total  cost  £9,872  17s.  lid.
sterling.
These  coins  are  now  the  common  metallic  currency  of  the  Province,  the
American  silver  quarter  being  taken  for  20  cents  only,  and  the  British  sliilling
being  legal  only  as  24  cents,  which  is  below  their  intrinsic  value,  and  therefore
drives  them  out  of  circulation.

NOVA  SCOTIA.
The  sovereign  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  equal  to  five  dollars  in  the  currency
of  Nova  Scotia.  The  doubloon,  if  not  less  weight  than  415  grains  and  containing
not  less  tlian  360  grains  of  pure  gold  is  $16.
Tlie  Peruvian,  Mexicaij,  Columbian  and  old  Spanish  dollars,  of  the  full
weight  of  416  grains  and  containing  not  less  than  373  grains  of  pure  silver  are
legal  for  4s.  2d.  sterling  or  $1 .04.  The  silver  coins  of  tlie  United  Kingdom  are
legal  tender,  to  the  extent  of  $10,  at  the  following  rates  :
The  Crown,  $1.25;  the  half  Crown,  $0  62^;  the  florin,  $0.50;  the  shilling,
$0.25;  the  six  pence,  $0.12^;  the  four  pence,  $0.08.
No  other  silver  coin  is  legal  tender,  but  the  American  "  quarter  "  passes
current  at  22^  cents.
The  copper  coin  of  the  Province  is  the  only  legal  tender  in  copper,  and
then  only  to  the  extent  of  25  cents.
All  Public  Accounts  are  kept  and  all  judgments  must  be  entered  and
executions  taken  out  in  dollars  and  cents.
CLHUENCY   AND   COINAfiE.
49
Tho  Province  has  issued  no  silver  coins.  It  has  called  in  its  old  issue  of
pence  and  halfpence,  and  substituted  an  issue  of  hronze  cents  an<l  half  cents  to
the  face  value  of  $17,903,  of  which  about  $2,(H)0  are  in  half  cents
The  Statutes  declare  that  "  any  person  issuing  as  circulating  cuirency  any
"  promissory  note  or  bank  note  or  bill  for  a  less  sum  than  $20  shall  for  every

8niall  notes,  and  the  Treasury  notes,  which  are  of  the  denominations  of  !f4  and
$5,  are  in  demand.  Their  amount  in  circulation  at  the  end  of  .Fune,  JcSiiO,  was
$502,488.  They  are  not  a  legal  tender,  except  ft)r  duties,  while  on  the  other

PIUNCE   EinVAUD  ISLAND.
The  currency  of  Prince  E<lward  Island  is  more  complex  than  that  of  any  of
the  other  North  American  Colonies.
By  12  Victoria,  chapter  24,  the  British  sovereign  is  a  legal  ternhn-  at  thirty
shillings  island  currency,  and  British  silver  in  proportion.
The  American  Eagle  ($10)  is  legal  at  £3  currency,  aliquot  parts  in  projjor-
tion.
British  gold  is  therefore  more  abundant  in  the  Island  than  American.
The  gold  doubloon  of  not  less  than  415  grains  is  legal  at  £4  16s.
The  United  States,  Peruvian,  Chilian  and  Spanish  milled  dollars  and  the
dollar  of  Central  America  being  of  not  less  weight  than  412  grains  are  legal  at
6s.  3d.  Island  currency,  and  aliquot  parts  in  proportion.
The  French  five  franc  piece  is  legal  at  5s.  6d. ;  and  its  subdivisions  at  the
same  rate.
Copper  coins  legally  current  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada  and  New
Brunswick  are  legal  in  Prince  Edward  Island,  penny  for  penny.  But  a  British
half  penny  is  not  legal  for  more  than  a  half  penny,  though  worth  nearly  as  much
as  an  Island  penny.
The  Public  Accounts  are  kept  partly  in  Island  currency,  partly  in  sterling.
The  Prince  Edward  Island  Government  has  coined  no  money,  unless  we
take  into  account  its  Treasury  bills  of  5s.  and  multiples.  The  Banks  have  issued
a  few  copj)er  coins.

The  British  Sovereign,  legal  tender  for $4.80  currency.
Tho  Gold  Eagle  (U.  S.)    "         "  " 9.85         *'
The  Silver  Coins  of  the  United  Kingdom  legal  tender  for  sums  in  currency

POST  OFFICE  SAVINGS  BANKS.
!!'
THE  Post  Office  Savings  Banks,  established  by  Statute  in  tho  present  Session
of  Parliament,  will  commence  operations  on  the  1st  APRIL,  1868,  and  the
Postmaster-General  will,  from  that  day,  receive  at  any  of  the  undermentioned
Post  Offices  deposits  paid  to  the  Postmasters  by  persons  wishing  to  place  their
money  in  the  Government  Savings  Banks.
2.  The  direct  security  of  the  Dominion  is  given  by  the  Statute  for  all  deposits
made.
3.  At  each  Post  Office  named,  the  Savings  Bank  regulations  may  bo  read  by
the  public,  giving  full  information  with  res^iect  to  the  mode  of  dejDOsiting  and
withdrawing  money,  and  these  regulations  are  printed  on  the  cover  of  the  Pass
Book  supplied  to  each  depositor.
4.  Any  person  may  have  a  deposit  account,  and  deposits  will  be  received
daily,  during  the  ordinary  hours  of  Post  Office  Ijusiness,  of  any  number  of  dollars,
from  $1  uji  to  $300,  the  total  amount  which  can  be  received  from  a  Depositor  in
any  one  year,  except  in  cases  to  be  specially  authorized  by  the  Postmaster-General.
5.  The  Postmasters  of  the  offices  named  will  act  as  agents  for  the  receipt  of
the  money  deposited  for  transmission  to  the  Postmaster-General,  and  for  tho
payment  by  tho  Postmaster-General  of  money  withdrawn  by  Depositors.
6.  Each  Depositor  will  be  supplied  with  a  Pass  Book,  and  the  sums  paid  in,
or  witiidrawn,  will  be  entered  therein  by  the  Postmaster  receiving  or  paying  the
same.  In  addition,  a  direct  receipt  for  each  amoimt  paid  in,  will  be  sent  to  the
Depositor  from  the  Postmaster-General,  and  the  Postmaster-General  will  issue  a
cheque,  payable  at  any  Post  Office  Savings  Bank  desired,  for  any  sum  withdrawn.
7.  Every  Depositor's  account  will  thus  be  kept  with  the  Postmaster-General,
and  a  Depositor  may  pay  into  his  or  her  account  with  the  Post  Office  Savings
Bank,  at  any  of  the  Savings  Bank  Post  Offices  which  at  the  time  may  best  suit  his
convenience,  and  may  exercise  the  same  choice  in  drawing  out  money,  su1>ject
only  to  the  obligation  of  producing  the  Pass  Book,  in  proof  of  identity — when-
ever paying  in  or  drawing  out  money.
8.  Interest  at  the  rate  of  4  per  cent,  per  annum  will  be  allowed  on  de])Osits
lying  in  the  ordinary  deposit  accounts,  but  when  a  Depositor  has  !{!]0 )  deiiosited,
he  or  slxe  may  request  the  Postmaster-General  to  transfer  this  sum  to  a  special
account,  and  will  then  receive  a  Certificate  of  such  special  $100  deposit,  bearing
interest  at  5  per  cent,  per  annum.
9.  Postmasters  are  forbidden  by  law  to  disclose  the  name  of  any  Depositor,  or
the  amount  of  any  sum  deposited  or  withdrawn.
10.  No  charge  will  be  made  to  Depositors  on  paying  in,  or  drawing  out  money,
nor  for  postage  on  communications  with  the  Postmaster-General  in  relation
thereto.
11.  The  Postmaster-General  will  be  always  ready  to  receive  and  attend  to  all
applications,  complaints,  or  other  communications  addressed  to  him  by  Dejio-
sitors  or  others,  relative  to  Post  Office  Savings  Bank  matters.

CANCERS  CURED
By  a  new,  but  certain,  speedy,  and  nearly  painless  process,  and  without
the  use  of  the  knife.    The  cure  will  be  guaranteed,  and,  as  a
proof  of  this,  no  pay  is  required,  until  the  cure  is  complete.
The  moment  a  cancer  is  discovered,  it  should  be  cured
as  it  will  cost  less  and  is  more  speedily  cured  than
when  of  longer  standing,  and  there  is  nothing
to  gain,  and  everything  to  lose  by  delay.
What  now  seems  a  harmless  lump  in
the  breast,  neck,  eye-lid  or  else-
where, or  small  wart  or  sore  on
the  lip,  may,  in  a  few  short  months,
become  a  hideous,  disgusting,  destroying  mass  of
disease.    If  required,  references  can  be  given  to  parties
who  have  been  cured  many  years  since,  and  who  are  now  sound
and  healthy.
