High Priority Projects List: MoDOT announces $13 million in bike/ped projects
Fri, 05/06/2011 - 12:55am
Here is a story about how your support of the Missouri Bicycle & Pedestrian Federation and bicycle and pedestrian advocacy in Missouri has made a dramatic improvement for bicycling and walking--and how MoDOT is changing for the better.
Complete Streets advocacy
Advocacy groups across Missouri, led by the Missouri Bicycle and Pedestrian Federation, have been working for several years for a statewide Complete Streets policy.  A statewide Complete Streets policy is a top goal in MoBikeFed's Vision of Bicycling and Walking in Missouri and in the draft Trailmap for Bicycling and Walking developed in the mid 2000s.
We have supported a Complete Streets bill in the Missouri General Assembly and also encouraged MoDOT to adopt Complete Streets policies through their internal engineering policies.
And MoDOT has come a long way--in the mid 1990s, the agency's entire bicycle and pedestrian policy was only a few sentences long.  MoDOT's bicycle and pedestrian policies were improved dramatically in the early 2000s.  Under the leadership of current MoDOT Nonmotorized Transportation Engineer, Melissa Anderson, the pedestrian and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) policies have been improved again in the past eighteen months.

Bicyclist killed crossing Paseo Bridge near downtown Kansas City
Mon, 05/25/2009 - 11:36pm
A bicyclist was killed while apparently trying to cross the I-35 Paseo Bridge over the Missouri River near downtown Kansas City, Missouri, early this morning.The man was apparently struck by a semi-truck while bicycling on one of the approaches to the bridge.This man--so far un-named--joins recent fatalities of bicyclists and pedestrians on and near the Heart of America Bridge and the Broadway Bridge near downtown Kansas City, Missouri.None of these bridges have the type of good, safe, bicycle and pedestrian facilities that are now commonplace on bridges in metropolitan areas across America.Working on safe bicycle/pedestrian river crossings for over a decadeMoBikeFed has been working in cooperation with a large group of local bicycle, pedestrian, and community groups in the Kansas City area to create safe bicycle and pedestrian river crossings in this area where none currently exist.Most recently, the opportunity was to create a new, safe river crossing with the new Paseo Bridge, currently under construction.Under pressure of some dozens of groups and organizations, including the Kansas City, Missouri, City Council, the Mid-America Regional Council, and thousands of citizens, MoDOT has agreed to do work on one or possibly two nearby bridges, including the Heart of America Bridge and possibly the Chouteau Bridge.New Paseo Bridge to be built without bicycle/pedestrian accessHowever an opportunity has been lost in not including a good, safe, bicycle/pedestrian crossing as part of the initial construction of the Paseo Bridge.This is doubly a shame because there will be plenty of deck space on the new bridge itself for a barrier-separated bicycle/pedestrian path--the bridge is being built to accommodate two extra motor vehicle lanes and a bicycle/pedestrian path in the future.   For now, all that extra space will just being striped off as extra-wide shoulders and medians.MoDOT pledged to design and build the Paseo Bridge so that a bike/ped path can, theoretically, be added in the future.  However they chose not to do the design work needed to actually add the bicycle/pedestrian path during initial construction--or even make it so the bicycle/pedestrian path could be added easily within a year or two.The result is that adding the bike/ped path will cost some millions more in the future than it would have if built in right from the start. Adding the bicycle path will be difficult and disruptive because it will require slight adjustments to every lane and barrier all across the bridge.And--as this tragic death shows--people need to cross the river on foot and on bicycle right now, not in some misty, long distant future.Why would anyone bicycle or walk across the Paseo Bridge now?When MoBikeFed was part of the river crossing task force convened to study the options for creating safe bicycle & pedestrian river crossings in the area, we analyzed the current need and the barriers to safe bicycling and walking in the area, which is one of the most densely populated in Missouri.Here are some of the results:The area immediately around the Paseo Bridge consists of a large number of disconnected "travelsheds".  In the graphic below, these travelsheds are shown as areas of different color.  Each different color is isolated from the others by some man-made or natural barrier--river, highway, railroad tracks, etc. You can get from one travelshed to another with a car, but in many cases not (safely) on bicycle or on foot:The highest concentration of households without a car ("zero-car households") in the Kansas City area is along I-35 just to the south of the Missouri river. Among the highest concentrations of jobs and industry are downtown and just to the north of the river along I-35.Because of all the interstate freeways, other state and federal highways, railroad tracks, and rivers, the area near downtown Kansas City is very difficult for bicycling and walking, with many small, disconnected areas.The bicyclist killed today was most likely traveling from the yellow area, just south of the Missouri River on I-35/US-71 to the red area just north of the river.This maps shows connections between these various travelsheds made best (or only) via the Paseo Bridge:More information and photos about bicycle and pedestrian access in this area here.Creating better, safer access across major barriers like rivers is one of the most important steps in creating a more complete bicycle/pedestrian transportation system in Missouri, and one of the goals in MoBikeFed's Vision of Bicycling and Walking in Missouri.

Put People on Paseo Campaign in Kansas City Star; Boneheaded MoDOT comments drive me to pledge another $1000
Tue, 11/18/2008 - 6:00am
KCStar:Circle the correct answer: The new Paseo Bridge WILL/WILL NOT have a bicycle and walking lane when the $245 million Missouri River crossing opens in 2011.The answer — WILL NOT — is a shocker to many, particularly in this era of “green solutions,” “transit options” and “urban trail construction.”Some bicycle enthusiasts are so distraught they’ve created a homemade pledge drive. The money might be a drop in the bucket, but they figure any effort is better than inaction in the face of what they consider backward urban planning.Reading this article--and particularly the quotes from MoDOT officials--made me so mad I just went and personally pledged another $500 $1000 to the Put People on Paseo campaign.Read on for the reason . . .Bicyclists and pedestrians make the case; MoDOT stonewallsMoBikeFed has been involved in this issue for about the past four years. The Paseo Bridge project is a quarter billion dollar project, one of only three major projects in the state cleared for the new "design-build" process.Bicyclists and pedestrians have attended every public meeting from the time the project was publicly announced, and carefully and clearly detailed the important bicycle and pedestrian connections the Paseo Bridge would create--connections which would not and could not be created by adding a bicycle/pedestrian path to any other nearby bridge.Frankly, in each and every case talking to MoDOT has been like talking to a mud wall.They don't want to hear it, they don't want to acknowledge it.So they simply don't.The Paseo Bridge is at the heart of a major urban areaThe Paseo Bridge is precisely in the heart of the Kansas City metro area, in the most densely populated portion of the urban core.On any given day, over 150,000 people are living or working within the 7.5 square mile area immediately surrounding the bridge.The way MoDOT talks about the bridge, you'd think it's way out in farm country with the cows and chickens--rather than within spittin' distance of the highest concentration of households without a car ("zero-car households") in the Kansas City area, which is just to the south of the bridge.To make it worse, the north side of the bridge isn't filled by miles of empty cornfields as MoDOT seems to think--but is instead an industrial area with one of highest concentrations of jobs and industry in the region. The Paseo Industrial District is completely cut off from nearby low-income neighborhoods by the freeway and railroad yard on one side and the river on the other.Throw in another major industrial area just to the south of the bridge (the East Bottoms), the Isle of Capri Casino adjacent bridge on the south side, and the Port Authority's planned mixed-use urban village just to the southwest of the bridge, and you're looking at thousands of jobs and residences within easy walking distance of each end of the bridge.For MoDOT, major urban area = "Nowhere to go"I have personally given MoDOT staff, including Kidwell and Benefield quoted in this article, detailed presentations showing exactly where, how, and why people would use the Paseo bike/ped path to access jobs on the north side of the river and why no other bridge can possibly replace the connections that the Paseo Bridge makes.So, frankly, to have MoDOT's Jennifer Benefield say, repeatedly, to the press, "There would be nowhere to go once you got off the bridge" is nothing short of infuriating.I have personally shown Benefield where bicyclists and pedestrians would go, once off the bridge.And I would be more than happy to show her again.In fact, I've got a tandem with an empty back seat and I'll make the offer right now: I would be more than happy to take Benefield and Kidwell on a ride and show them exactly how people can--and do--access jobs, work, and housing easily and safely from either end of the Paseo Bridge on foot and on bicycle.What they can't do now is cross the river safely.In MoDOT-land, people can't walk or bicycle on public roadsThe problem is that MoDOT is some sort of a state of denial, where they cannot comprehend that people can walk along roads that don't have officially designated sidewalks and can bicycle on roads that are not officially designated bicycle routes.In fact, people do walk and bicycle extensively in the neighborhoods and industrial areas in either side of the bridge.And they depend on walking, bicycling, and transit to reach jobs, shopping, and other necessities.But--they can't walk or bicycle across water.Below are some of the diagrams and aerial photos we have prepared for MoDOT, and shown to Benefield and Kidwell, that show the barriers to walking and bicycling in this area and how the Paseo bike/ped path would make connections that cannot be made any other way.Even a small donation to the Put People on Paseo campaign can help bring MoDOT back to reality.Potential Paseo Connections169 is the Broadway Bridge; 9 is the Heart of America (HOA) Bridge; I-29 is the Paseo Bridge.These are parts of the central area of the Kansas City metro area that are potentially very well connected via a bicycle/pedestrian path on the Paseo Bridge.Although the bike/ped connection would serve the entire metropolitan area, which currently has no good, safe way to cross the Missouri River on bicycle or on foot, even just the immediate connection completely justifies the project: On the north side of the river is the Paseo Industrial District, which employs thousands of workers, and the immediate south side is the Isle of Capri Casino, the Port Authority's planned multi-use development that will house thousands of people, and the Columbus Park neighborhood, which already houses thousands of people.The highest concentration of households without a car ("zero-car households") in the Kansas City area is just to the south of the Missouri river. Among the highest concentrations of jobs and industry are downtown and just to the north of the river.Re-Connecting Dis-Connected IslandsNote the number of rooftops just to either side of the river in this aerial photo.Now contrast this with the statement by MoDOT's Jennifer Benefield, "There would be nowhere to go once you got off the bridge."This map shows the potential bicycle/pedestrian connections that can be made if a bicycle/pedestrian connection is provided along the Paseo corridor over the Missouri River ONLY (ie, not over the railroad yard that separates the Paseo Industrial District from the rest of North Kansas City).The black lines are schematic, not actual paths. They show which of the different colored "islands" would be connected by the proposed links.With no links at all along the Paseo corridor t
he "islands" all remain completely disconnected for bicyclists & pedestrians.That is why it is important for bicycle/pedestrian access to be considered in all transportation projects, even freeway projects. Bicyclists and pedestrians need access to the same destinations motorists reach via the freeway, and for the same reasons.In the case of the Paseo corridor, there are certain areas, notably the Paseo Industrial District, that motor vehicles access almost exclusively via the freeway.Say Moo . . . This is what MoDOT imagines the area around the Paseo Bridge looks like--nothing but cow fields in every direction.Compare the amount of rooftops visible in this aerial photo (from a location in rural Missouri) with the actual Paseo Bridge location above.That's the difference between "Nowhere to go" and "Thousands of places to go."Then help bring MoDOT back to reality--go make a donation, even just a small one, to the Put People On Paseo campaign.

Area bicyclist calls for safe river crossings in Kansas City area
Sat, 10/20/2007 - 9:06pm
Kansas City area bicyclist Sarah Belanus wrote:The recent death of a pedestrian has once again brought to the forefront the issue of safe bicycle and pedestrian access to Kansas City’s river bridges.The downtown renewal is outfitting our beautiful city with a vibrant, livable and healthy new downtown space. People are snapping up condos and lofts, and looking for ways to enjoy living without having to use a car.Did you know that our heritage as a Missouri Riverfront city is actually a hindrance to those who wish to live downtown?There are no pedestrian walkways or sidewalks to get across any of our bridges. Anyone who has driven across the Broadway Bridge has seen people walking down the middle “catwalk,” little more than a 2-foot-wide section of curb between four lanes of speeding traffic.When will MoDOT step up and commit to keeping those who walk and bike downtown safe?Read the rest of Sarah's letter, and community responses to it, here.Send a message to MoDOT asking for better bike/ped access across the Missouri River here.

MoBikeFed Press Release: PEDESTRIAN DEATH ON BROADWAY BRIDGE HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR SAFE RIVER CROSSINGS
Thu, 10/11/2007 - 7:05am
PRESS RELEASE12 October 2007Contact information:Dr. Brent HughExecutive DirectorMissouri Bicycle Federation876-695-6736director@MoBikeFed.orgPEDESTRIAN DEATH ON BROADWAY BRIDGE HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR SAFE RIVER CROSSINGSThe death of a pedestrian early Wednesday, apparently attempting to cross the Broadway Bridge near downtown Kansas City, has brought to the fore the issue of safe bicycle and pedestrian access to Kansas City's river bridges."It's shameful that as a metropolitan area we cannot provide safe access across these bridges for those who depend on walking and bicycling for basic transportation," says Missouri Bicycle Federation Executive Director Brent Hugh."The Broadway Bridge is an incredibly hostile and dangerous environment for pedestrians," says Hugh.  "But a steady stream of pedestrians crosses it every day--because it is the only way they have to get from home to work.""Walking, bicycling, and transit aren't optional," says Hugh.  "They are basic transportation."According to census data, 13% of households in KCMO do not own an automobile.  In Missouri, 13% of adults--and over 25% of the general population--are not licensed to drive.Community advocates have been pushing MoDOT, which controls all Missouri River bridges in the region, to include a bicycle/pedestrian path on the new Paseo Bridge and to retrofit the existing Heart of America, Paseo, Broadway, and other existing bridges."At this point, we have over 2300 public comments in support of safe bike/ped river crossings, a unanimous vote of the KCMO city council, and strong direction from the regional planning organization," says Hugh. "All of these are asking MoDOT to come up with a realistic plan to provide safe bicycle and pedestrian access across the river in the heart of the metro area.""MoDOT should be embarrassed that after all that community support, they cannot come up with anything more than weak promises, unfunded ideas, vague possibilities, and long, drawn-out timelines to solve this serious problem.""MoDOT should make a definite promise to include a bike/ped path on the Paseo Bridge and to retrofit the Heart of America Bridge for safe bike/ped use within one year.  Then let's see a timeline and a realistic plan to tackle the rest of the bridges. People's lives are at stake here.""MoDOT leadership in District 4 has a long history of giving a cold shoulder to any type of transportation other than single-occupant automobile," says Hugh.  "Quite frankly, if MoDOT District 4 leadership cannot change its attitude to adapt to the changing transportation needs of our community, then we as a community should be asking for new MoDOT leaders who can."---The Missouri Bicycle Federation, founded in 1994, represents the interests of walkers, runners, trail users, and the more than 2 million Missourians who bicycle regularly.

Pedestrian death today underlines need for safe river crossings
Tue, 10/09/2007 - 6:59pm
A terrible  event happened this morning in Kansas City, that underlines the need for SAFE bicycle and pedestrian river crossings--something MoBikeFed works for across the state, but in cooperation with local advocacy groups has specifically been working for in the KC area for the past couple of years.There has never been a better time contact MoDOT and express your support for good, safe, appropriate accommodations for those who need to walk and bicycle across bridges.You can do it in two minutes here.A pedestrian was killed this morning, apparently crossing the Broadway Bridge near downtown Kansas City.As anyone who has seen the Broadway Bridge can tell you, it is as hostile to pedestrian traffic as a bridge could possible be.But because it serves destinations no other bridge serves, it has a steady stream of pedestrian traffic across it all day long.A "debate" still going on among transportation "professionals" about whether our KC area river bridges need to safely accommodate bicycling and walking. They are weighing the "pros" and the "cons".Folks, there are no pros or cons here. There are only people injured and killed due to short-sighted transportation decisions.And common sense about what we need to do NOW to solve that problem.So there never would be a better time to let District 4 Chief Engineer Elizabeth Wright and MoDOT Director Pete Rahn know how you feel about this issue:http://mobikefed.org/KCRiverCrossingsOr just email Pete.Rahn@modot.mo.gov - elizabeth.wright@modot.mo.gov - brian.kidwell@modot.mo.govBetween now & Nov 14th MoDOT will make the decision about whether bike/ped will be included on the Paseo Bridge, and whether the Heart of America will get its bike/ped retrofit NOW or wait until 2011 or 2012.Now is the time to speak up, loud and clear, and say that the situation for those of us who walk and bicycle on the Kansas City river bridges is simply intolerable.Letters to the editor would be welcome: letters@kcstar.com - feedback@pitch.com - or submit to your own local media outlet.If you haven't seen bad the Broadway Bridge is for pedestrians, you can how it looks and how it is used by a steady trickle of pedestrians here (first 20 seconds of video).KCStar story:Pedestrian accident closes northbound lanes of Broadway BridgeThe northbound lanes of U.S. 169 over the Broadway Bridge were shut down this morning following an accident that killed a pedestrian.The accident happened before 6 a.m.Police shut down a long stretch of 169 from 5th Street and Broadway to Missouri 9 Highway. It was reopened about 7 a.m.The wreck remains under investigation.

Kansas City Missouri River crossings evaluated for bike/ped friendliness
Fri, 08/19/2005 - 1:12am
An evaluation of Kansas City area Missouri River bridges by MoBikeFed Executive Director Brent Hugh comes to this stark conclusion:No facility currently serves the "average" pedestrian or bicyclist--children, families, inexperienced bicyclists, trail users, or those with disabilities. The Heart of American Bridge accommodates very experienced on-road bicyclists in the northbound direction, but the southbound direction has no accommodation and is very, very difficult.The Chouteau Bridge itself is very bicycle friendly but the streets accessing the bridge and extremely busy and unfriendly for walking or bicycling.No bridge in the entire metro area even pretends to accommodate pedestrians.The evaluation includes a description and detailed photographs of most Missouri River bridges in the area that are open to bicyclists:# Broadway Bridge (Hwy 169)# ASB Bridge (railroad)# Heart of America Bridge (Hwy 9)# Paseo Bridge (I-29/I-35)# Chouteau Trafficway Bridge  With no current Missouri River bridge in the area offering bicycle/pedestrian access, it becomes more imperative that the Paseo Bridge project, currently in the planning stages, accommodate bicycle and pedestrian access in some fashion.MoDOT needs to hear from bicyclists from across the state who support a safe river crossing in the Kansas City area.Those wishing to weigh in with MoDOT can do so in less than one minute using the online form provided by the Greater Kansas City Bicycle Federation.
