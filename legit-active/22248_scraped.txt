GADJITSTell Yourself Lyrics
What do you tell yourself at night
to make you feel better?
So you know your not a sellout
and you know your not a quitter.
What kind of stories do you tell yourself
to make it feel allright?
What do you tell yourself, tell yourself
at night?
Well you say hey me.
I know its been a bad day
and my girlfriend ran off with my credit cards
and had a hay day.
Well you say hey me
I know that its not payday
but if I don't spend some money soon
I surely will go hungry.
Well you say hey me .
Am I a motivation?
Am I such a shining star?
Am I such an inspiration?
Well you say hey me.
Am I a motivation?
Am I such a shining star?
Am I such an inspiration?
What do you tell yourself at night
to make you feel better?
So you know your not a sellout
and you know your not a quitter.
What kind of stories do you tell yourself
to make it feel allright?
What do you tell yourself, tell yourself
at night?
Well you say hey me.
I know its been a bad day
and my girlfriend ran off with my credit cards
and had a hay day.
Well you say hey me.
I know that its not payday
but if I don't spend some money soon
I surely will go hungry.
Well you say hey me.
Am I a motivation?
Am I such a shining star?
Am I such an inspiration?
Well you say hey me.
Am I a motivation?
Am I such a shining star?
Am I such an inspiration?
What do you tell yourself at night
to make you feel better?
So you know your not a sellout
and you know your not a quitter.
What kind of stories do you tell yourself
to make it feel allright?
What do you tell yourself, tell yourself
at night?
What do you tell yourself at night
to make you feel better?
So you know your not a sellout
and you know your not a quitter.
What kind of stories do you tell yourself
to make it feel allright?
What do you tell yourself, tell yourself
at night?
