I remember also seeing Ruta Lee on whatever TV game show involved playing
charades.  She was hilarious as I recall.  She also played a double role in
Mayberry like Gavin McLeod: that "college kid" reporter for the unscrupulous
businessman as well as the Hollywood starlet, living in the lovely apartment
with a fabulous view.
