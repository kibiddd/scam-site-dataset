HBO Films presents another historical fictional biopic
Directed by Tim Fywell this is about Norma Jean & Marilyn Monroe played by Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino
Norma Jean had a religious upbringing growing up and her grandma was lost in her own mind as well as her mother so she dreamed about not having any shame wanting to break away from her strict father's upbringing
She always dreamed of making it in Hollywood but being promiscuous seemed to be the only way up
Plus her aunt sent her away to be rehabilitated at a young age
Her whole life she was mistreated by various men therefore she used her body as a tool as well as a weapon to make it by
Norma went through so many physical transformations just to appeal to the Hollywood executives
She then transforms into Marilyn Monroe, one of the biggest sex symbol actresses of the time but struggled with pill addiction, nervous ticks, and love affairs
In a way she "kills" her former self to be better but has psychological issues too
Marilyn sadly died at the age of 35 from drug overdose back in 1962
Still this movie highlighted the need for the #metoo movement
It has taken on a new dimension in the context of society's current reckoning with serial sexual abusers
Two fine actresses carry the parts, there's some good historical wardrobe aesthetics although some of the acting is a bit soapy and there's more emphasis on the romance angle
But Judd is superb and Sorvino shines both talking to each other subconsciously
This is a film that explores, however clumsily, the horrors of the very system that enabled and protected their abuser is rather extraordinary
These stories – as well as those of many women who have bravely spoken out against their abusers recently  – would likely resonate with Marilyn Monroe, who rose to fame in an era when these repulsive behaviors were considered normal
A good biopic despite it being very lengthy

Surreal in places and much darker than My week with Marilyn.  It is a stroke of genius having Ashley Judd as Norma Jean and once she goes under the knife and becomes Marilyn Mira Sorvino takes over but Norma Jean remains in a ghostly presence haunting Marilyn and pushing her further and further into darker places of fame.  This is a really great version of the Marilyn Monroe story.  Sexy, Nasty, Twisted, Funny and heart braking.

It's a very sad true story, although I'm not sure how accurate it is. Mira Sorvino was great.
