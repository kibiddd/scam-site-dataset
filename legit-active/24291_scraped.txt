At his bedside were his longtime soulmate and travel companion Roanna Law and his oldest brother and regular riding companion Don. Grant was a double kidney transplant recipient, who worked for many years as a medical equipment technician specializing in dialysis equipment after graduating from Seneca College. Grant was very proud of his extensive collection of motorcycles and scooters, which he loved to ride, work on and talk about. It was always a surprise which motorcycle he would arrive on and was enjoying that particular day. Grant was kind, loving and thoughtful and exhibited a quiet courage and determination in life that was exemplary, not to be outdone by his wry sense of humour, that was with him until the very end. Grant is survived by his mother Dora, his brothers Don, Graham, Greg and Glenn. He was predeceased by his father Frank, and his two older sisters Marilyn and Linda. Friends will be received at the HERITAGE FUNERAL CENTRE, 50 Overlea Blvd., 416-423-1000, on Friday from 5-9 p.m. A Funeral Service will be held in the funeral home chapel on Saturday, July 24th at 12 noon. Interment at York Cemetery. Please join Grant for his last ride (motorcycles and scooters are welcome). Donations to The James Fund, a cancer research charity, will be happily accepted in lieu of flowers.
