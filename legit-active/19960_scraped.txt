Okay, I'm interested in finding out the best hot dog you ever had. Brand name, where you got it, how it was served up.
Oughta be an interesting thread, if it hasn't been done before.
I'll start out. Pat's Hot Dogs on Sheridan Drive in Buffalo. They use(d) Sahlen's hot dogs, and were cooked over charcoal. No longer in business. I understand Ted's is big up there, but I haven't been back since 1970.
Next.....

"The Original" in Pittsburgh, Pa. East End. I do not know details but dogs are grilled perfectly and they have every condiment I know of.

The pushcart out in front of NJIT circa 1980.....steamed in "dishwater", served with sauerkraut and the red onion sauce that only NJ/NY pushcarts can make effectively.....
2 for a buck.....
Recently, it would have to be the dogs at Askin's Creek Oasis in Avon, NC.....made on one of those convenience store roller things, but the dogs themselves were great, and they had fresh chopped onions, Carolina hot sauce, and a pot of chili at the condiment stand for toppings.....I think I eat at least 10 of them during my two weeks down there every year......

No love for Nathans on Coney Island?  I had my first there, almost 20 years ago (Damn    ) when I was dating a girl who lived in Sheapshead Bay.  For a guy who lived in the 'Burbs of Jersey, there was nothing like the excitment of double parking with everyone else, grabbing a couple and some fries with a chick in high heels even higher hair, and standing there in a crowd on the boardwalk at midnight.
Funny...I'm told there is also a great place for Dogs on Monmouth Street in Red Bank.  Despite living there for 15 years, and driving past the place countless times, I've never been inside.

Had to be the Wiener's Circle, in Chicago... spicy chardog with everything and cheese fries. Must be ten years ago, and I think I'm still belching the dog.    Ah, but it was gooooood.

Sounds like a copy cat of Jimmy Buff's......and while I would "kill" for one of those right about now, I can't consider that a traditional hot dog (not that there's anything wrong with that.....)
Sal...Rutt's Hut......    .....used to live 2 miles from the place way back when, and it was frequently a late night (albeit drunken     ) stop.....

The Windmill on Ocean Ave in Long Branch NJ has my favorite 1/4 lb griddle franks ever. A little pricey but well worth it. Their deep fried breaded mushrooms are great too
Don't even think of attempting to get something there at bar closing time (not that I didn't used to do it all the time        ), the line is out the door.
(the eye candy can be worth the wait though)
They starting franchising the place a few years ago so there are now multiple locations, I know of another one on the north side of Long Branch, another in Belmar and one in Freehold.  They also started selling the dogs in the supermarket.  We used to buy Schickhaus but now the only dogs that come into my house are Windmill dogs
FYI, Another great place, Max's serves up 1/4 lb Schickhaus franks (made under license by Grote & Weigle). The Windmill uses a beef and pork frank from Sabrett made special for them which is a little less spicy than their regular all beef dog and seems to have a higher quality casing, has a great crunch hot off the griddle.
The "Who's got the better dog - Max's vs. Windmill" has been a staple argument in my area ever since I can remember with the popular opinion going around 50/50.
Other shore places that carry the "Max's style" Schickhaus/Grote & Weigle griddle frank, usually packaged as "Boardwark Griddle Franks" are Martell's and also Jenkinson's in Point Pleasant.
Rutt's Hut!      It's been years since I thought of that place. When we first started dating, my wife was going to Montclair State. I have some hazy memories of incredible indigestion brought on by copious amounts of beer combined with Rutt's hut dogs and/or Rays pizza.

Any dirty water dog from a pushcart that sports the Sabrett name. Mustard and BBQ'd onions.
An Italian dog from Greasy Charlies in Kenilworth
Locally Dietz and Watson.  Steamed in beer at home.

Not a copy cat at all.....started back 30+ years ago along the time Jimmy Buffs was in the arly years as well. And he didn't say "traditional"...he just said "best"!

Did you know that Texas Weiners were created in Paterson by a couple of Greeks running Falls View Restaurant??? I know, you don't think dogs drenched in chili is a Greek food. I discovered those dogs when I was about 15. Danm!! They now have a few Falls Views in NJ and own the Hot Grill in Clifton too. I also like Goffle Grill, where I've seen the CEO of a mega-pharmaceutical company, downing Texas weiners.
Rut's is great for the classic dog, as is the Windmill.
My absolute favorite is Thuman's 5 lb pack grilled at home until the skin splits, rich brown mustard, vidalia relish, toasted bun. Yum!!

Ah, The Hot Grill.....that brings back some memories.....when I played freshman baseball for Columbus Junior High, the Hot Grill was right across the street from where we played our home games (Nash Park).....and was always the place to celebrate our victory (okay, we only lost one game that year, and that was "away").
It was also the place that as underage youngsters getting drunk (and indulging in "other" things) on Friday and Saturday night, we would crash to get some munchies......
Gravy on the fries.......
