Powerful NHL FigureMike Murphy was a talented NHL player
who enjoyed a long and productive playing career. Yet Murphy's lasting
legacy in hockey is all about what he has done since he moved into the
executive ranks. After working as an NHL coach, Murphy took a job with
the league and eventually rose to the position of Senior Vice President
of Hockey Operations. Over the years, in his role at the league office
in Toronto, he has had a huge impact on rules changes as well as
disciplinary decisions. He had been part of key rulings related to the
video review of goals and the length of major player suspensions. In its
2002 list of the 100 People of Power and Influence,
The Hockey News first
ranked Murphy at No. 21, and he was a fixture on the publication's list
for many years.
