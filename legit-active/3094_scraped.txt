The Jonestown Banks
by John Judge
August 1982
The assets of Jim Jones’ People’s Temple have yet to be
fully accounted, but early research in the press and by
independent investigators put the total between $26 million
and $2 billion. Following the money leads down a twisted
trail of international banks, dummy fronts, real estate
investments and conflicting government reports. Various
sources estimate a total of at least $17-$20 million in
foreign investments, and property worth $2.5 million that
passed through deed, sale and ownership from 1976 to 1979.
Some $12 million dollars was deposited in mysterious
accounts in Panama.  During the recent scandal involving
the Vatican Bank, Bank Ambrosiana and deceased Italian
financier Roberto Calvi, information surfaced indicating
that some of the siphoned millions went to Panamanian
banks. Time magazine noted in a July 26 issue this
year that Archbishop Paul Marcinkus of the Vatican Bank
set up twelve ghost companies in Panama for the movement of
funds.  A short five days later, on July 31, 1982, the New
York Times carried an AP wire story that the President of
Panama was resigning, and all high officials were soon to
be replaced there. A review of the holdings known to the
public in the Jonestown affair may reveal to serious
researchers what connections exist between the financial
operations.

*These were the assets revealed shortly after the
massacre.  Jones’ personal account at Bank of America was
reported to have dwindled from “hundreds of thousands,” the
Grenada account may have been part of an initial reported
investment of $200,000 in 1977 to pave the way for a colony
there. The contents of the Zurich bank’s safe deposit box
may have been as much as $2,000,000 by some reports, but
later claims that the Swiss accounts were “emptied” into
Panamanian banks don’t gibe with these figures for Union
Bank of Switzerland accounts.  Naturally, the Redwood
Valley “Treasure Chest” of $11 million may not be an
addition to the later totals, but it should be considered
in context. The Bank of Nova Scotia account was reportedly
“closed out” and may or may not have become the same bank’s
account in the Bahamas. But it certainly shrank in size.
Despite the possibility of some overlap, these totals do
not match the final tally of $10,000,000 given out by court
receiver Fabian.
Terri Buford, one of Jones’ top lieutenants, was often
responsible for setting up the international accounts. For
instance, both she and Debbie Layton Blakey were reported
to have carried out a “mysterious financial mission” from
Panama to London, where they were alleged to have “studied
Socialist and Communist banks,” then on to France and
Switzerland. Terri repeatedly instructed the bank clerk in
Switzerland not to “discuss anything” during their visit,
but he did mention a $2,000,000 account in passing, perhaps
the one in the safe deposit box (San Francisco Examiner,
1/9/79). Accounts were secured in many names besides Jones’
and People’s Temple. Terri Buford, Carolyn Layton, Maria
Katsaris and others from Jones’ entourage were used. In
addition, dummy organizations like Bridget, S.A.,
Angelique, and others, disguised the accounts. Terri Buford
reportedly gave the Grand Jury investigators records of
deposits in Panamanian banks totalling $7.5 million, while
press reports suggested that more money was residing in
Swiss and Guyanese banks.  Following the massacre, Buford
and Mark Lane traveled in Europe, leading to speculation
that they had been instrumental in removing money from the
Swiss accounts, a charge (LAT, 1/20/79) Lane was to
vehemently deny in print. Lane was simultaneously the
attorney for People’s Temple and accused assassin James
Earl Ray. Lane and Buford also lived with and cared for a
key witness in the Ray case, Grace Walden Stevens.
According to some reports in the New York Times (2/4/79),
Jones offered Mark Lane money to help free James Earl Ray.
Later stories suggest that Buford and Lane were in
collusion to bring Grace Stevens into Jonestown under an
illegal passport (NYT, 12/8/79).
Buford’s Panama visit may have been connected to a “few
banking trips to Caracas, Panama City and the San Francisco
suburb of Belmont” (Miami Herald, 3/27/79) made by Jones’
confidant, Maria Katsaris, in 1978. Clearly, three numbered
accounts were in place there by 1978. Court-appointed
receiver Fabian finally admits in November of 1979 that
there were two accounts. One in the name of Annie McGowan
at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Panama, a follower of
Jones who died in the carnage. The two accounts described
there by the San Francisco Examiner could both meet
the description in terms of cash balance. They are,
respectively, accounts #121-00-191A and #121-00135A (see
chart above). In addition, Fabian
notes the existence of a $2,000,000 balance in the Swiss
Banking Corporation of Panama in the name of a “dummy front.”
This is account #3357 (see chart
above) (LAT, 11/18/79).
Michael Prokes and Tim Carter, two of the camp guards
who survived, claim that Maria Katsaris instructed them to
take a chest with $500,000 to the Soviet Embassy. On their
return to the United States, they claimed contact with
Soviet Embassy officials in Guyana. They said they knew
Valerly Koval (reportedly a Major in the KGB and a top
operative in Latin America), and Feodor Timofeyev (a KGB
Deputy, allegedly). Timofeyev’s name appeared on letters
addressed to the Soviets instructing them on access to $7
million in a Panamanian account at the Union Bank of
Switzerland (San Francisco Chronicle, 1/21/79). This
story is most likely an elaborate ruse to cover the real
money flow, or an excessive trap to lure Soviet “involvement”
with Jones’ camp after the massacre. Jones was not in any
way disposed to give money to the Soviet Union.  But let’s
take a closer look at the real development of the Panama
money cache.
In January, 1979, the Department of Justice released its
intention to bring a $4.2 million suit against People’s
Temple funds to recover the cost of body removal by the
U.S. military. Defendants named at that point included the
Asociacion Religiosa Pro San Pedro, S.A. of Panama. The
following day, the presiding magistrate, Judge Brown, sent
a “lawyer to Panama,” and the suit claimed that the “Panama
affiliate” was “organized to handle the assets of People’s
Temple” (Oakland Times, 1/23/79).  The San Francisco
Chronicle had estimated a financial empire of at least $26
million (SFC 1/9/79), but when Judge Brown moved to
dissolve the People’s Temple on January 24, State Attorney
General Appalas placed the total much lower. “Contrary to
previous press reports, Appalas said, total Temple assets
approached only $12 million and were located in Grenada,
Venezuela, the Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad,” said the San
Francisco Chronicle (1/24/79). No mention of Panama. The
same day, Guyanese official Kit Nascimento attempted to
absolve Guyanese government officials, including President
Burnham’s wife, of any wrongdoing in the removal of a
reported half million dollars by plane from the Jonestown
site, claiming it was all deposited in the Bank of Guyana
in Georgetown. It is not clear how this claim, which
involves an account totaling $700,000 relates to the
reported money in Guyana after the deaths (see
chart above) (Washington
Post, 1/24/79). A few days later, Jim Jones’ mother-in-law,
Charlotte Baldwin in Richmond, Indiana, denied that he left a
large estate, and recounted his daughter Suzanne’s claim that
there was only property and “$17,000 in a Nassau account,”
presumably not a reference to the Bank of Nova Scotia
deposit (WP, 1/29/79).
Not until a Newsweek story on March 12, months later,
did Robert Fabian confirm that the Temple had a safe
deposit box in Switzerland, and bank accounts in “Panama
and Guyana.” However, his claim at that point was that the
three sources together could account for only an additional
$6 million. The following day, in Berne, Switzerland, the
Swiss government blocked access to funds and information on
the Swiss accounts under a 1973 U.S.-Swiss Legal Assistance
Treaty. They were only willing to give further information
if the FBI could prove the funds were gotten by criminal
means. U.S. officials were still estimating the Swiss
accounts topped $10 million (WP, 3/13/79). The
following day, March 14, Michael Prokes held a press
conference, revealed the phony tapes that suggested the
Jonestown suicides were not coerced, then shot himself in
the head. Finally, in August, conflicting stories began to
emerge from Switzerland. An official announcement of August 3
established that three bank accounts had been held since
1976, and that money was suddenly transferred to the U.S. and
to Panama around the time of the killings. The statement also
seemed to involve the release of $2 million and the papers
from the safe deposit box to U.S. authorities. These
authorities were now saying that assets totalled more than
$10 million, “most” in Panama City branches of Swiss Bank
Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland. No reason was
given for the transfer and names of the depositors and exact
dates were not released. Other reports and rumors persisted:
Jones had ordered $7 million sent to the Soviet Union in
December, 1978. Swiss accounts numbered from six to a dozen.
Money was held in dummy fronts in Guyana. Some even suggested
funds were being sent to the PLO. (SFC 8/3/79). Another
story suggested that the amount suddenly shifted to Panama
had been $2,000,000, and Justice Department officials were
surprised and skeptical that money had come into the
U.S. without their knowledge (WP 8/3/79).
Suddenly, court-appointed receiver Fabian announced in
October that he had “found” $7.2 million in Panama. “We’ve
gotten word from Panama that there’s $5.2 million in one
bank and another $2 million in another.” However, Fabian
said this was not new money, and total assets were still in
the $10 million range, because “part of the money in
Panama” was transferred there in 1978 from Swiss banks
whose accounts were now “empty.”
How does this story match the rest of the evidence about
the Swiss and Panamanian accounts?  Does it belie the
Swiss government claims, the U.S. authorities, or Mark
Lane? Fabian also claimed that there was another $3,000,000
in Guyana, but said we were unlikely to ever see it in the
U.S. due to Guyanese government claims. The only claim at
that point was Nasciemento’s plea that the money taken from
the site was held in anticipation of U.S. claims, and in
good faith. Another $200,000 was located in the Caribbean
banks, and $1.7 billion was outstanding in claims, said
Fabian (WP 10/6/82). The government claims held steady from
this point on.  Ten million total, $3 million in Guyana and
$7 million in Panama (SFC, 11/17/79), usually split into
two accounts of $5.2 million and $2 million (SFC 10/26/82)
coming by way of Switzerland.  Charles Touchette, a Temple
officer, was to claim hidden accounts totaling $66 million,
but Fabian scoffed at it (SFC 11/17/79). What, then had
become of the additional $5 million account in Panama, and
the mysterious Asociacion Religiosa Pro San Pedro, S.A.
(referred to later as “Asociacion Pro Religiosa do San
Pedro”)? Was it the “dummy front” for Jones, or for other
interests? Was it one of the operations set up by Robert
Calvi to hide Vatican investments?
Fabian dissolved the assets. Of the Asociacion he said,
“We’ll have to dissolve that one and get it in the name of
People’s Temple, the California Corporation” (SFC,
11/17/79). He managed to sell the church building in San
Francisco to a Kraft Company employee, Ho Deuk Bae, for
$300,000, who in turn said he would establish there the
Korean Central Christian Church and the Korean Presbyterian
Evangelical Reformed Church, reportedly not connected to
the vast Unification Church of Rev. Moon. (OT, 3/15/79).
At one point, he threatened to sell the Albatross, the
400-ton shipping vessel out on a supply run to Trinidad
when the murders came down. Top Jones aide, Phillip Blakey
made a reported “last call” to his father-in-law,
Dr. Lawrence Layton, from Panama. About ten followers
stayed on the boat, setting up a community in Trinidad at
first, while one Nigel Slingger, a Grenada businessman and
insurance broker for Jonestown, repaired the vessel. Charles
Touchette set up an open house in Grenada for Temple members,
and Paul McCann, Phillip Blakey, Steven Jones (son), and
others continued to live together.  McCann indicated on
KPIX-TV that they wanted to set up a shipping company to
“finance the continued works of the original Temple.” That
financing, and those works, continue to elude
scrutiny. There was no later record of the sale of the
Albatross. The Jonestown accounts, as they were, have been
divided. But the reality of the horror, like the money that
backed it up, continues to flow in unseen channels.
The unanswered question remains. Was the Jonestown
empire built with the same dirty money that came from the
Banco Ambrosiano, the Nugan-Hand Bank and other
international conduits of cash for the men who trade in
narcotics, espionage, human flesh and death?
