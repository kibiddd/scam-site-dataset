USS Hoga (YT-146) Yard Tug Model
Historically significant
custom made tugboat models such as this USS Hoga YT-146, a humble
yard tug that gave a gallant effort saving lifes and extinguishing
fires on December 7, 1941. Hoga was only six months in service
when Pearl Harbor was attacked. She managed to get underway within
ten minutes of the first hit on Pearl Harbor, the United States
entry into WWII. Saving anything and anyone they could along
Battleship Row. All men aboard bravely battled the fires of war
during that fateful time for 48 hours straight.
Shown here proudly in her
Pearl Harbor configuration, before the battle began, in 1/50th

oils with brass engraved nameplate.
