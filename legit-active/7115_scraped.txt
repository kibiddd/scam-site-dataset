Hirsch Panorama, taken May 2003
from the West, looking East
Created by Jewish Settlers
as a primarily Jewish Colony,
supported by a donation in 1890 from theBaron Maurice de Hirsch Institute,
with the assistance of
the Jewish Colonization Association.
It is named after it's benefactor,
Baron Maurice Hirsch
First , oldest and only Jewish colony
directly organized and established in Canada by
the Jewish Colonization Association.
Each family was given a $500.00 loan
repayable at 4% interest.
During the 1930's
most of the
Jewish Families
left the area, and moved to Winnipeg.
It is ironic, that today
this
is very productive land,
for Grain, and also for Oil production
from the 1960's until today.
Hirsch History is
being collected
by a former resident,
Gail Skikevitch
