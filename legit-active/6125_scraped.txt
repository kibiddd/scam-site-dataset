Live reviews
This is one of the longest band names I have ever had to write or type but here goes: Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra (definitely a copy and paste kind of job). They are a band that has endured various name changes of their career to respect the line-up changes.
Their instrumentation is so interesting with an electric guitar, a couple of violins a bass guitar and drums. When they play live, there is of course a little bit of an edge to their sound, with drums being hit harder than in the recording studio and guitars being turned up a little louder, which makes their sound a lot bigger than what patrons tonight are used to, but they soak up the atmosphere that is orchestrated by this hipster band that sounds so interesting an large when it’s combined with the strings at the front. It pleases the crowd hugely when they launch into some of their biggest songs such as “Austerity Blues” and “What We Loved Was Not Enough”, boasting some extended versions.
