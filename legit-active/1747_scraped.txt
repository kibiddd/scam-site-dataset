General Information
Specialty License Plates
Florida offers over 100 different specialty license plates for various organizations in support of the causes they represent.  The money raised from the sale of these license plates goes directly to the organization.  Since the inception of specialty license plate millions of dollars have been raised for the organizations.
New specialty license plates were authorized during the 2020 legislative session, and the required pre-sale process for these plates began October 16, 2020. See current pre-sale data here.
Specialty License Plate Gift Certificate Program
The Department has authorized the issuance of specialty license plate gift certificates.  The program allows anyone to purchase a specialty license plate as a gift for a motor vehicle registrant.
This gift certificate program works much like any gift certificate.  Upon payment of the statutorily authorized annual use fee, a gift certificate may be purchased at any authorized motor vehicle office (e.g., state motor vehicle office, local tax collector office or license plate tag agency) for any of the specialty license plates currently available in Florida.  At the time of purchase, a receipt will be provided, and a credit will be issued in the name of the gift recipient, which can then be redeemed by the recipient at the time the specialty license plate is purchased.  The gift certificate does not have to be purchased and redeemed at the same office.  The gift certificate is not required to be presented to redeem the credit, just proper identification (i.e. Florida driver’s license or ID card).  Once the gift certificate is purchased, the money is given to the sponsoring plate entity as specified by Florida Statutes.  Therefore, refunds are not available for gift certificates.
We believe that specialty license plates will make great gifts, and that this program will provide a great opportunity to promote the many causes and organizations represented by the specialty license plates.  Remember that in Florida, most registrations are renewed on the birth date of the registrant, so these gift certificates can also be a great birthday gift.
Special Requirement License Plates
Special requirement plates are a subtype of specialty license plates. Special plates differ from specialty plates due to specific requirements that must be provided by the registrant prior to the purchase of any special requirement plate.
Military License Plates
Florida is honored to provide military license plates to individuals that have served our country.  All military plates except the Medal of Honor plates are available at a local motor vehicle service center. Requests to order Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, and World War II Veteran plates MUST be submitted to the Department for processing.
