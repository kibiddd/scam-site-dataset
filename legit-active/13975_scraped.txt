Key Issues at Ohio State
Information on Legislative and Executive Actions
Ohio State continues to monitor and review legislation and executive actions brought forth at all levels of
government. As a public institution, the university will comply with all local, state and federal laws and
regulations. At the same time, Ohio State is committed to maintaining an environment in which students,
faculty and staff have the resources needed to fully participate and succeed in teaching, learning, research
and patient care.

prevent the abuse.

Philosophy on Statements
To maintain the neutrality that assures academic freedom and freedom of speech and expression,
Ohio State refrains from taking institutional positions on matters that extend beyond the university.
When statements are issued, the university uses a framework to evaluate making institutional and leadership
statements to ensure decisions are made based on consistent factors.
