Bill MelendezAKA José Cuauhtemoc MeléndezBorn: 15-Nov-1916Birthplace: Hermosillo, Sonora, MexicoDied: 2-Sep-2008Location of death: Santa Monica, CA [1]Cause of death: unspecifiedRemains: CrematedGender: MaleReligion: Roman CatholicRace or Ethnicity: HispanicSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: Cartoonist, Film Director, Film/TV ProducerNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: A Charlie Brown ChristmasBill Melendez was a cartoonist, best known for his work on many Peanuts specials for TV. He started his career at the Disney studio in 1938, drawing for Fantasia, Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo, and numerous other early Disney films and shorts. After leaving Disney, Melendez went to Warner Brothers and helped draw classic shorts starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig. In his early years at Warner Bros, he was credited as "J. C. Melendez", because some anonymous executive felt that his real first and last names would be too "foreign-sounding".  He also worked at UPA studio, where he helped craft stylized animated shorts starring Madeline and Gerald McBoing-Boing.
He formed his own Bill Melendez Productions in 1964, and the company's first production was A Charlie Brown Christmas. It may be hard to imagine now, as Peanuts specials are holiday traditions, but when Melendez made the first Peanuts special with Charles Schulz and producer Lee Mendelson in 1965, the network hated it. Schultz, a devout Catholic, had insisted that the show's climax include a long reading of the Christmas story from the Biblical book of Luke -- highly unusual for prime time network TV. With no laugh track, voice work by real kids instead of adult actors, and a jazz score by Vince Guaraldi, A Charlie Brown Christmas was not what the network or sponsor had expected, and CBS executives wondered whether anyone would watch. The program, of course, drew huge ratings, and it has aired every Christmas since.
Peanuts quickly became the Melendez studio's mainstay, and more than 40 Peanuts specials have been made, including A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving and the wonderful religious allegory It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Among the lesser and less-often aired specials, birds and cats played football in You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown!, and the kids learned about leukemia in Why, Charlie Brown, Why?
Schulz, who died in 2000, reportedly requested that no further specials be made after his passing. Melendez, however, continued churning out Peanuts specials, claiming to take his inspiration from old Peanuts strips, although few reviewers would describe his later work as "inspired". His post-Schulz specials include such mediocrities as Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown and I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown.
Melendez provided the voice for Snoopy and Woodstock, and his studio has also made occasional "Cathy", "Babar the Elephant", and "Garfield" specials, and a few feature length theatrical "Peanuts" movies. Melendez shared an Oscar for the music in the 1969 film A Boy Called Charlie Brown. He was Emmy-nominated 18 times, and won five.[1] St. John's Hospital, Santa Monica, CA.
