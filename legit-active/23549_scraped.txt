WASHINGTON — Perhaps it was the heat. Perhaps it was the fatigue of running the bases. Pitching coach Dan Warthen does not know the root cause of starter Jon Niese’s four-pitch immolation today, but he knows why Niese suddenly faltered.“I thought he just ran out of gas,” Warthen said. He added, “All those pitches were bad pitches.”Those four pitches led to three doubles and two runs by the Wasgington Nationals in the sixth inning of a 3-2 defeat. The trouble appeared almost out of nowhere — Niese had cruised through the first five innings, striking out six Washington batters and filing up the zone with strikes.“It was one of those things where I felt a lot better than the end result was,” Niese said.His line was saved by reliever Ryota Igarashi, who stranded both runners he inherited from Niese. Otherwise, Niese’s ERA would have continued its upward surge. His performance fits a pattern.Five days ago, as Niese cruised through the first four innings again, Warthen watched him “lose focus” and allow five runs to Cincinnati. This time, the mini-blowup came when his team could ill afford to fall behind, considering their offensive woes.A mid-season slump is a bad harbinger for Niese. In 2010, his progress was stunted by ugly outings in August and September. Both Niese and Warthen blamed improper conditioning for the late-season swoon.This season, after a slow beginning, Niese made 10 starts in May and June with a 3.06 ERA. July has not been as successful. He entered today’s game with a 4.88 ERA this month. Warthen wanted to prevent Niese from further struggles.“You can’t just go up there,” Warthen said, “and think that this guy’s out because I have better stuff than him.”In the third inning, as the Mets staged a rally against Washington starter Jordan Zimmermann, Niese found himself at third with the bases loaded. There was one out as Angel Pagan flied to right.At first base, Daniel Murphy charged forward to try and draw a cut-off of the throw from outfielder Jayson Werth. Niese began to run home, then peeled back to the bag.First baseman Michael Morse intercepted the throw and Murphy was doubled off to end the inning.From the outside perspective, it appeared Murphy had goofed. But after the game, manager Terry Collins explained who was at fault.“We thought Jon was going to try to go home,” Collins said.Murphy’s intention was to have Morse cut off the throw. That way, at worst, he would be caught in a run-down which would grant Niese enough time to come home. Instead, nothing positive occurred.“It was my fault,” Niese said.For more Mets coverage, follow Andy McCullough on Twitter at twitter.com/Ledger_NYMetsAndy McCullough: amccullough@starledger.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
