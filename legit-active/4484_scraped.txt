Hmm, for Peter is it Atonement or just the Keira factor (I well remember the P&P review)

A very good film - though perhaps not quite as amazing as all the hype would suggest. The first hour of the film is absolutely awesome. But the middle seemed to lose its way and it seems, like The English Patient, that it will build to a catharsis at the end but never quite manages to pull that off.  The TV scene with Vanessa Redgrave is a bit too cold & clever and lacks the poignancy of the book. Still, the brilliance of the opening hour of this film proves that Joe Wright is a director to watch.

The problem with over-hyped films like this is that, even when they're good (as this one is), you end up feeling mildly disappointed. It's vain to talk of Oscars when the two leads are given so little to do - Keira Knightley is required only to be poised and glacial, while James McAvoy has a far less demanding role than he had in The Last King of Scotland. The standout performance is actually from Saoirse Ronan as the peeved, precocious child who wrecks her sister's romance, and there's a sense of dislocation when another actress takes her story on.
The plot of the film is simple, but the timeline jumps around annoyingly. Captions tell us it's "four years later", or "six months earlier" than that, and someone appears to be under the impression that Dunkirk took take place in 1939. There's a stunning sequence on Dunkirk beach, following McAvoy through the mayhem, from one vignette to another in what seems to be one take. But overall, the film feels strangely hollow, for all that it's well-acted and well-made. The literary conceit of the denouement reinforces this impression. Though there's tragedy in the story, I didn't really feel it because I never felt I knew the characters.

Atonement is one of my favourite books and I was so nervous to see what the film would be like.  I was delighted to see that the film captured the book beautifully.  The casting was fantastic.  Even Keira Knightley managed not to annoy me.  Lola was beautifully evil.
The war scenes were graphically unpleasant and James McAvoy was just brilliant as the tortured Robbie.
I wept through the second half of the film, which was consciously tearjerking.
The end was handled wonderfully, with the elderly Briony confessing the awful truth of the outcome of her actions.
It was a very good handling of a beautiful, tragic story.

It is notoriously difficult to adapt an accomplished book into a cinematic masterpiece but the makers of Pride and Prejudice have accomplished the miracle in an amazingly assured manner.
Ian McEwan's complex narrative is translated fluidly and poetically in a very measured tone by Christopher Hampton into a ravishingly gorgeous adaptation of the 2001 bestseller, but the final plaudits belong to Keira Knightley, who is stunningly elegant yet brittle like a porcelain doll in a portrayal which is likely to be compared to Vivien Leigh and Dietrich, yet James McAvoy reasserts his potential as the best British leading man as Robbie Turner in his best performance yet.
One magical day in 1935 Brionny commits a crime, which changes her life forever and that of her sister Cecilia and Robbie, the gamekeeper's son in their father's country house in rural England.
The movie moves from the idyllic English summer to the horrors of war at Dunkirk executed on a scale of epic proportions, to the near present in an authentic manner, which makes recent epics look like squeamish efforts. The evacuation sequence from Dunkirk is going to go down in cinema history as a truly magical moment.
Keira brings a dignity and sexuality to her character which is worthy of all the praises she can possibly garner and her portrayal will rank as one of the best ever in world cinema, she is mesmerisingly beautiful and performs with an elan that is worthy of Katherine Hepburn, McAvoy is equally stunning as his character springs vividly to life in an accomplished way worthy of British greats like Hopkins and Olivier.
The rest of the cast excel as well and a special mention must be made of Brenda Blethyn, Ronan and Goral who are impeccably immaculate. Vanessa Redgrave in a one-sequence shot is able to show her artistic talents as never before.

If it was not for the music, it could have been Ralph & Kirsten all over again!   Several times I had to pinch myself to convince that this time it was Keira & James, so close it comes to the theme & tone of English Patient.  But brilliant in its own right nonetheless.  Perhaps a soupcon of Ozon's "Swimming Pool" in the more reflexive considerations of art and art-form, and an epic Dunkirk beach-scene, a moving, thought-provoking movie.  And yes, one of my favourite photos of the White Cliffs of Dover.

I went to see this film yesterday and thought it was absolutely dreadful. I had read the book and thought it average, but the acting in the film was wooden (Keira Knightley was especially terrible as usual), some of the scenes were unnecessarily long, it didn't move me in any way. I felt detached from all the characters, there was nothing there to move me. On the plus side, some of the music was good. I wouldn't waste the time or the money to go and see this.

Why has this film been so hyped? The screenplay is poor with cardboard characters and give the actors few chances to shine except in the smaller character parts. The Direction is leaden and self indulgent. The plot is uninteresting and the alleged insight into the literary process that the film turns out to relate to represents little more than banal airmchair psychology.
There are many fine Directors working today even if cinema is in a long slow decline. Wright on this showing will never join their ranks.

An elegant, bitter-sweet tale of love, loss & loose morals... set against the backdrop of peace & war. The epic Dunkirk scene is the highlight of the film & is the most moving.

Calm down everyone. A solid enough film with a fine cast which will be swiftly forgotten. Note to screenwriters and directors: please do not attempt to film Birdsong. Ever.

This was a beautiful film, every scene was framed as if painted by a Renaissance master, but it left me cold. I had read the book and enjoyed it, but the film felt rushed in the first half and by the time we reach the scene where Robbie comes across a glade which is perfectly arranged with dead children, I just did not care.

Like many, having loved the book so much, I was anxious to see what became of the film, potentially so fabulous. Although beautifully shot, the whole was for me undermined by shocking acting by the leads. Keira Knightley's terribly wooden performance and ludicrous attempt at clipped 1930s English even managed to affect the wonderful James McAvoy.

After reading the reviews of this film I expected a lot. Unfortunately I was disappointed. It was a good  film but not a great one and in my view doesn't really deserve the amount of hype it is getting. I am not the only one who thought so. The scene in the library which sees Keira Knightley pinned against the wall made the cinema audience laugh, which as anyone who has read the book will know was not the author's intention. Knightley needs to extend her range of facial expressions. The best performance by far was Vanessa Redgrave, who manages to evoke with great depth and emotion every character she plays.  Pity we don't see more of her on the screen!

The first thing to say about Atonement is that it is an extremely well-made film and definitely one for anyone who appreciates the technical side of film making. There is one incredible 4-minute-plus continuous shot around the chaos of the Dunkirk beaches that deserves an Oscar on its own. It also helps that there is a gripping story to get involved in. The premise is very simple (a little lie goes a long way). but the way the situation develops makes for a really involving film. All three central characters are really well played and you can almost feel the sexual tension in the air, but I must give particular praise to James Mcevoy who is surely due an Oscar nod shortly. Atonement is not the sort of film I would usually choose to watch but I'm glad I did as it is, in my opinion, a leading contender for film of the year

I tried hard to resist, but was impossibly moved during the second half of the film. The thwarted love of the two protagonists becomes totemic for all the love killed by WWII, giving it a hugely powerful resonance. Additionally the pathos of the Dunkirk scene is irresistible - especially the dishevelled soldiers on the bandstand finding solace in singing the hymn "Dear Lord and Father of Mankind".

I enjoyed this film. Thought the actress who played the young Briony was terrific as was everyone else except for Keira. I could think of many other actresses who would have been far better in the role.

Yes, this is a good film, and it is certainly beautiful but is it a great film? No, I don't think so.  The "nods" to other great films may get it an Oscar but if I were to recommend it, it would be with the proviso that this is a beautiful film, don't expect too much.

Just a note on Philip French's review - McAvoy's character's mother is not the "cleaning lady" - an anachronistic term for that period - but the housekeeper, a totally different type of position socially.

Since Atonement was just released in the USA, this review is tardy.  Not having read the novel, I can say nothing about the filmâs fidelity to it.  The screenwriter (if not the novelist) may be criticized for too many unnecessary flashbacks.  The director or cinematographer may be criticized for relying on the old clichÃ©, fuzzy soft focus, to enhance a romantic situation.  The costume designer seemed to use Keira Knightley as a fashion model for 1935 dresses.
The music is good, but at times too loud and emphatic for the scene.  I disagree with many critics below in that I found the acting first-rate, with Saoirse Ronan especially commendable as the troubled thirteen year old Briony Tallis.  When it comes to production design and execution, I find the Dunkirk pre-evacuation set extraordinarily superb.  Finally, did anyone catch the brief scene in which Vanessa Redgrave as the elder Briony had Brionyâs wen on her left cheek instead of her right as it was throughout the rest of the film?
