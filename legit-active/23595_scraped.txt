FAQs
Got more questions? Hit us up at austinreggaefest@gmail.com
Can I buy tickets at the gate?
Of course!  If you didn't already buy a ticket you can purchase a ticket on your phone while you stand in line or buy a ticket with cash at the box office. Portions of all tickets go to the Central Texas Food Bank to help feed our neighbors.
I lost something...
We got you! Go to the front gate where you got your ticket, or look for the official T-Shirt booth. Our staff will help you out. If you already left the festival, shoot us an email at hello@austinreggaefest.com
Can I leave and then re-enter the festival?
VIP and Three Day Wristbands can leave and re-enter as you need. If you purchase a General Admission single day pass, then you can NOT re-enter Auditorium Shores after you leave the park. Sorry, mon!
Is there overnight camping at Auditorium Shores?
If you‚Äôre asking this question, you must be an OG of the Reggae Fest! Thanks for your continued love, but unfortunately we have to have the park cleared by 10pm each night. Therefore, there is no overnight camping at Auditorium Shores.
