WASHINGTON – There should be no such thing as too poor to buy pot if you live in D.C., at least if the marijuana is for a medical condition.
That’s part of the conclusion of a new law enacted in the nation’s capital earlier this year. The medical marijuana law allows people to legally obtain the drug for medical reasons. But the law also includes a provision different from the 14 other states with medical marijuana laws, requiring the drug to be provided at a discount to poor residents. Who will get the reduced-price marijuana and how much it will cost, however, is still being worked out.
City officials say they plan to publish their first draft of regulations implementing the law on Friday. Patients aren’t expected to be able to purchase medical marijuana in the city until 2011.
