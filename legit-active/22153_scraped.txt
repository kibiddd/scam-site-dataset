The B&B is lovely and clean, with understated but smart decor in the twin room we had in the attic. It is also in a lovely location up the hill from the main part of Oban (5 minute walk).We were not expecting breakfast but the owner showed us to a fully stocked kitchen and told us to help ourselves.I would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 20154.0 of 5 bubblesRooms4.0 of 5 bubblesService5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with friendsRoom Tip: Twin room up the top of the stairs on the left was lovely.See more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The B&B we'd tried to stop at was closed (though the sign said open). Carolyn cheerfully accommodated us in a clean, friendly room with a tiny, functional en suite bathroom (we want to adapt that sliding door for our home!). Great view out over Oban harbor and the town.She didn't bat an eye at us as a same-sex couple, which is always a pleasant experience. She pretty much left us to our own devices, but was available when we had questions, which I prefer over the B&B owners who treat guests as audiences for their personal foibles and fables.I loved that we could wander down the hill to her fabulous cafe for breakfast the next morning, at our leisure. The food was great, the service friendly, and the town definitely worth exploring.I would absolutely stay here again, and recommend to friends.Read moreDate of stay: March 20135.0 of 5 bubblesValue5.0 of 5 bubblesRooms5.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness5.0 of 5 bubblesService5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The room we stayed in had a double and single bed and a travel cot (which we had requested, it didn't have any bedding but ended up not using it anyway) The room had lovely big windows looking down over the harbour. The room  was spacious even with all the beds and had a TV, DVD player (CD player?), tea/coffee making facilities and an electric heater. The decor was lovely, not too plain. The bathroom was not en-suite but only across the corridor (literally 3 steps) and was lovely and big. Overall I felt very at home and would happily stay again and for longer a longer period.Read moreDate of stay: May 20134.0 of 5 bubblesValue5.0 of 5 bubblesRooms4.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness5.0 of 5 bubblesService5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Noone there to welcome us, but the key could be picked up from a board in the entrance. The room (no 1) was clean and functional, but very small and no view whatsoever. Just a skylight window.Breakfast is served in a nearby café, run by the guest house's owner, and it was perfectly good.The location is worth the VERY steep walk, if you get a room overlooking the bay.Read moreDate of stay: July 20143.0 of 5 bubblesValue4.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness2.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyRoom Tip: Make sure to get a room with a viewSee more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The sign outside says B&B but we were told that breakfast was available at additional cost at the cafe run by the owners. We were informed as we arrived that the cafe was not open on a Sunday and to help ourselves to cereal from the owners kitchen. As we had to leave early on the following morning we ended up eating breakfast on the Cal Mac ferry - excellent value and highly recommended. The view from the bedroom was very good but it's a very steep walk from the main street - you may want to factor in a taxi fare to the overall price - that plus the breakfast makes the proposition seem not quite so attractive.Read moreDate of stay: June 20123.0 of 5 bubblesValue4.0 of 5 bubblesRooms3.0 of 5 bubblesLocation5.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness2.0 of 5 bubblesService5.0 of 5 bubblesSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled as a coupleRoom Tip: Make sure it has a viewSee more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There seems to be a bit of confusion as breakfast is very much included in the price, it is served in our cafe which is just 2 mins down hill. The cafe is open all day on a Sunday from 9am and from 8am every other day,  If guests require an early breakfast on any day we offer a continental breakfast which is available in the kitchen and includes much more than cereal! As for our house and many guest houses, they are up the hill but to be fair the view makes it worth it. Sorry that the details were not explained to you fully and i hope the rest of your holiday was a good one.
