WORLD MAP
Why do we need to look at a World Map?
We need a world map to act as a reference point to all that what is happening in various parts of the world. A world Map works best with the data set it is mashed-up with. A World Map is a representation of all continents and countries in the world. Looking at a world map tells us the depth and shallowness of our knowledge about our world, at the same time.
