But in 'Dream On' the credits says that her character is Ilene Martin.Quotes[repeated line whenever Tim makes a smart comment on Tool Time] Al: I don't think so, Tim.Crazy creditsMost episodes featured outtakes from either Tool Time or the show itself
as a backdrop to the closing credits.Alternate versionsThe syndication version of the episode "I Was a Teenage Taylor" [6.7] contains a scene previously unincluded in the primetime version in which Tim brings his Halloween guy to the Tool Time set.ConnectionsEdited into Playboy: The Best of Pamela Anderson (1995)User reviews112ReviewFeatured reviewGreat fun for everyoneHome Improvement offers something for everyone in the family. It has these parents Tim Taylor (Tim Allen) and Jill Taylor (Patricia Richardson) and they have these teen boys Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and Mark (Taran Noah Smith).Tim has this show on TV called Tool Time with his Tool Time buddy Al (Richard Karn).On Tool Time Tim usually hurts himself and it's always a big disaster.And there is the tool girl Heidi (Debbe Dunning).The Taylor's have this neighbour Wilson (Earl Hindman) that the Taylor's can ask the advice for the problems.Wilson's face is always covered with something.So on Home Improvement you can watch an ordinary family with ordinary problems.And laugh at the same time.Too bad that the show ended this year.They did have great eight years.Petey-10Sep 8, 1999PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ24How many seasons does Home Improvement have?Powered by AlexaHow popular was Home Improvement against The Simpsons?Was Tool Time a local or national show?Why is Wilson's entire face never shown?DetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 17, 1991 (Canada)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asHammer TimeFilming locationsMichigan, USAProduction companiesTouchstone TelevisionWind Dancer ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime22 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Home Improvement (1991) officially released in India in Hindi?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episode
