The beautiful white sand and the view of the Kurima Island and the Kurima Ohashi Bridge are wonderful, attracting many tourists not only during the summer when swimming is possible, but also during the winter season. Therefore, restaurants on the beach are open during the winter season.The beach is generally visited by car, but it should be noted that there are not so many parking lots. On the other hand, during the non-bathing season, when only visitors come to admire the scenery, the parking lot is not occupied for very long and is rarely full.The beach is always kept beautiful, probably due to the cleaning work done by nearby residents. On the other hand, the trash cans by the restaurant are always full, so it's best to take your trash home with you and dispose of it whenever possible.In addition to the restaurant, there are only restrooms and shower facilities for a fee, but the lack of extras makes it a perfect spot to spend some time relaxing. It's warm throughout the year, so if you want to spend a relaxing time without losing track of time, it would be better to go there during the season when swimming is not available.Read moreReview of: Yonaha Maehama BeachWritten January 11, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It is an unusal bridge with a central hump to allow  boats to travel beneath it. Irabu Island  has some relatively new hotel developments and has some nice very clean beaches.Read moreReview of: Irabu OhashiWritten January 25, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Looks like there is some kind of concession in the tourist season. Snorkel rentals, maybe some food and drink. Funky little table and chairs scattered around. Could be nice for a picnic and beers.Read moreReview of: Aragusuku BeachWritten December 14, 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In miyakojima, it’s better drive as public transportation is really not convenient. But since I didn’t drive, I could only rent a bike. I rented an assistive bike from my hotel and it was super easy and energy saving. You can stop at anytime but of course not to block others’ way. There are some stoppable spots along the bridge and you can get some nice pictures and fresh air. Perhaps get yourself a drink so you can enjoy the scenery for a while?Biking is safe in miyakojima as the drivers usually would avoid getting close to the bike. Remember to apply sufficient sunscreen as I got sunburnt after not reapplying the sunscreen, especially the legs.

Mare Cruise was a perfect choice, they were extremely professional and English speaking as well. One could rent wetsuites and gears.I had a perfect day and the feeling that this is the most fantastic place I will ever see in my life. If you like snorkeling this is your heaven!!Very nice fishes but the corals take over the show! Fantastic forms and colors and the clearest water you can see in this tropical area of Japan!!! Really unique!Read moreReview of: YabijiWritten April 10, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It was designated a "Japanese National Scenic Spot" in 2007 and on a  nice day it is very pretty. There is a bus from the township, nit well signed for foreigners that takes you out to the area (about one hour) but it was not too frequent and returned via the airport.Read moreReview of: East Henna CapeWritten March 19, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Shimoji-jima island looks to be almost the western part of Irabu island.    There is the large Shimojijima airport - but I didn't see any planes there as well as the two ponds next to each other at Tooriike.     Linked to each other under the sea.    Open for exploration by advanced divers.Read moreReview of: Shimojishima IslandWritten November 9, 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A lot of snorkeling tours starts from this point, because Sea Bottom Is full of Coral and you can easily meet Sea turtles. The shigira beach is Sandy and you can rent beach umbrellas for family.
