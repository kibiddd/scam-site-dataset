Testimonials
“I have been taking my fur baby to Creature Comforts Pet Resort for the past eight years…and I would have it no other way…. as they are the absolute BEST in town!!!!”
— Deborah Read
“My dog and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. This outstanding staff insists on getting to know your dog before it's allowed out with the pack. (Start the process early, your dog will need to be evaluated ahead of daycare.) I was nervous boarding for the first time, but was totally reassured when my dog pulled me in the door for doggie daycare a couple of days later. They genuinely seem to enjoy my Australian Cattle Dog even though she can be a handful.”
— Terry Wohlfahrt
“I've recently learned how lucky we are to have found creature comforts! Cutie Pie loves to come and play and we feel & know she will be treated with the best care! The photos dont lie! We recently moved to Dallas and will drive 2 hours to bring her back anytime we need her to be boarded! This place and the staff is that amazing and it is clean!”
— Megan Falconer
“Best place for your fur babies. I love how they double check all animals. Clean and caring place for your peace of mind. Pictures daily and your welcome to call to check on your babies. We use them for all our vacations”
— Debra Brill
