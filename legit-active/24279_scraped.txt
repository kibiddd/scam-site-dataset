Normally, understanding that Altman's style is one of using confusion and misunderstandings to move the plot along, I was surprised when I reacted so positively to MASH, Nashville and The Player but not this.The cast, overall, is quite good with Robert Downey Jr. and Madeline Stowe giving the best performances along with the great Jack Lemmon in perhaps the scene with the only real emotional pull as he describes the sad truth of why his family broke apart. Everyone else seems lost and misguided, floating around in this LA world Altman is exploring without much to do. They act out, involving themselves in affairs, drugs, their children's lives and the simple desire to survive each day but none of it particularly moved me. Even one plot line involving Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell that should have had great emotional depth has almost none to speak of.I have the greatest admiration for Altman and his ambitious vision of how to create interesting stories and characters. Yet, despite many claiming this to be one of his best works, I didn't feel at all that it was on par with MASH or Nashville as it seemed to meander and sag heavily in the middle until a final occurrence brought many of the characters together. This may be what Altman wanted; the meaningless and accidental nature of many of life's adventures that nevertheless still affect us. However, I wish it would have been made more cinematically stimulating.bobsgrockJul 13, 2010PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Short Cuts?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 8, 1993 (Canada)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asLes chassés-croisésFilming locationsBronson Caves, Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park - 4730 Crystal Springs Drive, Los Angeles, California, USAProduction companiesFine Line FeaturesSpelling Films InternationalAvenue PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$12,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$6,110,979Gross worldwide$6,110,979See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime3 hours 8 minutesColorColorAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Short Cuts (1993) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
