“It's not any one thing that makes Alvin and Friends so special. Sure, the jazz music wafting through the speakers is inviting. And of course, the soulful paintings — all done by the owner — lining the dining room walls are absolutely mesmerizing. And then there's the transformative Southern/Caribbean cooking, which is a standout all on its own. But when you throw them all together...and add in all-smiles hospitality from owner Alvin Clayton - well then you have something really extraordinary. To put it simply: There's nothing else like it in Westchester. In fact, there may be nothing else like it anywhere.”
