(Serving Resume Clients Locally and Nationwide from 1988 to the Present) Hot Resume Tip!
Resume styles/Resume Writing has changed tremendously over the last 10-15 years. Resumes that just list job duties are outdated. New resume styles incorporate sections like Summary of Qualifications, Selected Accomplishments, Profile, and Areas  of Expertise. These sections do a much better job of selling you to a potential employer! Our experience (over 30,000 resume clients sought us out for resume writing and cover letter writing services) makes the difference for you.
