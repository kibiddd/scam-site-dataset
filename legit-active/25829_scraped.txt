Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He is best known for helping lead the United States into the Vietnam War during the Kennedy Administration, an act for which he spent the remainder of his life wrestling with the moral consequences.Early LifeRobert Strange McNamara was born on June 9,  1916, in San Francisco, California. In 1937, he graduated with a degree in economics from the University of California in Berkeley. An excellent student, McNamara went to study at Harvard Business School where he  earned his master's degree in 1939. After a short stint on the  West Coast, McNamara was back at Harvard as an assistant professor. He  took a break from the university to help out his country during World  War II. In 1943, McNamara entered the U.S. Army Air Corps, putting his  sharp analytical skills and talent for statistics to work in military situations. Not long after the war, he and nine other members from the  army's statistical control group went to work for Henry Ford II at the  Ford Motor Company.Secretary of DefenseFord hired this group of bright young men—sometimes referred to as  "Whiz Kids"—to help reinvigorate his family's company, which was going  through difficult times. Over the years, McNamara was promoted numerous  times and advocated for such changes as making small cars and increasing  safety. He also became known as a gifted, innovative manager with  strong organizational abilities. In 1960, McNamara became the first non-Ford family member to hold the position of president. However, he did not  stay in the job for long. President John F. Kennedy tapped him  to become his secretary of defense, looking to him to reorganize the  country's defense program. McNamara officially took over the post in  January 1961. Set on improving how the Pentagon operated,  McNamara helped establish planning and budgeting systems. To revitalize  the military, he emphasized the need for traditional troops and military  hardware as well as improved weapons systems. The country had to be  prepared for conventional and unconventional warfare, including guerilla  warfare. As secretary of defense, McNamara faced many challenges,  including 1962's Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the country to  brink of war with the Soviet Union. But perhaps his most complicated  crisis was the conflict in Vietnam. During the Kennedy Administration,  he supported increasing the number of U.S. military advisers in Vietnam.Vietnam WarLater, during the Johnson Administration, McNamara backed the  escalation of U.S. involvement after the Gulf of Tonkin incident in  1964, during which U.S. ships were allegedly attacked by the communist  North Vietnamese. President Lyndon B. Johnson retaliated with air strikes against  the northern targets. Supporting the North Vietnamese was the Viet Cong,  a militant communist group that opposed the U.S.-backed government in  South Vietnam. Employing guerilla warfare tactics, the group began  engaging in more military actions in 1965. In response, the United  States advanced the conflict in Vietnam by the use of extensive bombing  in the north and by deploying troops in the south. Considered to be one of the major strategists behind the  war, McNamara was reviled by many in the peace movement. Some were also  critical of the information he conveyed about the situation in Vietnam.  McNamara visited Vietnam several times during his tenure as secretary of  defense. During a later visit, he reportedly began to develop  reservations as to whether the United States would be able to secure a victory  over the communists. In 1967, McNamara ordered a study of the U.S. role in  Indochina, which was later leaked to the press and published as The Pentagon Papers.  The study covered from World War II to 1968 and contained many  revelations about the extent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam during  several administrations dating back to Harry S. Truman. One notable  discovery was that Johnson had U.S. forces engage in covert warfare  against the North Vietnamese in 1964.CriticismBy 1968, McNamara had become disillusioned about the Vietnam War.  Looking to take his life in a new direction, he resigned his position.  Clark M. Clifford took over as secretary of defense while McNamara  focused on helping developing countries as president of the World  Bank. During his 13 years with the bank, he oversaw the expansion  of its lending capabilities as well as numerous projects in borrowing  nations. After retiring in 1981, McNamara remained active in  many areas of public affairs, including world poverty and nuclear  policy. He wrote several books, most notably In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam (1995). In it, McNamara stated that he had sought to get the United  States to withdraw from Vietnam beginning in 1966. According to the  book, he was at odds with President Johnson over this issue. McNamara  wrote: "I do not know to this day, whether I quit or was fired."  Written with Brian VanDeMark, the controversial book was a best-seller.  While some found the book to be genuine and touching, others thought it  was simply a way for him to relieve some of his guilt over his role in  the Vietnam War.Later Years and DeathIn 2003, McNamara was once again in the spotlight with the release of the critically acclaimed documentary, The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons of Robert S. McNamara.  Most of the documentary featured interviews with McNamara, providing  some rationale for actions taken in Vietnam as well as insight into  their flaws. The following year, McNamara started a new chapter in his  personal life. He married Diana Masieri Byfield in September 2004. This was his second marriage; he was married to his first wife, Margaret Craig, from  1947 until her death in 1981. McNamara died on July 6, 2009, in Washington, D.C., from natural  causes. He was 93 years old. He was survived by Byfield, as well as a son  and two daughters from his first marriage.QUICK FACTSName:                                             Robert Strange McNamaraBirth Year:                                             1916Birth date: June 9,                                             1916Birth State:                                             CaliforniaBirth City:                                             San FranciscoBirth Country:                                             United StatesGender: MaleBest Known For: Robert S.
