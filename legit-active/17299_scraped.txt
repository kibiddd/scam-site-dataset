Just got back from Side flying with TC. They have withdrawn the music and film channels they used have from 'short haul' flights. Even the staff did the safety instructions when it used to be a video. One of the girls told me that the system was old and outdated and cost a fortune to maintain. I hope their aircraft are in better nick!
I walked into Side on the new walkway, it was great, found loads of bars I never knew existed. I also looked for Ken's [One for the Road] new place the Kelebek but failed. His map is crap.

I wonder if I will get a refund on the two sets of earphones I bought for the grand children on our flight out May 2010.

I heard that Ken  is not at the Kelebek anymore, (and its been renamed the not so clever Titanic) not sure of the whole story but understand he does the quiz and karaoke nights at the Bern/Fox.
Kelebek (Titanic) is nearly opposite the White Horse on Yali Mah, Kazimkarabekir Caddesi just along from Korelis.

The last time we flew Thomas Cook we bought 2 sets of headphones, the movie came on, it was Mr Bean, nobody speaks in this movie!  Thomas Cook have stopped inflight entertainment thinking people like their own entertainment.  We play guess what they have given us to eat?
You can take on board your own portable dvd player, handheld games consoles, CD, i Pod, MP3 players ect. So I am taking a full drum kit!
Penny pinching company? and yet £12 per kilo for excess baggage.:hmm:

Ah, I know the White Horse and I am sure I passed the Titanic. Whats the Bern/Fox? I dont go to the Kemer area that often, my place is off the Kumcoy Road.

The Fox (previously The Bern) is a hotel just up from the Selge Hotel, which is opposite the Kelebek (Titanic)

To be honest the films are no good anyway out of date or repeated on most flights , boreing , i'd rather listen to the music , as for the meals i don't buy them anymore , I try to pop into M&S and buy sandwiches and triffle and crisps etc , But i allways fly with them , i like them because they allow free luggage for charitys , like Kaplumba's books and boxe;s for the schools and i've taken stuff for Fig ...20kilos free ...their not so bad ,,Honest ........Diane

Good game that - "guess what they have given us to eat" - only problem is that they only seem to have two menus - pretend sausage and mash or pretend chicken.

Hi Modgirl,
:drum:I have just been on the phone to Thomas Cook, sorry no drum kits allowed in the passenger cabin.  So we will have to buy an on board meal, and use the rubber sausages and/or the chicken drumsticks to hammer on the drop down table, the eggs can be our cymbals:drum::hehe:  Enjoy your next holiday.
