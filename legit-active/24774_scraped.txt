It's Saturday morning which means a long, long day of watching college football.
For the Kansas City Chiefs, it means another step in the scouting process for 2011. Chris Steuber of CBSSports.com reports that Chiefs scouts will attend at least a couple of games (and likely more) on Saturday.
I've listed the SB Nation blogs that go along with it and I think it might be a good idea to hop on over there today and ask the fans who their NFL draft prospects are. After all, the fans know best, right?
Ohio State vs. Illinois
SB Nation Ohio State: Along The Olentangy
SB Nation Illinois: Hail To The Orange
Other teams scouting: Bears, Chargers, Cowboys, Giants and Vikings
Miami vs. Clemson
SB Nation Miami: 7th Floor Blog (great blog name)
SB Nation Clemson:Shakin' The Southland
Other teams scouting: 49ers, Bears, Bucs, Falcons, Jaguars, Saints and Titans
