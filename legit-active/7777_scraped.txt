Russ Jackson
Russell Stanley Jackson, OC (born July 28, 1936), is a former professional Canadian football player. Jackson spent his entire 12-year professional football career with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League. He is a member of the Order of Canada, the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, and has been described as the best Canadian-born quarterback to play in the CFL. In 2006, Jackson was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#8) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN, the highest-ranked Canadian-born player on the list.
Early life and college career
After a stellar college career as both a basketball and football player, Jackson graduated from McMaster University in 1958 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. He was the McMaster nominee for a Rhodes Scholarship, but did not pursue an interview for the scholarship, deciding instead to sign with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League, who drafted him in the first round of the 1958 CFL draft.

Famous quotes by Russ Jackson:
"The accident is still under investigation."
"I don't know, it really scares me. To start it all over again is going to be very difficult and there is some question whether the fans will come back. I really don't know because how many times can you go to the well?"
"It's just disappointing. I just wonder how many times the Ottawa football fan is going to put up with this."
