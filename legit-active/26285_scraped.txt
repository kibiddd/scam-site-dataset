Site is Closed
Update (May 26, 2020)
The OlyMadMen who provided the data behind the Sports Reference Olympic site have reopened
Olympedia.org. Please check it out and here is the announcement of its re-opening.
Update (May 14, 2020)
We have closed the site permanently. Any questions or comments should be directed to OlyMadMen or in an email to
[email protected]. Their intent is to collaborate on a new site in time for the Tokyo games.
Update (December 31, 2019)
I know this notice has been up for at least three years now, but we are moving servers in Q1 of 2020 and the olympics site will not be making that move and all pages and data will be removed. The OlyMadMen who provide the data for
this site are working with the IOC to produce a new site. We have been maintaining this site gratis for the past two years and have earned no income from these pages. Any questions or comments should be directed to
OlyMadMen.
Site Closing (December 16, 2016)
We are sorry to inform you that due to a change to our data licensing agreement we are shutting down our Olympic site sometime in the future..
The providers of our dataset are working with another publisher to create an extensive site chronicling the history of the Olympic Movement. We will provide information here when that site is available.
We will continue to have Olympic Ice Hockey Stats and
Olympic Basketball Stats.
