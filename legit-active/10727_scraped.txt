Cave Diver Courses
Available courses include those needed to achieve Full Cave Diver certification and specialty courses such as Stage and DPV Cave Diver.
Tech Diver Courses
Our technical diver courses range from Nitrox Diver to Hypoxic Trimix and can be conducted in either a cave or ocean environment.
Rebreather Courses
Rebreather training is conducted on four popular rebreather models. Other CCR courses include Cave CCR.
Cave Instructor Courses
Instructor courses are available for divers interested in becoming a Cavern, Apprentice Cave, or Full Cave Instructor through NAUI or NSS-CDS. The NAUI or NSS-CDS Cave Instructor crossover course is also offered.
Coaching/Consulting
We offer coaching/consulting for divers who want to improve existing skills, learn new skills, or refresh old skills. This is typically done outside a certification course.
Guided Dives
Guided dives are available for divers who need a dive buddy, want to explore different caves, or conduct dives that are a step above their current certification level.
