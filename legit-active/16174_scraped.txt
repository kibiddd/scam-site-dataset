I had no problem driving up to the front door and there was staff offering to help with my bags.  Check-in was a breeze and again, the staff was pleasant.  This is one of those hotels where you go for the history and experience rather than the amenities.  If it was not the "Queen Mary" would I stay there?  Probably not.  But it is and it is indeed unique.  My room was adequate although it was noisy.  I heard a gentleman next door as he called home telling them he had rabbit and lobster bisque for dinner and it was delicious.  Yes, the prices are high.  It's the Queen Mary folks.  You pay for the history.MoreDate of stay: March 2009Trip type: Traveled on business4.0 of 5 bubblesValue3.0 of 5 bubblesRooms4.0 of 5 bubblesLocation4.0 of 5 bubblesCleanliness4.0 of 5 bubblesService 1 Thank ARTravelersProblem with this review?This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Con FAthens, Greece43Reviewed March 14, 2009 Most interesting. Unique.We decided to use this hotel for a two-night after-cruise stay. We would complete a South America circumnavigation on the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship, ending at Los Angeles, and this was a convenient opportunity to taste the original ship after the modern one.When entering the Queen Mary, it is important to know that this is a kind of a fascinating museum rather than a modern hotel. Remember, it is old and it looks like that. It is a time-capsule that transports you back to an age much different than our own.  You must not expect modern luxury, otherwise go elsewhere. Adjust your senses to 'smell' the original atmosphere. If you do it, you are guaranteed an interesting and fun stay, a unique experience, since nothing else like it has survived anywhere.The ship/hotel  is located at some distance from the city, but it provides a free shuttle, running every ten minutes to the centre of Long Beach, and stopping conveniently closely to everything, from Walmart to bars and restaurants. The location of the hotel affords a beautiful view of the city of Long Beach and its harbour. We got upgraded to a Deluxe stateroom, an original First Class cabin, which was very spacious. It had ample space between beds, a small separate sitting area and ample storage space. When you book, ask to be given a stateroom with a harbour view, which, as I said, is very nice. On the setbacks, sound-proofing was not good seventy years ago, so ask that your neighbouring rooms are empty.You will find nice shops on board for shopping. The front panoramic bar is also worth a visit. Stroll in the wonderful promenade decks or the spacious corridors between cabins, among old elegance and luxury. The ship is a labyrinth waiting to be explored. Original ocean liner items are exhibited everywhere. And you feel that it is maintained with love and care. You can also take the guided tours. They take you to parts of the ship that are otherwise closed to the public. Overall, we had a wonderful and memorable experience. I believe most people should stay at least one night in this unique hotel/museum.Date of stay: February 2009Trip type: Traveled as a coupleAsk Con F about The Queen Mary1  Thank Con F This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

CathyB97Cincinnati, Ohio1215Reviewed January 16, 2009 Over-rated  and definitely not first-classHusband and I stayed for 2 nights over New Years Holiday.  No Bell-hop available and could not pull up to entrance to unload. We had to park in lot and carry bags over 400 feet to entrance. Check-in was slow and when it was our turn employee had confusion with the reservation (could not pull up information from confirmation number).  Poor signage to room and we wandered down several hallways before another guest helped us find our suite.  Afterwards, we helped two other sets of lost guests find their rooms.  Attempted to have drinks (2 rounds) in bar but appetizer order was lost and waitress acted as if she was always 'busy' even though only 4 other tables were occupied.  Dinner and breakfast in restaurants were a similar experience.  Tours were great and tour hosts were extremely knowledgeable and interesting.  Room accommodations were on the cheap with styrofoam cups for coffee and a one-cup coffee maker.Date of stay: January 2009Trip type: Traveled as a coupleValueLocationCheck in / front deskRoomsCleanlinessServiceBusiness service (e.g., internet access)Ask CathyB97 about The Queen Mary1  Thank CathyB97 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

stjans520Calgary, Alberta1218Reviewed December 23, 2008 Wonder Hotel.... but little sound proofing.We arrived and checked in no problems. The elevators are a bit small, but given the age of the ship that is to be expected. The rooms were awesome. The carpet was to be desired since I think it is all the same since it was built. We liked how it felt like it was still 50 years ago. We did encounter problems however. You could hear people talking out in the hall way, and they were not talking that loud. Also they were having a wedding and some Christmas Party's that night (saturday). The beds were vibrating from the party a floor below us! We did call security about the people in the hall way and they send someone but it did continue until about 3am. The music and booming from the party finally ended at around midnight. We were getting up the next day to get on the Carnival cruise. Despite the bad sleep we did enjoy touring the ship, and seeing everything. The breakfast we had was quite good as well. The coffee in the room was to be desired. I had booked 2 rooms for the night, and when we checked out we did say how upset we were with the loud music they did offer their apologies but that was it. That was a bit disappointing since the rooms were expensive.Date of stay: December 2008Trip type: Traveled with familyValueLocationCheck in / front deskRoomsCleanlinessServiceBusiness service (e.g., internet access)  >Ask stjans520 about The Queen Mary2  Thank stjans520 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

suz_work2travelhouston, tx1217Reviewed December 20, 2008 An interesting ship, but a stay marred by bugs and bad serviceStayed on the QM with a friend in a deluxe stateroom on "A" deck.  We were there for a paranormal retreat, and while the ship did satisfy us in that department, the ship as a hotel definitely has some issues.  1.  Restaurant staffing (esp. when there is large, on-board events) is insufficient - There were about 200 of us (in addition to any other guests) on the ship for this several-day event.  We usually had only an hour, maybe two hours for lunch or dinner.  Restaurant options are limited, esp. at dinner - there is a Promenade deck restaurant, and the Observation bar, with a menu, which must use the same kitchen as the restaurant.  One night when we had two hours for dinner, we realized the slow service we had experienced previously at the Promenade restaurant would not get us out in time for our event.  We went to the Observation Bar to get whatever we could there...service was very slow, WE had to ask for drink refills, and it took my friend over an hour to get her bar food - she had to get a to-go box and eat at the event.  And she probably wouldn't have gotten her food (nachos, people!) had we not been so persistent.  We left no tip.  A lady we sat next to, her husband was waiting for her food from the Promenade restaurant.  She waited about 1.5 hrs for her food, and ate hers at the lecture event as well.  Ridiculous.1a.  There's not any eateries near the QM, so one really is limited to what is on the ship if in a time crunch, like we usually were for our event.  There is a free bus that will take people into Long Beach, where there are more options, but we just didn't have time.  The hotel needs to take this into consideration when they have conferences at their hotel (and they apparently don't care, because obviously ours was not the first conference they've had there).2.  We had bugs in our bathroom - Not sure what they were - these were light brown with long wings (a form of cockroach?  Other?) and smallish, but there were several there.  They would hide out in the folds of the towels.  Upon checkout, my friend described the problem to the front desk manager.  The manager told us that if we had told her before checking out (like, the day before), she would have comped our room.  I couldn't understand what difference it made *when* we complained.  After arguing with her, she comped our room from one night, and credited our parking fees.  One has to fight for customer service when things go wrong.3.  Things were taken from our room - by housekeeping?  Although these items were returned.  They were inconsequential items to anyone else, but I noticed them gone - the next day I filed a report with Security.  Security tells me housekeeping says they don't know anything about the missing items and that they will check the trash, etc.  The day after filing my report and AFTER housekeeping is there (we weren't there when housekeeping was), the items mysteriously return, and they don't look like they've been in the trash.  I can't say the removal was intentional, but who knows?  I am glad to have the missing items returned, but it was very strange.  Be aware.The QM is an interesting ship, but is probably more suited to a day visit than a stay.  Although staff could be helpful at times, customer service in general is lacking, and has to be forced in some instances.  One should not have to ask a hotel for the appropriate customer service action when things go poorly.  There are lessons that need to be learned and applied at the QM.  I sincerely hope they improve, because the negative can overshadow the history and interest folks have in the ship itself.Date of stay: December 2008ValueLocationCheck in / front deskRoomsCleanlinessServiceBusiness service (e.g., internet access)Ask suz_work2travel about The Queen Mary3  Thank suz_work2travel This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

EscapeProjectBuffalo Mountain Resort, Virginia11Reviewed December 9, 2008 Exciting to be on the Queen Mary again.  Historical; unforgettable.Memorable accommodations.  Much of the Queen Mary is the same as it was when she was sailing--I remember from being a passenger from New York to Southampton in the sixties.  The art decco additions were disappointing--why not make the interior as authentic as possible?  Self-guided tours effective.  On board restaurant excellent.  Staff exceptional.  Front desk assistants took every possible opportunity to achieve excellence.  Spencer M. Day even took the trouble to weigh himself on ship's scale to make sure it was accurate enough to weigh luggage for flight!
