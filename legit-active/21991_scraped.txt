This week, our Chief Commercial Enablement Officer Jeff Long sat down with Bloomberg's Lisa Mateo to talk about how capabilities like commercial insights, advanced analytics, category management and digital are helping our sales and marketing teams stay ahead of the curve with consumers, retailers and our distributor partners.
These capabilities underpin our strategic ambitions as a business, like keeping our core power brands strong and transforming our portfolio through premiumization in beer and beyond beer, including our continued expansion into non-alc beverages. So, what did Jeff have to say about his team's role in driving Molson Coors forward? Here are three takeaways:
✔ Category First, Molson Coors Best.
Using this mindset is the most important thing our commercial team can do for our business, customers and consumers. When we do what’s best for the category, we position Molson Coors and our partners to win no matter what’s going on in the broader environment.
✔ Purpose drives Purchase.
Gone are the days of believing shoppers buy the first item they see on a shelf or buy purely based on cost. We believe shoppers enter stores with a whole lot of purpose, driven by the social occasions they're buying for. Where a consumer will be and who they'll be with weigh heavily on their choices, and our portfolio is designed to offer a range of options for a wide variety of occasions.
✔ Investing in capabilities = investing in the future.
Molson Coors goes deep on first-party consumer research. We work with consumers to co-create new products and additionally, recently conducted a landmark study of 16,000 legal-drinking-age consumers to refine our understanding of mindful drinking habits. This knowledge sets us apart and allows us to innovate and connect with our consumers today and in the future.

When chain beverage executives from across the on-premise industry met last week at the annual Vibe Conference in San Diego, they handed out awards to celebrate the best adult beverage suppliers.
And for the third and fourth times, respectively, Molson Coors and Fever-Tree came out on top.
Molson Coors won the “Best Large Beer Supplier” award, while Fever-Tree was named the “Best Small Non-Alcohol Supplier.”

Congratulations to Natalie Maciolek for making Wisconsin Law Journal’s “Powerlist – In-House Counsel,” a list recognizing the “who’s-who of in-house general counsel from across the state.”
The publication notes she has a “full glass” at Molson Coors as the Chief Legal & Government Affairs Officer and Corporate Secretary, where she deals with several legal matters, including “corporate governance, securities law, regulatory compliance and government affairs.”
Maciolek has a deep connection to Wisconsin, attending the University of Wisconsin Law School and even interning as a legal clerk at Miller Brewing. After years at other area businesses, she joined Molson Coors in 2023.

How did a 150-year-old brand become the fastest-growing beer for legal drinking-age Gen-Z?
Coors Banquet’s results have been hard to deny for several years now. Now it’s also the fastest-growing beer among legal drinking-age Gen Z, posting a 32% increase versus the previous year according to a Circana Receipt Panel.
Find out how Coors Banquet’s 150-year-plus legacy and deep connection to the West is leading to success: https://bit.ly/437jEBq

Since launching in 2022, Simply Spiked has focused on bringing the real fruit juice flavor that its fans crave. Now the brand is ready for its latest move: Simply Spiked Bold.
Just like Simply Spiked, Simply Spiked Bold is made with 5% real fruit juice, squeezed then concentrated, but with a more intense flavor and an 8% ABV. Available now nationwide, the brand comes in two fan-favorite flavors that fans of Simply Spiked know well – Signature Lemonade and Cherry Limeade.

Today, we reported our Q4 and Full Year 2024 results, delivering our third consecutive year of bottom-line growth. During the earnings call, CEO Gavin Hattersley described 2024 as a “year of progress,” where Molson Coors focused on delivering our Acceleration Plan. He also shared our confidence in our plans and the strength of our strategy for 2025.
Watch the video to hear from Gavin as he thanks our employees, customers and partners across the globe.
"2024 can be summarized as a year of progress. Progress that kept our global core power brands strong. Progress that drove premiumization in key regions like Canada and EMEA & APAC. And progress that laid the groundwork to greatly expand our non-alc portfolio in the U.S. Last year was proof that our Acceleration Plan is helping us move forward with meaningful progress toward our ambition as a total beverage company, and our 2025 priorities are clear: build on the strength of our global core power brands, premiumize our portfolio in beer and Beyond Beer, including non-alc beverages, and invest behind world-class capabilities across our operations and our commercial business.
The plans I’ve seen this year make me confident that we’ll continue to see progress across our business in the years to come. Our work in 2024 set us up for even greater progress ahead. We are consistently demonstrating that our long-term vision is one to watch … and I thank each of you for your support in making this happen."
