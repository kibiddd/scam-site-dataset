Synopsis
Early on a September morning, drifter Hal Carter rides a freight train into a small Kansas town seeking his old college friend, wealthy Alan Benson. Wandering toward town, Hal stops in front of elderly Helen Potts' house and asks if he might do any odd jobs for her, but Helen declines, explaining that it is Labor Day and everyone is preparing for the annual town picnic.  Charmed by Hal's direct sincerity, Helen nevertheless allows him to clean her lawn and prepares him lunch.  Hal then asks Helen about the Bensons, and she reveals that Alan is dating her neighbor, the beautiful Madge Owens, who lives with her mother Flo and younger sister Millie.  Next door, meanwhile, Millie and Madge quibble about boys while spinster schoolteacher Rosemary Sydney, who boards with the Owens, dismisses the romantic prospect of the picnic. Later that morning, Hal arrives at the Bensons' affluent home to reunite with a delighted Alan, and the young men reminisce about college.  At the Owens' home, Flo fits Madge with a striking new dress for the picnic, and inquires about the seriousness of Madge's relationship with Alan.  While Millie laments that she is always overlooked because of Madge's good looks, Madge envies Millie her college scholarship and intellect.  When Alan drives Hal to the family business, Hal confides his determination to find success and Alan agrees to give him an entry-level job at the company. Alan then invites Hal to join him and the Owenses for a swimming date and the picnic.  After the swim, Alan confidently predicts that Madge will be crowned the seasonal Queen of Neewollah, "Halloween" spelled backwards.  Later, at the Owens' house, Rosemary bitterly speculates that her beau, mild businessman Howard Bevans, will arrive for the picnic drunk.  Flo is disappointed when Madge decides to wear a less fancy dress to the picnic, but pleased that Alan is nevertheless attentive to her daughter. While Hal drives Millie to the picnic in one of Alan's cars, Flo rides with Madge and Alan.  Worried that Hal might be a bad influence, Flo questions Alan about him and learns that Hal grew up poor and won a sports scholarship to college, but nevertheless flunked out.  On their way to the picnic, Rosemary initially resists Howard's offer of a sip of whiskey, but then gives in.  During the festive afternoon, Hal joins Millie in several contests, and after the group eats, Alan grows annoyed with Hal's good-natured tall-tales while noticing, along with Flo, Hal and Madge's mutual attraction. As the sun sets, Howard and Rosemary continue to drink and Rosemary grows increasingly restless. The Owenses and their friends then excitedly gather on the pier to hear the announcement for the "Neewalloh" queen and are pleased when Madge is presented on as the winner.  Dancing begins and a drunken Rosemary attempts to make Howard dance with her. When he refuses, Rosemary forces Millie to dance with her, and Hal playfully dances with Howard, which enrages Rosemary.  Hal then dances with Millie until Madge spots them.  When Madge and Hal begin a sensuous dance together, Helen watches admiringly, but Flo is alarmed.  Also disturbed by the couple's intimacy, Rosemary lashes out at Hal and drunkenly breaks up their dance, embarrassing Hal by tearing his shirt when he attempts to pull away from her.  When Millie declares she is feeling ill, Flo blames Hal for getting her drunk.  Alan arrives and viewing the spectacle, accuses Hal of being a fake and a bum.  Distraught, Hal rushes away and is followed by Madge.  Howard apologizes to the group for providing the whiskey, while in the parking lot, Madge apologizes to Hal for Alan, but Hal angrily tells her that he is leaving town on the next freight train. When Madge tries to convince Hal to remain, he calls himself a bum and admits he went to reform school and lost countless unsuccessful jobs. Madge nevertheless praises Hal, admiring his confidence and carefree nature. When Hal reveals that his parents rejected him, Madge kisses him and confides her fear of being cared for only because of her looks.  Hal misses the next freight train and stays with Madge. Howard, meanwhile,  drives a dejected Rosemary home, and she pleads with him to marry her, explaining that her life is utterly empty.  When he refuses and asks for things to remain the same between them, Rosemary declares they cannot see each other again unless he intends to marry her. Hal escorts Madge home early in the morning, concerned about her and whether he should remain in town and work for the Bensons.  Later, when Hal returns the car to the Bensons, he discovers that Alan has reported the car stolen and summoned the police.  When Alan demands that the police arrest Hal, Hal insists that Alan admit he leant him the car and that his anger is really jealousy over Madge.  Alan strikes Hal, who knocks him and the policemen down before fleeing in Alan's car.  Hal abandons the car, evades the police and rushes to Howard's for help.  The next morning, when Howard comes to the Owenses to reiterate that he will not wed Rosemary, she misunderstands and enthusiastically tells everyone that they are marrying.  Flo informs Madge that Alan has telephoned, while Howard secretly tells her that Hal is waiting to see her outside.  Madge meets Hal in the yard where he reveals that although he must leave town, he loves her and wants her to come to Tulsa with him.  Panicked, Flo intervenes and begs Madge to stay and marry Alan, but Hal pleads with Madge to do what she wants.  Confused, Madge does not respond and, while rushing away to catch a passing freight train, Hal continues beseeching Madge to join him.  Later, in their bedroom, Millie confronts Madge, encouraging her sister to be smart and to go with Hal.  When Madge comes downstairs with her suitcase packed, Flo becomes hysterical, but Madge remains determined. Helen comforts Flo as Madge catches the Tulsa-bound bus.

"From the moment he hit town she knew it was just a matter of time."
Tag line for Picnic
William Holden worked against type to play the sex-charged drifter Hal who
brings new life to the women of a small, stifling town in Kansas in the
1955 screen version of Picnic.  Though some critics carped that the
37-year-old actor was not young enough for the role -- or for the play's
sexual shenanigans -- he proved them wrong, establishing himself as a major
sex symbol with his performance and rising to the top of the year's annual
box-office polls.
Picnic had first set pulses racing in 1953 on Broadway, where it won
a Pulitzer Prize for playwright William Inge and a Tony for director Joshua
Logan.  Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn picked up the film rights and,
hoping to make the film a critical hit as well as a popular one, asked
Logan to undertake his first solo directing assignment.  Logan had worked
in Hollywood in the '30s as a dialogue director, then shared a directing
credit with Arthur Ripley on the 1938 thriller I Met My Love Again.
Unhappy in Hollywood, he returned to Broadway, scoring a series of stage
hits, including Annie Get Your Gun, South Pacific and Mr.
Roberts.
Holden was at the end of his Columbia contract when he signed to play Hal.
He only owed the studio one more film and had to settle for a paltry
$30,000 fee under his contract.  At the time, he was coming off a string of
hits including Sabrina (1954), with Audrey Hepburn, and The Country
Girl (1954), with Grace Kelly, and his going rate as a free-lance actor was
$250,000 per picture.  Nonetheless, he was happy to finish his contract
with such a prestigious project.  He only balked at two things, the dance
scene and the requirement that he strip to the waist for several scenes,
complaining, "I'm too damned old and too conservative to do a striptease."
But he was also too professional to let the production down, so he went
back to the gym so he would be in good shape for the role and even consented
to shaving his chest to conform to current standards of masculine
beauty.
Logan asked Arthur O'Connell to re-create his stage performance as
shopkeeper Howard Bevans, which would launch him on a long career as one of
Hollywood's top character actors.  Susan Strasberg had just scored a
Broadway hit in The Diary of Anne Frank, which led to her screen
debut as a small-town tomboy in Picnic.  Also earning his first
big-screen credit was Cliff Robertson as the college buddy who loses his
fiance to Hal.  The role's originator, Paul Newman, was unavailable as he
was just starting his rise to stardom at Warner Bros.  For the flashy
supporting role of Rosemary, the aging schoolteacher driven to a drunken
frenzy by Hal's presence, Logan wanted to cast his friend Rosalind Russell,
but was afraid she'd balk at taking the lesser role.  When he called her
and asked, "Would you like to do Pic...?" she said yes before he could
finish the sentence.
Casting the female lead was much harder.  Madge is a small-town beauty
queen with a heart, a role requiring an actress who could be both sexy and
emotionally responsive.  Janice Rule had played the role on stage, but
though Logan tested her repeatedly, they couldn't capture her beauty and
sex appeal on film.  He also tested the young Carroll Baker, but she was
too childlike.  Cohn wanted the studio's resident blonde bombshell, Kim
Novak, for the role, but though noted for her beauty, she was considered
somewhat deficient in the acting department.  Some stories state that he
forced her on Logan.  The director would later say that he tested her
repeatedly and finally decided she would be perfect, then had to sell her
to producer Fred Kohlmar and writer Daniel Taradash.  Reportedly, for one
of her last tests he instructed actor Aldo Ray, who was subbing for Holden,
to "get some emotion from her any way you can, short of rape."  She
finally won over the entire production crew, though Logan then shocked Cohn
by demanding that her trademark lavender blonde hair be darkened for the
role.
Logan also insisted on two weeks of rehearsals at a cost of $20,000 a day.
From the start, Novak felt insecure around the high-voltage cast, which led
to her becoming withdrawn and moody.  Holden was insecure, too, worried
that he would look too old next to her.  When he tried to get her to loosen
up, she shrugged him off.  As a result, they barely spoke on the set.
Logan's frustrations with her mounted throughout filming.  At one point, he
reportedly punched her in the stomach to get her to show some emotion on
screen.  It must have worked, as many critics were surprised at her
effective dramatic performance.
Most of the picture was filmed on location around Hutchinson, Kansas, which
gave Logan the opportunity to show the Labor Day picnic on screen where it
had only been talked about on stage.  In exchange for local color and
hundreds of eager extras, however, he and the cast had to deal with harsh
summer weather, including a tornado that interrupted one night scene.  He
also wanted to show Hal's athletic prowess on screen.  One night in the
company hotel, he asked Holden if he could do any gymnastic tricks, not
realizing the actor was a trained gymnast.  Holden handed his drink to
somebody, opened a window and dangled from the ledge -- ten stories above
the ground.  He refused to come in until the director, who was afraid of
heights, actually came to the window and watched him.
The one thing that panicked Holden was the thought of dancing on screen.
When he had been forced to dance with Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina, he
went on a three-day drunk as a way of handling the ordeal.  Logan had
choreographer Miriam Nelson take Holden to the local roadhouses, where he
could get drunk while dancing to the jukeboxes.  The director thought he'd
solved the problem, but just as they started to film the dance on location,
the set was hit with a hailstorm.  They ended up having to shoot the scene
on a Hollywood soundstage.  Once back there, Holden demanded stunt pay for
doing the dance.  Cohn wrote him a check for $8,000, but the actor still
needed a few belts in him to face the scene.  When Logan finally got some
footage, it was a disaster to rival the hail storm and tornado.  As he
would write in his memoirs, "They [Holden and Novak] bobbed about awkwardly
like grade-schoolers."   Finally, cinematographer James Wong Howe solved
the problem by having the lights and camera do the dancing.  He placed the
camera on a dolly that allowed it to circle the stars while also swaying up
and down.  He also set up 50 small, brightly colored spotlights so that the
smallest movements changed the colors on the stars.  The result was a
classic scene.  Composer George Duning had combined his theme for the film
with the '30s standard "Moonglow," and the movie made "Moonglow" a hit all
over again.  After the film came out, a friend wrote Logan that he'd
overheard two elderly ladies in a diner listening to the song.  One of them
said, "Isn't that the theme from Picnic?"  "I don't know," said the
other, "but every time I hear it I want to get laid."
Picnic inspired similar feelings in fans around the country,
becoming one of the year's top box-office attractions with $6.3 million in
rentals.  Released late in 1955, it helped make Holden the top box-office
star of 1956 and paved the way for even greater success.  The day he
finished work on the film, Holden shared a drink with Logan and Cohn in the
film mogul's office.  As they sipped their Scotches, Holden informed Cohn
that he would never work for him again, complaining that his small fees at
Columbia had averaged out to just $50 a week.  Still, Cohn insisted on
toasting Holden's next picture there.  A year later, Cohn came calling with
another film, The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), that would make Holden a
multi-millionaire and an international superstar.

The Kim Novak Collection - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT & JEANNE EAGELS Highlight THE KIM NOVAK COLLECTION on DVD
July 27, 2010
Share
Sony remasters its top Kim Novak gems for this nicely appointed disc set, a collection
graced with the presence of the legendary actress herself. This is indeed a unique
occasion, as the wisely privacy-minded Ms. Novak has made very few personal appearances
since retiring from the screen. We've known her only through her glamorous film roles and
not through a publicity smokescreen or a history of self-promotion. The result is that
the captivating star of great pictures like Vertigo still retains the power to
fire our imaginations. A potent 1950s sex symbol, Novak is a class act all the way.
The movies in Sony's The Kim Novak Film Collection take her appeal in four
different directions. Picnic gives Novak her most iconic role. Madge Owens is the
Kansas high school prom queen desperate to escape her identity as the 'local beauty'.
Madge's mother Flo (Betty Field) wants to hurry her marriage to the local rich kid Alan
Benson (Cliff Robertson), but Madge unconsciously envies her brighter, less dazzling
sister Millie (Susan Strasberg), who hates small town life and wants to run away to New
York to "write books to shock everybody". Meanwhile, the spinster schoolteacher Rosemary
(Rosalind Russell) is living another female nightmare -- well into middle age, she's
desperate to marry the local merchant Howard Bevans (Arthur O'Connell).
The catalyst arrives in the form of Hal Carter (William Holden), a former college buddy
of Alan's who tells spicy tales of bumming around Hollywood and wants to beg Alan's dad
for a job. Hal talks big but can't hide the fact that he's a bum and will have to start
as a laborer. That doesn't decrease his appeal to Madge, much to the horror of her
mother. Hal's virility also upsets Rosemary, who causes a scene at the grand Labor Day
picnic that gets them all into trouble. The film's classic scene is an almost magical
evening dance at the picnic. Hal and Madge suddenly know that they're fated for each
other, in a relationship with little hope for a future.
Made on location at great expense, Picnic is an exceptional Columbia film.
Cinematographer James Wong Howe's warm, diffuse colors give the show a special look for
its year (1955), transforming the harvest picnic into a painfully poignant ritual for
those in desperate need to change their lives. Director Joshua Logan handles the actors
extremely well, and the camera blocking is worked out to perfection. The superb dialogue
by William Inge, the original author of the Broadway play, gives William Holden a
terrific opportunity to show how appealing he can be as a tough-guy loser. We soon forget
that Holden is at least ten years too old to play Hal. Kim Novak's part seems almost
autobiographical -- the deceptively "shallow" girl weary of being told she's beautiful.
It's said that Inge adapted Picnic and Splendor in the Grass from
real events he witnessed back in Independence, Kansas -- tragedies that befell admired
young high school celebrities. He stirred up resentment when the locals recognized the
original cases. Picnic has dramatic teeth because we know that Flo Owens, the
abandoned mother, is almost certainly correct in trying to stop her daughter from
leaving: Hal and Madge's passion will almost certainly collapse in poverty, gambling, or
liquor. That's apparently what happened in real life. But Madge resolves to take her
chances with the cards she's dealt. Inge gives his most hopeful thoughts to the sweet
lady next door, Helen Potts (Verna Felton). She's an elderly woman taking care of an even
older mother, and locked away from opportunities of life and love. Helen gives Madge her
unspoken blessing -- she knows that a woman must follow her heart, one way or another.
Sony's DVD of Picnic is an improvement on their earlier widescreen disc, with
softer colors and less grain. Some fading has occurred but the digital restoration is
remarkably effective.
The second film in the Kim Novak Collection Jeanne Eagels is reviewed here.
Pal Joey is another George Sidney effort adapted from the 1940 Broadway musical
that had made Gene Kelly a star. Pushed and pulled out of shape to accommodate the
requirements of its stellar cast -- especially Frank Sinatra -- Pal Joey  has its
own glossy appeal. Originally a womanizing heel who uses both a socialite and
stenographer as a path to getting his own nightclub, Joey has been transformed into a
more sympathetic Frank Sinatra clone. Although much of the bite of John O'Hara's original
has been left behind, the film offers Sinatra singing more Rodgers and Hart standards
(The Lady is a Tramp). The colorful, classy cinematography is a treat -- many
shots look as though they could be Sinatra album covers from the period. Some Sinatra
fans consider this his best film role.
Besides making Joey a nice guy, the adaptation reinvents socialite Vera Simpson (Rita
Hayworth) as an ex-burlesque queen. Showgirl Linda English (Kim Novak) tempts Joey in a
scene that's at least verbally sexy. Everybody gets to sing and dance although
Novak's singing voice is dubbed. With a couple of characters dropped and an entire
blackmail scheme eliminated, Pal Joey  becomes a Sinatra star vehicle plain and
simple. Among the supporting players, Barbara Nichols has some nice moments as another
showgirl.
This new transfer is much nicer than grainy Sony disc from about ten years ago. Colors
pop quite beautifully, giving Novak's close-ups an almost hallucinogenic quality.
Although Rita Hayworth has more depth as an actress, Novak's youth has the edge in the
glamour department.
The Stephen Rebello-hosted extras really hit their stride for Pal Joey . The
discussion starts off with Jean Louis' gowns -- Novak remembers taking a big interest in
her clothing and participating in the design process. Rebello also solicits comments on
Novak's preference against wearing bras. We then see quite a lot of Novak's beautiful
home on a river, and hear more about her happy life in an artist's colony. Her bedroom
features her own painted murals.
The select-scene commentary aligns nicely with its subject matter, with Novak discussing
her dubbed singing and the experience of working with Sinatra. She remembers a marked
change in Sinatra's attitude from The Man with the Golden Arm. Novak explains that
her complicated dance number with Hayworth was ruined when Frank arrived and cut out
moves and bits he didn't like or didn't want to learn. In the finished film, the number
is pretty ragged.
1958's Bell, Book and Candle re-teams the stars of Hitchcock'sVertigo in a
quirky romantic comedy that plays like a do-over to allow Kim Novak and James Stewart a
happier finish. Beautiful, mysterious art gallery proprietress Gil Holroyd (Novak) is
actually a practicing witch. She resorts to a love charm to attract Shep Henderson (James
Stewart), prying him away from his icky fianceé Merle (Janice Rule, wonderful in
the thankless role). Less like Burn Witch, Burn and more like TV's
Bewitched, witchcraft here is an apparently non-Satanic lifestyle. Gil's Aunt
Queenie (Elsa Lanchester) and her own brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon are a happy-go-lucky
Greenwich Village practioners that limit their magic to petty ends -- Nicky can't find a
good job. Nicky foolishly helps phony occult writer Sidney Redlitch (Ernie Kovacs) learn
about real witchcraft, which threatens to expose all of them.
Of course, romantic problems arise when Gil breaks the rules of witchcraft by falling in
love with her new 'enchanted' boyfriend, and regrets not winning him the honest way. This
is of course foolish, as any breathing man would crawl through fire for a date with Gil,
who is a knockout in her glamorous hip-chick costumes.
Kim Novak takes to the barefoot Bohemian style quite well, even with a pair of painted
eyebrows that look more like giant commas come to roost. Stewart exercises his comedy
skills without resorting to Harvey- type slapstick. His late night snuggling
scenes with Novak equate romantic infatuation with magical enchantment. Gil and Shep
indeed make a very attractive couple, and the picture works. Hermoine Gingold adds spice
playing an even more adept spell-caster than Novak's Gil.
In the accompanying featurette Kim Novak sticks to standard praise to talk about her
co-stars Lemmon and Kovacs but assures us that she recognized a fellow 'real person' in
James Stewart, a man as comfortable "as a pair of old slippers". Novak also cops to
loving the witchcraft angle -- she obviously delighted in working with Gil's 'familiar',
a Siamese cat named Pywacket.
1959's Middle of the Night is a heavy but rewarding drama from Paddy Chayefsky,
who adapts his own play. Set in a somewhat depressing vision of the New York garment
district, the show is about aging widower Jerry Kingsley (Fredric March) and his unstable
relationship with the young Betty Preisser, his secretary (Novak). Betty is divorced from
George, a musician (Lee Phillips) and has trouble making decisions. Her planned marriage
to Jerry meets plenty of resistance from her mother (Glenda Farrell) and she sometimes
feels like getting back together with George. Meanwhile, Jerry takes flak from his bossy
older sister and his married daughter Lillian (Joan Copeland), who makes life difficult
for her own husband (Martin Balsam) as well. Providing a negative role model is fellow
garment worker Lachman (Albert Dekker) a boastful but unhappy womanizer. Does Jerry and
Betty's romance have a chance?
Middle of the Night looks at a Marty- like situation from a different
angle, with two well-meaning and emotionally needy people negotiating a minefield of
disapproval and self-doubt. It doesn't take much to change their mood from infatuation to
suspicion. Both feel like losers in love and neither wants to be hurt again. But all
relationships are fraught with risk, and Jerry and Betty feel a strong attraction across
the May-December gulf.
Once again Paddy Chayefsky's flair for the natural flow of dialogue pulls us deeper into
the drama. Jerry's pride is too easily hurt and Betty is woefully insecure. The depth of
her weakness becomes clear when the smooth-talking George shows up one evening and too
easily talks his way back into her bed. The show looks at adult relationships in an adult
context, and comes out a winner. This is one of Novak's finest films.
Middle of the Night benefits from the presence of quality actors like Glenda
Farrell and Lee Grant. Young Jan Norris also makes a big impression as Betty's precocious
younger sister -- as she did a year or two later as one of Natalie Wood's girlfriends in
Splendor in the Grass.
On the set's final featurette Ms. Novak talks at length about her rewarding experience on
Middle of the Night, despite the fact that it didn't do well at the box office.
It's her most accomplished acting part and she's perfect for it. Betty is a mess of
contradictions; Kim describes her as a "baby" hungry for intimacy and a father figure.
Novak tells us that the telling blocking in one scene, where Jerry handles a dress dummy
as if it were Betty's body, was her idea. She also says that March had to be repeatedly
reminded to respect her 'personal boundaries'!
The Kim Novak Film Collection makes us grateful that Sony is currently doing such
a fine job with its library titles, when several other studios have more or less
abandoned classic movies. The transfers are all exceptionally good and widescreen
enhanced. The color films range from the candy-hues of Pal Joey to the softer
palette of Picnic, while the stylized B&W work in Jeanne Eagels contrasts
strongly with Middle of the Night's documentary look. Picnic and Pal
Joey have 5.1 tracks, which may be original mixes.
Added value producer Greg Carson has scored a coup with Kim Novak's participation, and
author Stephen Rebello (Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho) delivers an
exemplary interview portrait of this legendary shrinking violet. Ms. Novak's attitude
about her own fame is very interesting. She understands the point of view of Marlene
Dietrich, who worked into her seventies and then retreated forever away from cameras that
would mar her near-mystical image of glamour. Kim Novak liked her Hollywood work but
loves her privacy and creative life more. Her interviews convince us that she's happy
with the way things worked out. She sees no need to appear on camera in close-up. For the
many among us who have been enamored of her for half a century, her comments and
confidences here are more than enough reward.

The Kim Novak Collection - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT & JEANNE EAGELS Highlight THE KIM NOVAK COLLECTION on DVD
Sony remasters its top Kim Novak gems for this nicely appointed disc set, a collection
graced with the presence of the legendary actress herself. This is indeed a unique
occasion, as the wisely privacy-minded Ms. Novak has made very few personal appearances
since retiring from the screen. We've known her only through her glamorous film roles and
not through a publicity smokescreen or a history of self-promotion. The result is that
the captivating star of great pictures like Vertigo still retains the power to
fire our imaginations. A potent 1950s sex symbol, Novak is a class act all the way.
The movies in Sony's The Kim Novak Film Collection take her appeal in four
different directions. Picnic gives Novak her most iconic role. Madge Owens is the
Kansas high school prom queen desperate to escape her identity as the 'local beauty'.
Madge's mother Flo (Betty Field) wants to hurry her marriage to the local rich kid Alan
Benson (Cliff Robertson), but Madge unconsciously envies her brighter, less dazzling
sister Millie (Susan Strasberg), who hates small town life and wants to run away to New
York to "write books to shock everybody". Meanwhile, the spinster schoolteacher Rosemary
(Rosalind Russell) is living another female nightmare -- well into middle age, she's
desperate to marry the local merchant Howard Bevans (Arthur O'Connell).
The catalyst arrives in the form of Hal Carter (William Holden), a former college buddy
of Alan's who tells spicy tales of bumming around Hollywood and wants to beg Alan's dad
for a job. Hal talks big but can't hide the fact that he's a bum and will have to start
as a laborer. That doesn't decrease his appeal to Madge, much to the horror of her
mother. Hal's virility also upsets Rosemary, who causes a scene at the grand Labor Day
picnic that gets them all into trouble. The film's classic scene is an almost magical
evening dance at the picnic. Hal and Madge suddenly know that they're fated for each
other, in a relationship with little hope for a future.
Made on location at great expense, Picnic is an exceptional Columbia film.
Cinematographer James Wong Howe's warm, diffuse colors give the show a special look for
its year (1955), transforming the harvest picnic into a painfully poignant ritual for
those in desperate need to change their lives. Director Joshua Logan handles the actors
extremely well, and the camera blocking is worked out to perfection. The superb dialogue
by William Inge, the original author of the Broadway play, gives William Holden a
terrific opportunity to show how appealing he can be as a tough-guy loser. We soon forget
that Holden is at least ten years too old to play Hal. Kim Novak's part seems almost
autobiographical -- the deceptively "shallow" girl weary of being told she's beautiful.
It's said that Inge adapted Picnic and Splendor in the Grass from

Trivia
Columbia Pictures wanted to promote Rosalind Russell for an Academy Award nomination, but the actress refused to be placed in the "best supporting" category. Many felt she would have won had she cooperated.
'Holden, William' had to shave his chest for his role as it was considered too risque for those times.
Kim Novak's character Madge was originated on Broadway by actress Janice Rule.
In 1957, a marketing investigator, James Vicary, announced that for six weeks he had included subliminal messages in showings of the movie "Picnic." The messages supposedly said: "Eat Popcorn, Drink Coca-Cola." According to Vicary, the sales of this products increased from 18 to 57%. Even though his experiment led him to fame, Vicary never gave details of how he realized the experiment; and admitted in a later interview that everything was just a marketing trick.
The last shot is apparently the first use of a helicopter shot in a feature movie. It was filmed by Haskell Wexler, who was - at that time - James Wong Howe's assistant.
Notes
William Inge's play Picnic was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and Drama Critics Award in June 1953. The Broadway production starred Ralph Meeker as "Hal," Janice Rule as "Madge", Paul Newman as "Alan" and Kim Stanley as "Millie." Arthur O'Connell ("Howard") was the only actor from the original play to recreate his role for the movie. According to information in the file on the film in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library, both Paramount and 20th Century-Fox studios expressed interest in producing Inge's play, but were concerned about problems with the play's frank sexual content. According to news items, Columbia purchased the play in September 1953 for between $300,000 and $400,000. After submitting a script to the PCA in November 1954, the studio was cautioned to cut all suggestion that "Hal" and "Madge" had improper relations after the picnic. In the film it remains somewhat ambiguous as to whether Madge and Hal had slept together or not.
The provocative dance scene between Hal and Madge during the picnic went on to become an iconographic film moment. A modern biography on William Holden indicates the actor was very uneasy about the scene because of his limited dancing skills. The original music from the film was a great popular success and resulted in RCA Victor releasing the theme song as a radio single. Kim Novak appeared in the film as a redhead, a departure from her signature platinum blonde style.
In an oral history at the AMPAS Library, screenwriter Daniel Taradash indicates that Columbia studio head Harry Cohn offered him the opportunity to direct Picnic in exchange for writing the script. However, Joshua Logan, who also directed Picnic onstage, was given the job. Although Logan had years of theater direction experience, he had previously co-directed only one film, United Artists 1938 release, I Met My Love Again. Logan demanded that the play be rewritten to alter its unhappy ending of Hal and Madge not getting together, despite acknowledging that ending was probably more realistic. The film was shot on location near Kansas City, MO. Although the 1956 Paramount release Vagabond King (see below) was filmed first, Picnic was released first and thereby marked the feature film debut of actress Phyllis Newman.
Picnic won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction and Best Editing. The picture also received Academy Award nominations for Best Motion Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Arthur O'Connell), Best Direction and Best Music. In 1986 Gregory Harrison and Jennifer Jason Leigh appeared in a television adaptation of Inge's play broadcast on the Showtime cable network. In 2000, Josh Brolin and Gretchen Mol co-starred in a CBS television broadcast of Picnic.
