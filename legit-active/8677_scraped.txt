I'm on a mission to solve the world's biggest problem
People don't #Believe in themselves enough. The way to accomplish it is content at scale, so I share my story, highlight wisdom from the legends, and train thought leaders on how to get their message out to the world. Your story can change people's lives... but only if they hear it.

In one full year of my first video being up, only three people left a comment: my mom, my older sister, and some random guy who found my video. Three comments in one year. See, I'm an introvert. I didn't go on YouTube to be famous. I did it to try to help. But it took me a long time to get comfortable in front of the camera. I was nervous, shy, and disappointed with everything I made.And then I met my now-business manager, Steve. He's a hardcore New York guy who helped build people like Mel Robbins and Grant Cardone into brands. In the first 6 years without him I went from 0 to 9,000 subscribers. Over the next 6 years with him I went from 9,000 to over 2 million subscribers.
Without a mentor or model, I failed. With them, I succeeded.

HRH Princess Francisca Harakawa (Amasu Omawa III)
"In today’s society, there are few scholars whose wisdom transcends age, gender, ethnicity, occupation and status. Sir Jonathan is one such scholar. He has guided me through many challenges over the years and has done the same for many others around the world. He is one of only a handful of people whom I trust and can turn to for guidance, and I am truly grateful to know him as a friend and teacher."
Richard Buettner
"As Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem Knights of Malta, it has been my mission to uphold our knightly tradition of promoting excellence, decency and altruism throughout the world. Sir Jonathan Amaret is one such individual who exemplifies this tradition with his tireless efforts to improve the lives of others through the school of Thought Mechanics and we are pleased with his induction into our order."

"I’m so happy to have met Jonathan at that time when I was €5000 in debt about 2 years and 4 months ago.He helped me clear my mind to focus on what I want, blocking out my doubts and helping my to control my fears.
I went on to use these techniques to achieve my first success. Got personally mentored by him right before I hit 6 figures. And continued to follow his guidance and teachings when I broke through to multiple 6 figures because it enabled me to hit a 7 figure income this year and use that knowledge to help hundreds of people to achieve the same level of success. Most importantly Jonathan helped me balance out between the good & bad to get exactly where I wanted to go. Thank you Jonathan for everything that you do for the countless people on this planet."
