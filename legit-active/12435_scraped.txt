50 Classic Russian Films (Including Tarkovsky’s Finest) Now Online
in Film |   	May 5th, 2011  3 Comments
We have pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured films by the great Russ­ian film­mak­er Andrei Tarkovsky. So we’re over­joyed to report that the Moscow film com­pa­ny Mos­film has just made 5o Russ­ian clas­sics avail­able on YouTube in high def­i­n­i­tion. Accord­ing to Yahoo News, Mos­film has pledged to release five more films each week, all in HD with Eng­lish sub­ti­tles, even­tu­al­ly bring­ing the total for the year to 200.
You can look over the whole list of cur­rent­ly avail­able clas­sics at Mos­film’s YouTube chan­nel. (Non-Russ­ian speak­ers might want to hit Google Trans­late.) In yet anoth­er con­ces­sion to the deca­dence of West­ern cap­i­tal­ism, each film is pre­ced­ed by a short com­mer­cial. We hope some bal­ance has been restored to the uni­verse by the inclu­sion of com­mu­nist dic­ta­tor Joseph Stal­in’s favorite movie, the musi­cal com­e­dy Vol­ga Vol­ga.
Don’t miss our big col­lec­tion, 4,000+ Free Movies Online: Great Clas­sics, Indies, Noir, West­erns, Doc­u­men­taries & More.

Although this is unde­ni­ably great, none of the films appear to be avail­able in HD, as you say. The 360p res­o­lu­tion on youtube is notice­ably dif­fer­ent than what you would see on a DVD.  I rec­om­mend that any­one inter­est­ed in these great films seek out the DVDs (or Blu-ray in the case of Solaris). Its worth it.

Is it pos­si­ble to watch “The Broth­ers Kara­ma­zov” online. And can they be with Eng­lish sub­ti­tles, per­haps?
