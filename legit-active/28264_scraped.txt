Red Sox Rumors: Opening Day Roster Decision Made On Top Prospect

Wayne Gretzky is very proud of his son Trevor Gretzky, . According to ESPN.com, the elder Gretzky is also happy that his son is headed into baseball as opposed to hockey.
“So when he chose baseball at a young age, I’m a huge baseball fan and I loved going to his games and watching baseball. And being in California, that’s what kids should be playing — baseball,” Gretzky said on ESPN 1000’s The Waddle & Silvy Show.
Gretzky added that his son does not need the added pressure of playing hockey and having to deal with constant comparisons to his father.
The younger Gretzky was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the seventh round of this year’s MLB draft. Gretzky, who is slated to meet with the Cubs next week, has not yet decided if he will be joining the Cubs orginization or playing at San Diego State in the coming year.
“Right now he’s more excited about the Cubs scenario because that’s a little bit more fresh in his mind, and he’s a typical 18-year-old,” Wayne Gretzky said. “But San Diego State and Tony Gwynn have been great to him all season long, and I know he likes their school and organization.”
