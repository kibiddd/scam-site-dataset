Critics Consensus
The stories the soldiers have to tell are eye-opening and wrenching to hear; collectively it's a searing peek into the toll of war both during and after.

Mostly a string of talking-head interviews, but those talking heads -- more than 16 men and women -- are compelling.

Behind The Lens
[A]lthough completely one-sided, THE GROUND TRUTH does fill that need and does expose some of that truth. At the very least, THE GROUND TRUTH hits the ground running. Now it's up to the rest of us to help carry the ball.

It leaves you in no doubt of the psychological cost of war.

Hard-hitting, uncompromising, thought-provoking, moving...those are just a few adjectives that describe this documentary about veterans from the Iraq War.

This is a hard film to watch, but it is an important film to watch. It's a documentary about military folks who served in the Iraqi War from their recruitment, to training, to serving (and killing), and coming home with both psychic and physical wounds. It is them, their voices, their pain, their forever changed lives. One likens recruitment to marketing of cigarettes: it used to be cool (Marlboro Man billboards) and now comes with a surgeon general's warning. The surgeon general doesn't warn anyone about how cool it is to become a Marine. Another talks about his field chaplain: The human body can live 72 hours without water, two weeks without food, and no time at all without hope.
