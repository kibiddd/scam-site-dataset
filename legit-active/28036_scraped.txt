Pennsylvania Highways:  Interstate 84
Fallen Trooper Memorial Highway
Originally, this Interstate was to traverse
extreme northern Pennsylvania from Erie to Scranton along the US 6 alignment
when the initial Interstate routings were published on August 14, 1957.  On
June 27, 1958, the Bureau of Public Roads changed the route of the Interstate because of
a change in the routing of Interstate 80 across the
Commonwealth.
The 1964 Department of Highways map
was the first time the public would see the path of future Interstate 84.  Its
gray, dashed line stretching from Interstate 81 in Moosic to the New York state
line over the Delaware River in Matamoras.  The Department of Highways
would start changing that gray dashed line into a green dashed line as
construction began in Pike County between Spring Road west of Lords Valley to
Sawkill Road in 1967.  The following year, construction was extended
westward to Beaver Dam Road just east of PA 507 and eastward to Palmer Road
northeast of Milford.With progress taking place in Pike County,
news was just as good in Lackawanna on future work.  State Highways Secretary
Robert G. Bartlett was notified on April 15, 1969 and confirmed the following
day that the US Department of
Transportation had chosen the so-called "northern route" over two
other proposals to link Interstate 81 to Interstate 81E over the Moosic
Mountains.  The one proposal called for a connection near the Elmhurst
Reservoir and the other for a connection at Moosic.  The Department of
Highways had advocated for the northern route, with state highways officials
feeling that alignment would "serve the most people and injure the
fewest."  Thomas Harrington, Scranton District engineer for the
Department of Highways was also pleased with the decision.

The US Department of Transportation
decision was made even with protests by a number of local groups such as the Greater
Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Commerce, with the support of US Representative Daniel
Flood, which demanded the connection be made at Moosic.  According to
federal officials, the Moosic connection would cost far more than the $18.7
million estimate for construction of the connection near Elmhurst.  It was
estimated that construction of the proposed link had been delayed by about two
years due to the Luzerne County protests against the northern route plan.
The plan for a connection near the Elmhurst Reservoir was cancelled with respect
to the Pennsylvania Water & Gas Company which warned that the project could
pollute the reservoir.
Construction continued in 1969 as work
was extended eastward to the first exit inside New York and westward to just
west of the PA 191 interchange.
The first section of Interstate 84 to
open would be the bridge spanning the Delaware River in 1970, while it would be
two more years until a section of Interstate on land would open.  In 1972,
the section from Exit 26 to Exit 53 opened to traffic.  That same year, it was determined that the Moosic Mountains would
prove to be an engineering challenge, and require an alteration in the proposed
alignment.  The Department of Highways moved the western terminus north on
Interstate 81 to its current location, creating a multiplex with the new
Interstate 380 which was signed to replace Interstate 81E.  Construction on an Interstate-grade highway had
begun in 1960 and finished in 1961 between
Interstate 81 and Tigue Street.
In 1973, work was extended west for a second time to Aberdeen Road southwest of
Drinker.  Also in that year, the section from Exit 1 to Exit 2 was upgraded
to Interstate standards.  In 1974, work was extended westward a third time to Exit 8 while
another section opened to traffic from Exit 17 to Exit 26.  Construction
began on the massive Directional T interchange between Interstate 84 and Interstate 380 in
1975, which also included a section to the PA 435 overpass.  In 1976, the
section between Exit 8 and Exit 17 opened while construction began on the
section from the PA 435 overpass to Exit 8.
As the Interstate opened piece by piece,
PennDOT decided to mark the exits using mileage-based exit numbers beginning in
1975.  A mere two years later, they were switched to sequential
numbering.  Mileage-based exit numbers would reappear on Interstate 84 in
2001.
Finally, the last section to open between
Interstate 380 and Exit 8 occurred in 1978.
During the 1990s, most of Interstate 84 was
rebuilt with the last part the interchange at Interstate
81.  This was occurring as the Lackawanna Valley Industrial Highway,
now known as the Robert P. Casey Highway, was being connected at the same
interchange.  This massive newly-reconfigured interchange opened in October 1999.
We all know why the chicken crossed the
road, and it seems at least 250 of them knew as well on the morning of September
6, 2012.  State Police and PennDOT were sent out to a section in Dunmore
after receiving calls from drivers who spotted chickens running free and more
than a dozen crates filled with chickens on the side of the Interstate.  No
one knows how the chickens got there, but it was more than likely a truck
hauling chickens that somehow lost its load without the driver knowing.
The Interstate was not closed because the chickens were resting off to the side
of the travel lanes.  PennDOT workers gathered and delivered them to the
Griffin Animal Pond Shelter.
A major rebuilding project began on
October 29, 2013 between Exit 46 and the New York state line.  Initial work
entailed building crossovers to move traffic from the westbound lanes to the
eastbound lanes and in Spring 2014, the rehabilitating work will begin.
The project will include replacing the eastbound and westbound lanes,
rehabilitating seven bridges, building a new bridge, rehabilitating five
culverts, retaining wall, sanitary sewer work, new guiderail, drainage, and
pavement markings.  Work cost $66.4 million and finished in April 2016.  The primary need for this is the ongoing failure of the
existing pavement due to alkali silica reactivity (ASR).  ASR causes the
pavement to deteriorate due to a reaction between the aggregate and cement that
was used in the early 1970s during construction.  The concrete can form a
gel that may absorb water which expands and cracks the concrete.
On the night of October 22, 2019, a
hole was discovered to have opened up on the eastbound bridge over Shiny
Mountain Road in Pike County.  This prompted PennDOT to close the
Interstate between Exit 20 and Exit 26 until repairs could be made.
When the Coronavirus, or COVID-19,
pandemic swept into the country in March 2020, PennDOT took measures to stem the
spread to their employees and staff.  At 12:01 AM on March 17, all rest
areas and welcome centers across the state, including the ones in Pike County,
were closed to the traveling public.  Also all Driver License and Photo
License centers were closed for two weeks and construction projects on roads
under the Department of Transportation's jurisdiction were stopped.
Hearing that construction work was halted could come as welcome news, the idea
of closing down the rest areas did not sit well with truckers, trucking firms,
nor some elected officials.  It was then announced that on Thursday, March
19, barricades would come down at 13 rest areas across the state and they would be reopened with
portable restroom facilities while the permanent facilities would remain closed.
"Every decision made has been in the interest of mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 and we are constantly reevaluating our response," said PennDOT
spokeswoman Alexis Campbell.  "That said, we also recognize that
drivers need and deserve access to rest areas."  PennDOT announced on
March 24 that an additional 10 would reopen, including the ones in Pike County.
Those as well as the ones reopened earlier would provide normal service with
additional cleaning and maintenance.
This Interstate has a twin on the other
side of the country which runs between Portland, Oregon and Echo, Utah.
