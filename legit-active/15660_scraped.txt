A huge loss. Canada needed him. We needed him. And we loved him.

Even with passing away at only 61, his life achieved 100 years’ worth of greatness.  R.I.P., Jack.

Very sad news. What a terrible disease. I was never a supporter of Jack Layton, politically, but I was really hoping he’d pull through this cancer. Seeing the images of him when he stepped aside was gut wrenching. I wanted to see him looking the way he did before, impossible as it seemed.  This is a great loss.

It seems that that times like these words seem superfluous and meaningless. Jack Layton lived his life to the fullest and he never gave up on his dreams even through his battle wit cancer and this should be an inspiration to all of us. My sincere sympathies to his wife and family and I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers. May God keep you safe in his hands.  All I can offer at this time is a poem I wrote for a friend of mine and it seems so well suited for Mr Layton, to me, I think he might have spoken these word had he been able to.
Dear Lord
You gave to me
Along my life long travels
Days filled with sunshine
Cloudy days even stormy days
As I stand here before You
As my life is ending
I want to thank you, O Lord,
For the numbered years You have given me
For the joy that filled my days
Time went by too fast
All too fast
And I know that You are calling me to You.
As I stand before You My Lord
I want to thank You for the happiness
I have had with my family
Thank You Dear Lord
For the chance at meeting so many friends
Touching their lives
And loving them all
I know that as I walk to You
For a new beginning
You will take care of the people I love
Keeping them all safely in the hollow of Your hand
Making sure that their tears
Are tears of happiness for me
For even if I leave them behind
I take them with me in my heart
Amen
And we, who are left behind
Will carry him in our heart and soul
And we will always remember the moment
He was born in eternity

I am pretty sure Layton was an atheist, so your pleas to an unseen magical power ring a little hollow.

Jack Layton was an aetheist you dummy.  Godless in the extreme.  And trust me, he was no loss to democracy — unless you consider a spendthrift, fiscally irresponsible (i.e., NDP), same-sex-supporting, 4th rate politician to have any value.

What’s with the recycled (lousy, religious) poem?  Doesn’t the Honourable, Superior, Godlike Jack Layton deserve his own original work of religious pap?

Poor Olivia; she clearly adored him, through thick and thin, which was nice to see, after over 20 years of marriage. I hope she finds the strength to carry on their work, and will find future happiness.

What a shock – as I am in Dubai now – I did not hear about it until yesterday afternoon.
RIP Jack Layton and my condolences to Olivia and his family

Just came back from the cottage in Marmora and just found out.
So sad.  Everyone is sad.  Even if you didn’t agree with him I think he managed to touch us and inspire us all.
