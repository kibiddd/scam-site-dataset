In 2005 Tee took MOREVI into the then-unknown podosphere, making his novel the first book podcast in its entirety. That experience led to the founding of Podiobooks.com and collaborating with Evo Terra and Chuck Tomasi on Podcasting for Dummies and its follow-up, Expert Podcasting Practices for Dummies. He won acclaim and accolades for his cross-genre fantasy-detective Billibub Baddings Mysteries, the podcast of The Case of the Singing Sword winning him the 2008 Parsec Award for Best Audio Drama. Along with those titles, Tee has written articles and short stories for BenBella Books's Farscape Forever: Sex, Drugs, and Killer Muppets, the podcast anthology VOICES: New Media Fiction, BenBella Books' So Say We All: Collected Thoughts and Opinions of Battlestar Galactica, and Dragon Moon Press' Podthology: The Pod Complex.
When he is not writing, Tee enjoys life in Virginia alongside Philippa Ballantine, his daughter, and five cats (3 female, 2 males). Considering the male-to-female ratio in his house, Tee understands how General Custer felt near his end.Read moreRelated authorsSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextMadeleine Holly-RosingJaime BuckleyKristine Kathryn RuschSteve MillerChuck TomasiReviews for Expert Podcasting Practices For DummiesRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/51 rating0 reviewsWhat did you think?Rate as 1 out of 5, 1 stars.
