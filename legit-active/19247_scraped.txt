Search Tips
Using various search tips can be very helpful if you’re looking for information about someone, but don’t have all the necessary details. These tips can help you find the person you’re looking for even if you don’t have any exact information on them.
Previous Home Address
If you only have an address and not a name, you can search for contact information using Radaris to locate the person or people associated with that address. Our Reverse Address Lookup is effective even if the data is outdated. Even if a person has not lived at a particular address for years, or the associated phone number is no longer active, that data can still yield traces.
Use Reverse Phone Lookup
Radaris provides a free tool for reverse phone number lookup that can help you retrieve the phone owner's complete name, address, and other details on persons. Whether you missed a call, received an unexpected text from an unknown number, or are expecting a call from an unfamiliar number, Radaris can assist you in quickly identifying the caller via reverse phone number search.
Extend Your People Search
Extend your people search by trying out variations of the name and cross reference the individual across other matching parameters, such as age, region, and others. To make sure your people search encompasses as many social media platforms as possible, resort to the Radaris people finder to get precise results instantly.
Try Other Options
You can try to get some information and then use Radaris to get complete information about the person or people in question. If you need information on a particular person, people, or topic, you can resort to numerous reputable sources that are accessible online, such as government websites, academic journals, and news outlets.
Different Variations of Name
When searching for a childhood friend whose complete name you're not sure about anymore, try to search different variations of the name. Should this approach fail, contact the Radaris customer service to help you in your people or reverse phone search, or call us at 855-723-2747
Search for Relatives
If you have limited information about the people you are searching for, you can try to search for their family members on Radaris. This can provide you with information that may lead you to the person you are trying to locate.
Control Your Info
A privacy monitor assistant is an effective online tool that helps you search for your personal information on the web. That includes your phone number, address, email, country of residence, date of birth, marital status, and more. The information is legally available on public databases for free or for sale through data brokers.
When you click the Radaris privacy monitoring tool, we scan the information available in popular data broker platforms looking for your personal information. On Radaris, we offer an option to remove publicly available information.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is people search by Radaris free?
Yes, anyone may now use the Radaris people search engine for free. You may, however, choose to buy a report that includes a wealth of extra information about the individual you’re looking for. If you’re performing in-depth research and need to know everything possible about someone, we recommend getting a full Background Report.
Can I manage my data or even remove it from Radaris?
Yes, you certainly can. Data management and removal requires our proprietary information control tool. Please locate the “Control Your Info” button and follow the on-screen instructions.
What makes Radaris different from other people search engines?
Millions of free public records. When you run a search on Radaris, the first thing you will see is the most recent results of our own web search organized into convenient profiles. Radaris frequently and carefully monitors the internet for new public records. When you use Radaris, you can be sure that you’re getting the most up-to-date and accurate information available (however, with millions of new people and new records being created every day, we do make mistakes).
How do you get the information about people that you provide on Radaris? Is this legal?
Yes, it is 100% legal. We purchase expensive public datasets from official sources, then analyze and integrate them, and continuously look for open data sources to improve our records as much as possible. Then you see the result: a lightning-fast people search with all of the background information in one place for your convenience.
How can I find someone when I have very little information?
If you only have a little information, start with the Radaris search feature that fits best with what you already know about them. This could be a reverse address lookup, reverse phone lookup, email address, or business background check. Plus, since Radaris has a vast database going back more than 20 years, your starting information does not have to be current. We can connect whatever you have to the latest records and give you the current information that you need.
How can I find a person by name?
Let’s say you’re looking for your date and only know his or her «nickname» first name, but not their full first name. In that situation, you might experiment with other name combinations that you believe are possible. This usually helps. If it doesn’t, call Radaris customer service for help and they will run test searches to find the right person.
How do I find the name of someone at a certain address?
You can use the Radaris reverse address lookup. Simply enter the address and Radaris will return the entire history of the property. Radaris provides you with easy access to many unique records and comprehensive background check information. The platform offers an extensive database with billions of entries for people to search.
Is it possible to find a person’s name with only their phone number?
Yes, you can use the Radaris reverse phone number lookup tool to find the owner of any phone number. You can receive the phone owner’s full name, address, and more by using this free lookup service. Radaris will aid you in quickly detecting the caller’s real name whether you missed a call, received a text message from an unknown number, or don’t recognize an incoming call. Anyone can use Radaris to perform a free reverse phone lookup to locate a mobile, cellphone, private, or business phone number.
Why should I choose Radaris?
Our public records search for names, addresses, phone numbers, property history, civil and criminal records is one of the most thorough on the market, and it is continually updated with new information. Unlike our rivals, we attempt to deliver as much free data as possible, so you can permanently save money with Radaris. If something goes wrong (which is unusual), our customer service is always ready to help you find the information you need.
Since its inception as a social network in 2006, the Radaris platform has evolved into a fast and powerful reverse address search engine. It’s also an excellent tool for looking for old friends, new neighbors, property records, and fraudulent phone numbers.
Since 2010, when the search engine functionality was enabled, the company has gathered public data. The site delivers a detailed report when you pay for a monthly data plan subscription. While a free version is available, it has limited information availability. The site also offers a geo grouping tool that allows users to easily combine search results based on their location.
