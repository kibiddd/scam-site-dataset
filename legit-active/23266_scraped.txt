Ryan MeagherSounds like “Marr”Portland-based jazz guitarist, composer, and educator.Jazz Journal called him, “the most interesting new guitarist on the scene since Pat Metheny.” JazzTimes remarked that his music was “startingly original stuff.” Downbeat Magazine noted that, “there’s a strong element of folksong in Meagher’s compositions, expressed by his singing melodies and commitment to the gravity and beauty of a balanced lyrical arc.”He is the Jazz Director at Lower Columbia College in Longview, Washington. He also holds teaching appointments at the University of Portland, Mt. Hood Community College, Willamette University, as well as a private studio. Previous teaching appointments include San Diego State University, West Valley College, Portland Community College, and was the jazz director at Metropolitan Youth Symphony for six years.
