He has been married to Tanya Frost since July 11, 1987. They have three children.FamilySpouseTanya Frost(July 11, 1987 - present) (3 children)TriviaDuring his career at IU, his hair was often motionless even during
games. This led to accusations that he wore hair spray, which he
denied.Often cites Jame 1:12 as his favorite Bible verse: "Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised for those who love him.".Though his Indiana University coach, Bobby Knight, often criticized Alford's defense, Alford set a National Invitation Tournament record with eight steals in a game against Butler University in 1985.Led the NCAA in free throw shooting as a freshman, making 137 of 150
attempts (91.2%).Suspended for one game during his sophomore season at IU for posing for
a sorority calender that was produced to raise money for a specialized
camp for handicapped girls. He said he assumed incorrectly that posing
for the calender was within NCAA rules because it was for charity. NCAA
rules actually prohibited players from posing for pictures made outside
of their school's athletic department. The suspension caused Alford to
miss a game against arch-rival Kentucky, which his team lost 63-58. The
NCAA later modified its rules to allow players to participate in such
charitable promotions.5 moreAll
