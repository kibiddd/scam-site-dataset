I notice that the Air Transat/Thomas Cook flight from Vancouver to Manchester only lets you bring 5 kg to carry on luggage. Has anyone flown with them and can tell me if the airlines enforces the weight limitation?

Thomas Cook are very strict on luggage allowances and often your hand luggage will be weighed at check in. If they don't weigh it they usually ask you to show it to them so they can assess it's size and weight. Five kilos is the standard hand luggage allowance on UK charter airlines.

We will be on Thomas Cook flight in three weeks time.
Do they allow ladies hand bag or an extra camera backpack on top of the 5kg hand luggage allowance?

Are you joking? Of course they do. As long as you think laterally. Think jacket. With pockets. LOTS of pockets. No weight restrictions on that. "fill 'er up guv"
