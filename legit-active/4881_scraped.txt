Only EntryLevelCrossing consolidates every job it can find in the domain and puts all of the job listings it locates in one place.
We have more jobs than any other job board.
We list jobs you will not find elsewhere that are hidden in small regional publications and employer websites
We collect jobs from more than 4,429,376 websites and post them on our site.
We are private, and therefore far fewer people are applying for the jobs on our site than are applying for those on public job boards.

What I liked about the service is that it had such a comprehensive collection of jobs! I was using a number of sites previously and this took up so much time, but in joining EmploymentCrossing, I was able to stop going from site to site and was able to find everything I needed on EmploymentCrossing.
