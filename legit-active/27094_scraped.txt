Cacao
Cacao comes from the fermented seed from the fruit of the cocoa tree. It's what gives chocolate its decadent taste, although cacao itself isn't naturally sweet. It's believed the ancient Maya of Central America were the first people to consume cacao, which they called kakawa ("Food of the Gods"). A true pantry staple and a multitasker, cacao comes in powder, butter, and nibs form for you to make endless chocolate-perfect creations.
