Safe, fun and exciting
Mick22:32 13 Jul 24.A fantastic spot for a family stroll, this amazing property is home to many famous retirees of the racing world and abundant wildlife. As you walk, you'll enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. The charming homestead, with its open fire, offers delicious food and coffee, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. It's an ideal destination for a relaxing family day out, combining natural beauty and comfort. Highly recommended for anyone visiting the area.Fahd Ali14:34 13 Jul 24sako mako11:07 12 Jul 24This place is amazing and the people who working there are lovely,Ephraim Meyer10:09 07 Jul 24Raghavendra sp08:50 07 Jul 24Fun with kangaroosJojo K04:29 25 May 24Heaven on earth! Such an amazing place for these champions. Living their best lives thanks to all involved. The negative reviews about the coffee need to remember that it‚Äôs not a cafe and also that it‚Äôs very popular‚Ä¶coffee doesn‚Äôt come before horses and it‚Äôs busy because it‚Äôs beautiful! Nobody comes for the coffee‚Ä¶they come for the horses and they‚Äôre spectacular! I‚Äôll be a regular that‚Äôs for sure ‚ù§Ô∏èüêé 10/10 every time and the tour guide was so knowledgeable, Luke, you were perfect xKyle Wintaur12:40 13 May 24We visited on Mother‚Äôs Day, and while it was busy (as you would expect), it was still amazing. The Homestead food and coffee was great, the horses all seemed super happy and healthy, and there‚Äôs the added bonus of planes flying low overhead.Tony Jacobson Peace05:54 05 Mar 24Did not visit this location for the park itself. However, this location is great for plane enthusiasts. Great views from here of the runway. Toilets in the park were well maintained and were very clean. Will visit park again soon, but that time will be to explore the park and I will post again.Valerie King09:32 03 Jan 24Luke was an excellent tour guide with lots of information on these former champions. It was lovely to see them so loved and living the good life! The old homestead is of great interest in itself and also serves up a great coffee in beautiful surroundings! üíú
