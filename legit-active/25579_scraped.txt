Chester Brown
Posted on October 19, 2006 by Inkstuds
I was lucky enough to be able to take advantage of the fact that Chester Brown was on doing a tour across Canada to support the soft cover release of Louis Riel. Chester came into the studio to sit for an hour while Colin and I quized him with many questions about his body of work. Chester is by far one of Canadaâ€™s comix legends. His auto-bio works, I Never Liked You and Playboy, are both hallmarks of cartooning achievement at its best.
