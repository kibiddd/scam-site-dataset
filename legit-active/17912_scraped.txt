Well, I'd like to tell you
All about my dream, it's a place
Where strip malls abound
And diversion's mere moments away
Where culture's defined by the
Ones least refined
And you'll be left behind
If you don't fit in
It's all distorted
In Americana, my way
Well, fuck you
(Woa oo, woa oo, woa oo)
Well, my dream has come true
(Woa oo, woa oo, woa oo)
My vision has come true
Now give me my cable
Fast food, four by's that's right away
I want it right now
'Cause my g-g-generation don't like to wait
My future's determined
By thieves, thugs, and vermin
It's quite an excursion
But it's okay
Everything's backwards
In Americana, my way
Well, fuck you
(Woa oo, woa oo, woa oo)
Well, my dream has come true
(Woa oo, woa oo, woa oo)
My vision has come true
Yeah, all it's comin' true
I'm a product
Of my environment
So don't blame me
I just work here
But I wanna fuck you
My rights are denied
By those least qualified
Trading profit for pride
But it's, it's okay
Everything's backwards
In Americana, my way
Well, fuck you
(Woa oo, woa oo, woa oo)
My nightmare has come true
(Woa oo, woa oo, woa oo)
My nightmare has come true
Yeah, it's all comin' true
Yeah, it's all comin' true
