Paul Carpenter (December 8, 1921 – June 12, 1964) was a Canadian actor and singer.
Carpenter originally attended medical school in Montreal, but left aged 17 to join the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a war correspondent. He also played professional hockey in Canada.
He moved to England and sang with Ted Heath and His Music in the 1940s and starred in the BBC Radio serial "Riders of the Range" (1949–1953) as the cowboy Jeff Arnold, where he shared the billing with his dog, Rustler (played by Percy Edwards).
During rehearsals for a play at the Vaudeville Theatre in London, Carpenter was found dead in his dressing room. He had recently recovered from injuries suffered in a car accident.
