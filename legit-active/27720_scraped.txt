The Hilton Hhonor Priority lane was of no use because they were short of staff.  I asked the receptionist if the Executive Lounge is operational and that being Diamond if I can checked in there.  She was very helpful asking me to go to the lift while she will get a concierge to provide me excess to the Executive Club.  I got there and was relief to find Krystal being so helpful getting me my room.  While she process my stay I and my friend was invited to the Lounge to relax with a cup of freshly brew coffee.  I was upgraded to Executive King and offered with various benefits including breakfast, afternoon tea, social hour and complimentary 2 pieces laundry each day. Breakfast on the 4th floor has a wide good spread of food.  Amazing local delicacies saving me the time to go out on the street to hunt for such food.  For 4 days of breakfast Leo Fang and Zora Yu make my experience unforgettable.  They remembered the type of coffee and where my seat preference.  It is always good to have staffs like them who has the passion and dedication to their work.The property is located in the heart of the city merely 10 min or less by car to Railway station.  It is also very close to some touristic attraction.This is not my first stay and am glad I choose Hilton Xiamen for this travel.  Will not hesitate to consider this property on my next visit Xiamen.Read moreDate of stay: April 2021Trip type: Traveled on businessThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

BTW I am HH Diamond. First off, upon arrival I was offered an upgraded suite, early check in and late check out, W/O asking. (I never assume I am ENTITLED). Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. (My thought was that every Hilton in the US should do their training here; it was that good!) The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was great. Executive lounge decent. For local transport I used Didi and NEVER waited more than 2 minutes for a car, and very inexpensive! Foreigners like myself, can now use Alipay easily for Didi and paying in most shops. (Hint: As a tourist, If you want to go to Gulangyu you need to use the Cruise terminal...there is a lot of incorrect/conflicting info out there.) You also need to carry your Passport as it is needed for things like the Ferry.Read moreDate of stay: April 2024Trip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

After he agreed to made a few phone calls to verify our actual rate he finally agreed with the BPG rate but 20 mins had been wasted.2)The executive lounge is currently closed so all the diamond members and executive floor guests will be having the happy hour in the Chinese restaurant but because of the full occupancy of the Chinese restaurant all the diamond members and executive floor guests will be having complimentary buffet dinner at the western restaurant for the national day weekend. However, the AFOM Wang said that because of the room rate confusion he caused so he would go ahead to ‘upgrade’ our Hilton diamond happy hour to buffet dinner that is specially just for us. Instead of telling us the truth because of the full occupancy of the Chinese restaurant so we will have to have enjoy our diamond benefit at the western restaurant buffet, he used it and lied about it telling it was a special personal offer just for us. That is very dishonest of him so actually he offered us nothing to recover the bad service he caused.3)We are non smokers and were given the smallest room on the 15 floor and we asked about a ‘downgrade’ from executive room to premium room which has more space. Wang said no to us very rudely without checking. The 16 floor is the smoking floor and has a stair to connect to the non smoking 15 floor but because of the open air stair, we can smell the cigarette coming from the 16/F to the hall way and our room. Also we saw the room 1503 opened his room door to smoke and talk on the phone very loudly but this is a nonsmoking floor and the noise was very disturbing. I reported that to the hotel but I didn’t see they have taken any actions and housekeepers walked by this room normally like nothing happened.I reported all of those problem to the management team before check out but have not received any feedbacks from the hotel at all. It kind of shows that the hotel did not really care about customer service.Read moreDate of stay: October 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

However, after stepping out the elevator to the room, all is old and smelly.The swimming pool is horrible with lots of children without well management.The way to the swimming pool is quite dirty and some stuff there making a little bit of messy.Some staff are nice and polite, but some are rude. It may be the most terrible experience staying in Hilton.

I even called 2 days before our arrival to confirm this and was promised two non-smoking rooms. When we arrived, we were placed in two rooms on a smoking floor. The rooms smelled very strongly of tobacco. When we asked to change to non-smoking rooms they said that they had none available. After continued discussion throughout the day (we did nothing that day but try to get out of those rooms) we were finally moved to rooms on another floor (which still smelled like smoke but was a bit better) with two of our rooms further apart than we had requested initially and were promised that we would be moved to closer rooms the next day. When the new room became available, we realized that this room had been smoked in by the past guest, which the hotel confirmed, and were unable to move into this room. We messaged the sales manager (Rex) who we had been put in contact with and asked if he could do anything for us because of the hours of inconvenience that this had caused (one of the members of our party even fell ill as a result of sleeping in one of the rooms that smelled like smoke and we had to constantly pack up and move rooms). Rex replied that he had already given us VIP fruits and nothing else. After this we were able to contact Lynn, the front office manager, who was a real professional and arranged for us to be sent to the airport for free and allowed us to stay in our rooms on our last day for however long we wanted (which ended up being very helpful).Service aside, the hotel was just ok. The rooms were pretty dated but the executive lounge was very nice with good service and delicious food. Especially the egg tarts, the were the best that I have ever had in many years of egg tart eating.Read moreDate of stay: January 20191.0 of 5 bubblesValue2.0 of 5 bubblesRooms1.0 of 5 bubblesServiceTrip type: Traveled with familyThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

All our flight itineraries will be the same. We have booked 5 rooms at your hotel. My questions are regarding transportation to & from the airport on our arrival day and departure day.
