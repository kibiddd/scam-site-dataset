Jack Hudson and her parents, Charles and Alice Skidmore in Heaven. Joyce was born in Charlotte, North Carolina on September 27, 1924.  After graduation she married W. Jack Hudson. Soon after they were married they accepted the Lord as their Savior and gave their lives to His service. Joyce loved the Lord with all her heart and willingly devoted the next thirty-six years of her life to His calling to Northside Baptist Church. Joyce was a constant help mate to her husband while the church grew from the first service of 28 to over 5000 at their retirement. She supervised the Nursery Department of the church through the 36 years and not only knew all the babies but each had a special place in her heart as she watched them grow to adulthood and bring their own babies to the nursery. Northside remained a vital part of her life until her homegoing.  She is survived by her loving and grateful children and their spouses, Linda and Thomas Stinson, Patsy and Michael Carrigan and Mark and Denise Hudson all of Charlotte. She is also survived by her grandchildren, Sonya Skinner, Scott Stinson, Rev. Steven Stinson, Jamie Hudson, Joshua McCorkle, Adam Stiles, Lauren Carrigan, twelve very special great-grandchildren and her loving sister, Betty Jo Collins.  The family would like to give special thanks to Dr. Warden Woodard and staff at Carolina's Hematology-Oncology Associates and Levine & Dickson Hospice House for their kindness and compassion.  A service celebrating her life will be held at Northside Baptist Church at 2:00PM Wednesday, June 23, 2010 with Reverends Mark Logan, Brian Boyles, Barry Shearer and Steven Stinson officiating. Interment will be in Gethsemane Memorial Gardens.  Memorials may be made to the W. Jack Hudson Scholarship Fund at Northside Baptist Church, 333 Jeremiah Blvd. Charlotte, NC 28262 or Hospice & Palliative Care, 705 Griffith St., Suite 203, Davidson, NC 28036.

She was a blessing to know and always had a sweet spirit and a love for her Lord and her husband.  She was the epitome of a christian wife, mother, grandmother, ect.Summer RabornJuly 3, 2010I would of loved to have been a bug on the walls of Heaven the moment Joyce saw Jack.  Wow, gives me chillbumps and its a reminder that their love stood the test of time.When I think of Mrs. Hudson I think of her hugs and the way she always smelled soo good when she squeezed the life out of you.  She had the ability to make you feel special like you were the only one. Classy, funny, full of life and southern charm and most important she served God in the best way she knew how.  The older I get the more I see the incredible way God used her to touch so many lives.   She loved us kids so much and I am so thankful for the example she is to all of us.  I won't ever forget her and she is such an inspiration to me.  To the Hudson family, yall are in my thoughts and prayers.Jon RathierJuly 2, 2010Mark, Denise and family,I am sorry to hear about your mom passing away.  We will pray for your mom and your family.from your neighbor Jon RathierRegina HurayJune 28, 2010Dear Hudson Family and all Family Members - I was very saddened to hear about Joyce.  She was always such an upbeat, caring person - always had something nice to say about everybody!!  She was such a positive influence on so many people that it would be impossible to try and begin to number them.  The lifetime of service to God, her wonderful husband and her family will always be remembered and will reap rewards for years to come.  I know this is a sad time for the family members, but when I heard about her passing, I could only think of how happy Dr. Hudson was to see her again - and she him - and it brought a smile to my face and joy to my heart!!  We will keep you in our thoughts and prayers as you guys work through this very difficult time.  Love, Regina (Collins) and Jerry HurayMark PateJune 28, 2010May God bless you and your family in this time of sorrow.Doris Homan (formerly Wilson)June 26, 2010Dear Hudson family, we are so sorry to hear of Mrs. Hudson's death.  She was a lovely lady and I'm sure you will miss her. May you find peace in knowing that Dr. Hudson and she are together once again and with our Lord.   My husband and I joined NBC in 1969 and worked in the children's church(3 year old) for 18 years.  I also taught in Northside Christian Academy for 10 years (1977-1987).  We had Spanky in children's church and remember one incident which I have never forgotten.  We always had juice and crackers for snack time. One Sunday, when we had passed out the crackers and hadn't yet passed out the juice yet, Spanky said," I'm not going to eat my crackers without juice, no way, Hosea!"  He was so cute.Jacque SkinnerJune 25, 2010Dear Joyce Hudson Family,We were so sorry to hear of the passing of your dear Mawmaw.  She always made us feel so welcome when we visited Charlotte. She truly lived out Proverbs 31 as a godly woman and wife.  She had the heart of a pastor's wife with the love and compassion she showed. We rejoice that she is now in heaven with her beloved Savior and loved ones. She truly has left a legacy.  Please know that we are lifting you all up in prayer. God is so good.  He will comfort, strengthen, give peace and pour His love upon you all in the difficult days ahead. We send all our love and condolences to you. Blessings always.In Christian Love,Skip and Jacque SkinnerBlake MullisJune 24, 2010Mark, Linda, Patsy and Family, we only heard of your Mom's homegoing from our Pastor Tad Marshall a day or so ago. We share your sadness in this time.  Although we have been away from Charlotte for many years we have many memories at Northside.  May you find peace beyond all understanding at this time.  Blake and Linda Mullis[email protected]Allen WellmakerJune 24, 2010Dear Mrs. Joyce Hudson family,I did not hear anything about Mrs. Hudson's homegoing until last night at our Wednesday night prayer meeting at our church (Southside Baptist Church, here in Rock Hill, SC). I would have loved to have been at the service had I known about it. I had spent many years at Northside (from 1968 to 1983) and have worked along side all of you in those years. I always loved to hear Dr. Hudson preach and enjoyed watching you "children" grow up and have families of your own. I have never forgotten any of you over these years. I still think of you all often and love you. And, I still miss Northside. I will continue to pray for the family as you go through this time. May God give you the strength and grace you need at this time.Please, make sure that Linda, Pasty, Mark and Mrs. Betty Jo Collins (and Darrell) get this information from me. Thank-you very much!If you need to get in touch with me or Marsha, we are still here in Rock Hill, SC. Our address and phone number are listed below, if needed.Again, God Bless You!Sincerely,Allen Wellmaker637 Wildwood Drive Rock Hill, SC  29730(803) 324-0522[email protected]Beth LanhamJune 24, 2010Patsy, Mike and family:  We are so sorry for your loss.  We didn't personally know your mother, but she sounds like a remarkable person.  We just found out about her passing, otherwise we would have attended the service.  Please know that we love you guys and you are in our thoughts and prayers.  With love, Beth and Kerry Lanham.Roger HudsonJune 23, 2010My mother and father lived in the Jackson Homes Apartments with Jack and Joyce before they were saved.

God bless the family.Theresa ThijsJune 23, 2010Dear Hudson families,I want to send my thoughts and prayers to you as I remember Dr. & Mrs. Hudson. I graduated with Sonia their granddaughter (1990) and her grandparents were so dear to all of our class at NCA.  She was a wonderful lady and we were so blessed to know her.

I am so sorry for your loss, I remember Mrs Hudson always being there for the children & always remembering each one as if they were the only one there.  She called each of us by name & she was so kind & gentle.  I have been away from Charlotte for many yrs., but I have never forgotten my time at Northside & wonderful memories of the Hudsons.Gina Barber Carpenter, Danville, VAJune 23, 2010Walt and I were both saddened to hear of the loss of our "First Lady" of Northside, but what a celebration there must have been in Heaven to welcome her home! She and Dr. Hudson will always hold a special place in MY heart, as it was because of their obedience to the Lord's call on their lives, that I had the opportunity to come to know the Lord under their ministry many years ago. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this difficult time. Thank you for sharing your mother with us for the years that we were at NBC.  May you find great comfort in knowing how many lives she touched while here on this earth and what a great legacy she leaves behind. We were truly blessed to have known her.Emilie & Walt DavisTeresa ArmstrongJune 23, 2010God's comfort and peace to each family member as you cherish sweet memories and a Godly example.Donna (Claud) WorkmanJune 23, 2010Dear Family, Joyce and Dr. Hudson are Christian icons.  They will live in the memories of those that knew and loved them, and the legacy they have left behind will be appreciated for many years to come. As time passes, I understand more and more the beautiful sacrifice they gave for the Lord’s service, how many people they’ve touched; how many lives have been changed, mine included.   Can you imagine all the friends and family waiting for Joyce at Heaven’s gates?  Most wonderful is that she is with the Lord now.  Since Heaven is a perfect place, I suppose Joyce & Syb will have to behave! Much love to you,Lucinda and Joey StevensonJune 23, 2010Hudson Family,Our family would like to offer our sympathy to your family at the passing of Mrs. Hudson. I enjoyed meeting her in the church nursery when I first moved to Charlotte 23 years ago. She was always the first lady of NBC.

Mrs Hudson.  I think back to the years of my growing up at Northside and the years of my children, Michael and Ashlie,  growing up at Northside and I'm in awe of the influence that she and Dr Hudson had on our lives. They both have left such a legacy that all of you can be proud of. She will definitely be missed, but it makes me smile to think that she's sitting up in heaven with Pastor, both healthy again enjoying the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. You are in our thoughts and prayers and we love you all very much!June 23, 2010It was a wonderful show of love and respect everyone had for Mrs. Hudson tonight at her visitation.  Our prayers are with her family as you go thru this difficult time.Mike & Cathy HaneyJim RabornJune 23, 2010After Pastor Hudson passed away, Mrs Hudson remained strong and faithful to the Northside Family and always had a word of encouragement. She always had a great sense of humor and didn't mind putting you in your place. She was a strong lady in her own right and faithful in running the nursery, a less than glamorous job, yet so important for a church. She was very gracious and did a great job managing a household and being a mom to 3 great kids. We are mournful here, but Heaven is having one heck of a welcome home party.  May The Lord bless and comfort all the Hudson family. God is so good!Barbara & Andy HoggeJune 22, 2010Dear Hudson FamilyAndy and I want to express our sympathy in the passing of this wonderful and loving mother,grandmother,and great grandmother.

But her and Dr. Hudson's life contributed for the good in so many lives and our community.

We love you all and are praying for God's comfort for you all!!Bonita PickettJune 22, 2010To Linda, Patsy, Mark:How sad I feel to imagine the sight of your precious families without Joyce being in the midst of it all! She was "my Pastor's" First Lady for my 41 years at Northside and she certainly left a great impression on my life. She had a way of making Me feel like I Was Part of Her Family, too. So Warm, loving, and tender. The only way I can even deal with her absence is to think of the reality that SHE is with her beloved Jack. Wow! and what a Heavenly Reunion that must have been! Thank you all for sharing your Mom with me and my family. Because of your parents and their influence, each of you will ALWAYS hold a special place in my heart. May the pain of loss quickly be replaced by the simple joys of memory. Love, BonitaSusan & Tim Gillingham & Jimbo WilsonJune 22, 2010Dear Linda, Patsy, Mark & families, we were saddened to hear of your loss, but my, what heaven has gained!

May the Lord bless you & keep you, and may He comfort you in the way that only He can. Love & prayers,Joyce, Barry, and SybilPatti FordJune 22, 2010Joyce will surely be missed by all who knew her...but how much richer heaven will be now that she is finally home! This is my favorite picture of Joyce and my Mom...oh and Barry, too!  This reflects the humorous personality in all 3 of them!  This was taken when the new (old) coliseum was built on Tyvola.

Larry and Hazel HessJune 22, 2010Hudson Family,I had the opportunity to serve as Dr. Hudson's Minister of Music from 1986 until his homegoing in 1990. He was a man of compassion in and out of the pulpit. During those years we grew to love Mrs. Hudson as the perfect "Proverbs 31" wife and mother. She was a real treasure to the church and the Hudson family. Hazel and I still sing a song that says "Heaven's Sounding Sweeter All the Time". This is really true for the Hudson family at this time. God bless her memory.Showing 1 - 53 of 53 resultsMake a Donation in Alice Hudson's nameMemorial Events for Alice HudsonTo offer your sympathy during this difficult time, you can now have memorial trees planted in a National Forest in memory of your loved one.Plant TreesPlant TreesHow to support Alice's loved onesHonor a beloved veteran with a special tribute of ‘Taps’ at the National WWI Memorial in Washington, D.C.The nightly ceremony in Washington, D.C. will be dedicated in honor of your loved one on the day of your choosing.Read moreAttending a Funeral: What to KnowYou have funeral questions, we have answers.Read moreShould I Send Sympathy Flowers?What kind of arrangement is appropriate, where should you send it, and when should you send an alternative?Read moreWhat Should I Write in a Sympathy Card?We'll help you find the right words to comfort your family member or loved one during this difficult time.Read moreView AllResources to help you cope with lossEstate Settlement GuideIf you’re in charge of handling the affairs for a recently deceased loved one, this guide offers a helpful checklist.Read moreHow to Write an ObituaryNeed help writing an obituary?
