If you've been here before, you know that I haven't been keeping this
page updated.  I recommend you check out
Bob Beers's "Unofficial
Stephen Hunter Website" for all the details I had planned to
include here, but never made the time to do.
PALSE HORSE COMING!!
Pale Horse Coming is Stephen Hunter's newest novel, just out in
hardcover.  This is one of his best!  An amazing, un-put-downable
novel that makes Earl Swagger every bit as awe-inspiring as his son
Bob Lee is!
