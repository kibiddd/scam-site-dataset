Gumbylives10Surprise, Arizona4257Changing of the Guard at the Parliament and nighttime light showReview of Parliament Hill and BuildingsReviewed July 23, 2010 If you are in the beautiful city of Ottawa, check out the 10am or 10:30am changing of the guard at the Parliament building.  The guards will walk from their barachs along the Wellington Street to and from Parliament Hill.  You can get better pictures of them in the street than you can when they are in formation on the Parliament lawn.  Also if you don't need to hear the music you'll have a much better view by going across the street to the NCC Capital InfoCentre /white building  and go to the viewing windows on the 2nd floor.  800-465-1867You can take pictures and see the ceremony much better than fighting for a view on the lawn.  There are also days when the RCMP are on the grounds where you can take pictures with them.  Make sure to go on either side of the center building to see all the gardens and statues.  At noon a yoga class is held on the parade grounds in front of the Parliament. Make sure you take a guided tour and stop at the tower before you leave. You get to see a wonderful interior (take lots of pictures), the Senate, House of Commons and the beautiful architecture.  Make sure you look at the ceilings and ask what some of the paintings mean.  The tour is about an hour.  Get there in advance to reserve a tour its worth it.    The information center also has quite a few displays depicting the history of the Parliament.  The tour guides compete for 38 slots each year and are flown into Ottawa, and their housing is paid for by the Parliament.  They have to go through language testing but can only be a tour guide for 1 year.  Its a chance of a lifetime to get their foot in the door for Gov't service, etc.  July 8 - Sept 12th there is a nightly light show on Parliament Hill.  Its free, a must see.  There is also a light show during the holidays, July 1 (Canada independence day) and at Christmastime.  take a look at mosaika-sl.caAsk Gumbylives10 about Parliament Hill and Buildings9  Thank Gumbylives10 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

ArthurMFGreenville, SC104389Reviewed June 29, 2010 Very interesting and informative tour.  Go late in day to avoid crowds.Parliament buildings come with a free guided tour.  Can view both chambers and the library.  Tour lasts about 1 hour and is very informative.  We got in the last tour at 7:20 and walked right in with no waiting for tickets.  Tours given in both English and French.  Highly recommend.Ask ArthurMF about Parliament Hill and Buildings5  Thank ArthurMF This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

MarcelinhaCuritiba, Brazil125141Reviewed June 29, 2010 Nice view. And that´s allThe place itself is beautiful, nice architecture and pretty views from the river. However, the tour inside the aprliament is ridiculous. To go to this tour I had to leave another things behind and I was really disapointed. It takes a long time to enter and you only visit a hall and the library. The other things are show in posters. Although it´s free, it´s really ridiculous.Ask Marcelinha about Parliament Hill and BuildingsThank Marcelinha This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

TexasCatBirdGatesville, Texas685540Reviewed June 27, 2010 Awesome sight overlooking OttawaPart of our eastern Canada vacation included a stopover in Ottawa to see the Parliament.  Upon arrival we were in awe of the grandeur, location overlooking the city and river, plus how opulently the buildings were designed.  First you should go find the large white tent to secure your tour ticket and time.  Tours are free.  With about 30 people per tour and many tours going on at the same time, it is sometimes difficult to hear your tour guide, so try to stay at the front.  We toured the Senate, Peace Tower, library (magnificent) and memorial chapel (emotionally charged & quiet room).Ask TexasCatBird about Parliament Hill and Buildings1  Thank TexasCatBird This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

oldfolkieRockford, Illinois9582Reviewed January 21, 2010 Ethereal BeautyWe drove up to Ottawa on a whim and were more than glad we did.  A beautiful city with beautiful people.  We were more than impressed with Parliament Hill and the tour of  the main building.  The library had an almost ethereal beauty and it alone was worth the tour.  If you go in summertime, you must see the sound and light show.  It made us immensely proud of Canada and her people - and we're from the US !  We loved it so much we saw it twice on two evenings!  >  >  >  >Ask oldfolkie about Parliament Hill and Buildings1  Thank oldfolkie This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
