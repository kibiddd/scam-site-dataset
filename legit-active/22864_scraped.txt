Introduction (INTR)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, my name is Luthfi Mawarid or MegaFun. If you think, I'm not an expert
of English language, so I'm sorry if my grammar was wrong and quite
unreadable. Well, this is my first FAQ.I also accepts feedbacks from readers
of this FAQ. I'll try to fix this thingies on my second FAQ (If I had
one...).Pokemon is one of my favorite Game Boy Advance games (I will call it
GBA).It's fun and had some puzzles in it. Finally, I got an interest on those
legendaries, so I decided to write a FAQ on this.
Well, because some of my weaknesses, I will said something special. THIS FAQIS
FOR PUBLIC. That means, you people can use it for your website or post it
somewhere. You have to e-mail me first, of course. My e-mail is:
blazepert@yahoo.com; you'll notice something strange on my e-mail address if
you know R/S/E pokemons. Anyway, let's back to the FAQ. You're free to use and
rearrange my FAQ UNLESS something bad happens. Try not to do anything bad
okay? GOOD!
Art of Catching Legendaries (AOCL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think that legendary pokemons is extremely hard to find, hard to catch
and extremely valuable? The answer is: 1.It's not hard to find, as long as you
met with some requirements. I'll list the requirements before the legendary,
so don't worry.2.Yes; it is very hard to catch, like some rare pokemon. But,
there are two things you can do to make it easier to catch:
-Types of balls affect the success rate for catching a pokemon. For example,
it is nearly impossible to catch legendary pokemon with poke ball. But, there
is a super higher chance with using Ultra Ball. So watch for types of balls.
-Status conditions can also affect the catch rate. I would recommend
inflicting
a freeze status to the legendary. But, since it's quite rare and very hard to
get, I would recommend using sleep for legendaries. Paralyze were not very
effective.
3. Yes, It's extremely valuable. If it's above lv80, I think it could beat
almost every single pokemon in a few blows...So, did you get the thing? Keep
that in mind.
LG and FR original legendaries (LFOL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There are some few good legendary pokemon that you can catch. I will list them
here.
ZAPDOS
*****************************************************************
Requirements and preparations to catch:
-Beat the gym leader Koga.
-Get a pokemon to learn surf.
-Get loads of Ultra Balls (25 or more).
-Get a rock pokemon for lowering Zapdos' HP (optional).
Place:
Power Plant-Fly to the PC near Rock Tunnel and surf to the nearest body of
water. You'll reach a big building. Enter there.
Power Plant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the entrance, simply go straight way to the top and turn, then go
downwards. Turn again and go straight. Then turn, go downwards, turn again
until you see the king of this place. Save immediately before examining him.
ZAPDOS	LV 50
TYPE: ELECTRIC&FLYING
ABILITY: PRESSURE (Foe uses 2 PP even if only launching 1 attack).
*****************************************************************
Attacks:
Thunder Wave (Elec)-Sends a shockwave that paralyzes you.
Drill Peck (Flying)-Pecks on you rapidly and hurts you.
Agility (Psychic)-With a psychic power, it sharply raises his speed.
Detect (Fighting)-Detects the next attack and avoids it.
Reduce his life to red and change to a pokemon and use sleep powder (make sure
Zapdos doesn't uses Drill Peck).After that, keep throwing ultra balls at him.
If he awakes, use sleep powder again, then throw ultra balls. He should be
caught soon. Now after you get it, you'll get a brand new legendary, Zapdos.
Train him enough. He'll be quite useful on the next legendary.
ARTICUNO
*****************************************************************
Requirements and preparations to catch:
-Beat the gym leader Koga.
-Get loads of Ultra Balls (30 or more).
-Get a pokemon that knows strength (found Gold Teeth somewhere in Safari Zone
and give it
to the park warden in Fuchsia City).
-Get a pokemon that knows surf.
-Get a rock/steel/fire/thunder pokemon to reduce Articuno's HP (optional).
-For escaping easily bring escape rope (optional).
Place:
Seafoam Islands-Go to Fuchsia City and go surf to the sea. After the surf,
you'll reach a land. Go to the cave there.
Seafoam Islands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simply go down, down, down (you can push the boulder to the hole if you didn't
bring escape rope) until you (and your boulder) falls to the water. You'll
brought by the current to another area. Go to the land and head to a ladder in
the middle of this room. Now go up the ledge, ignore the ladder and go down
the ledge again. There'll be some rocks and two holes. Push the CLOSEST
boulder to you straight two steps, then push down the boulder next to it 1
step. Push it again to left 1 step. Push the closest boulder near the hole
away.
Then push the boulder before 2 steps left. Push it to the hole, and push the
boulder next to the hole to the hole. Next, push yourself to the hole. You'll
fall. The water current was blocked by the rocks. Simply surf north until you
reach the throne of ice. Save!
ARTICUNO LV 50
TYPE: ICE&FLYING
ABILITY: PRESSURE (Foe uses 2 PP even if only launching 1 attack).
*****************************************************************
Attacks:
Mist (Ice)-Wraps allies with a mist that prevents status reduction.
Agility (Psychic)-With a psychic power, it sharply raises his speed.
Mind Reader (Normal)-Makes sure that the next time you attack will be 100%
hit.
Ice Beam (Ice)-Shoots sharp ices to hurt foe.
The same tactic as Zapdos. I suggest you bring 30+ Ultra Balls because he's a
bit harder to catch than Zapdos used my Zapdos'(Lv 53-55,I installed TM
Shockwave to him)shockwave to reduce Articuno's HP red in 1 hit, but he dies
because he get hit by the powerful Ice Beam. If he didn't die, I could use
Thunder Wave, but he dies, so I use Sleep Powder. Keep throwing Ultra Balls.
That time I just want to do a joke throwing 1 Great Ball, but unfortunately he
was caught........
There are two ways to escape from this cave:
-Easy way, use Escape Rope. OR......
-The hard way. First from the entrance of the cave you should keep pushing a
boulder to holes until it reaches water and you reach land (you should keep
pushing yourself down the hole too.)Go to the ladder in the middle on the
room. Go to the next ladder. Go to the ledge and go to the ladder there. Then,
go down to the lower level of the land. Turn left and go up the ledge to reach
the ladder.
In the next room, turn right and go to lower level to see a boulder and a
hole. Again, push the boulder and yourself to the hole until you've reached
water. The water current has blocked. Go up to the land and o to the ladder.
Keep going until you can get out of the cave!
MOLTRES
*****************************************************************
Requirements and preparations to catch:
-Beat the gym leader Koga.
-Beat the gym leader Blaine.
-Could go to Island 1.
-Get loads of Ultra Balls (25 or more).
-Get a pokemon that knows surf.
-Get a pokemon that knows strength.
-Get a pokemon ready to learn rock smash (Chansey, Rhyhorn, Machop, etc).
-Get a water/rock/thunder pokemon to reduce her HP quickly (optional).
Place:
Mt.Ember-You can do this right after you defeat Blaine and went out of his
gym. Bill will ask if you would like to come to Island 1.Say yes. After a long
scene, you'll end up controlling yourself. Go out of the PC and surf to the
north. Past the grasses and you'll meet a cave door. That is Ember Spa. Enter
there. Speak to everyone and someone will give you HM Rock Smash. Install it
to your pokemon. If you go to the middle of the spa pond it will restore your
pokemon's health. Go out and surf to the north. You'll reach Mt.Ember.
Mt.Ember
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Turn left and push the boulders away. Go ^ and go to the upper level. Smash
the
rocks you see. Go straight ahead to the cave. Go and follow the narrow path to
the ladder. In the next room, go straight past the stairs and turn right to
the
next room. Go south to reach an open room. Turn and go up to the mountain
peak. Push the boulders away. Save before talking to her.
MOLTRES LV 50
TYPE: FIRE&FLYING
ABILITY: PRESSURE (Foe uses 2 PP even if only launching 1 attack).
*****************************************************************
Attacks:
Fire Spin (Fire)-Traps you with spiral of fire and hurt you for 3-5 turns.
Endure (Normal)-Endures a very powerful attacks so that she leaves 1 HP left.
Agility (Psychic)-With a psychic power, it sharply raises his speed.
Flamethrower (Fire)-Breathes flame at you, has a chance of burn your pokemon.
Zapdos' Shockwave could reduce her HP to red, especially if she uses Endure.
If she does, you may want to use Shockwave again. After that, use either
Thunder Wave or Sleep Powder. Start to throw Ultra Balls until you've caught
her. Actually you can catch her before Zapdos. For that, you may bring a water
pokemon or rock or something that is resistance to fire and flying.
MEWTWO
*****************************************************************
Requirements and preparations to catch:
-Beat the Elite Four.
-Get National PokeDex.
-Fix the Network Machine with Ruby and Sapphire Gem.
-Get a pokemon that knows surf.
-Get a pokemon that knows strength.
-Get TONS of Ultra Balls (or perhaps Master Ball, this is hard to choose, I
know).
-Get a dark/bug/ghost pokemon to reduce his HP rapidly (optional)
Place:
Cerulean Cave-Go to Route 24 above Cerulean City through the Golden Bridge.
Surf into the little river and you'll reach a land. Enter the cave.
Cerulean Cave
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Go surf to the river. Follow the river way and drop to the land in south end
of the river. Go up the stairs and ignore the first ladder. Go downstairs and
you'll see a ladder. Go there. Here, go to south and turn right. Ignore the
first pathway and continue your way. From here, just follow the path to the
ladder. Go to the next ladder. Go downstairs and follow the pathway to a big
river. Surf to the river and go to a small island with Mewtwo there.  Save
and prepare for a harsh battle.
MEWTWO LV 70
TYPE: PSYCHIC
ABILITY: PRESSURE (Foe uses 2 PP even if only launching 1 attack).
*****************************************************************
Attacks:
Swift (Normal)-Shoots a star beam to you.
Recover (Normal)-Recovers half of his HP.
Psychic (Psychic)-Emits a strong psychic wave to hurt you.
Safeguard (Normal)-Prevents allies from suffering a status ailment (this is
annoying).
Oh yeah, you're right. He DOES have Recover and Safeguard, making himself hard
to catch. And his ability is pressure! With this my Frenzy Plant which only
have 5 PP will run out quickly. He will heal himself with Recover and
Safeguard will prevent him from paralyze, sleep, etc. This is hard to catch
with Ultra Ball. I used Frenzy Plant and Sleep Powder to get him. I caught him
with Ultra Ball. But, trust me, it was such an accident (or maybe luck!)
RAIKOU/SUICUNE/ENTEI
*****************************************************************
Requirements and preparations to catch:
-Beat the Elite Four.
-You'll get different pokemon if you choose...
Charmander as a starter pokemon: You get Suicune.
Squirtle as a starter pokemon: You get Raikou.
Bulbasaur as a starter pokemon: You get Entei.
-Get a pokemon that has a resistance type to the pokemon (example
Entei is Fire-type; you bring Vaporeon which is Water-type).
-Get a Wobuffet when the legendary pokemon has a red HP and a
status ailment.
-Get a MASTER BALL OR TONS OF ULTRA BALLS.
Place:
Well, I HATE to say this but, they can move to ALL OVER KANTO REGION. You
could get very frustrated. Meeting them in the first place depends on luck.
The annoying thing again is when you met them in a battle, after you finished
attacking them, they will simply ESCAPES from you and you'll need to look for
them again. They will NEVER, EVER STOP DOING THIS.
RAIKOU/SUICUNE/ENTEI LV 50
TYPE: ELECTRIC/WATER/FIRE
ABILITY: PRESSURE (Foe uses 2 PP even if only launching 1 attack).
*****************************************************************
Raikou attacks:
Thundershock (Electric)- An electricity shock that has a chance to paralyze
foe.
Roar (Normal)-Roars to send foe away.
Quick Attack (Normal)-An attack that strikes first.
Spark (Electric)-An electrified tackle, has a chance to paralyze foe.
Entei attacks:
Ember (Fire)- Spits a fire that could burn foe.
Fire Spin (Fire)- Traps you with spiral of fire and hurt you for 3-5 turns.
Roar (Normal)- Roars to send foe away.
Stomp (Normal)-Stomps enemy that may cause flinching.
Suicune attacks:
Bubblebeam (Water)-Burst bubbles to you.
Gust (Flying)-Creates a whirlwind to attack you.
Rain Dance (Water)-Makes Water-type moves stronger than usual.
Aurora Beam (Ice)-Shoots a beam of aurora that may lower attacks.
After the Mewtwo 'incident', I still have my only one piece of Master Ball. I
tried to found Entei (my starter pokemon is Bulbasaur). I wander everywhere
around Kanto and ran into him near Pallet Town (do you know that the song when
we battled with legendary pokemon is different from the ones when we battled
ordinary pokemon? When you run into Raikou, Entei or Suicune, you'll hear the
legendary song). I don't want to waste time so I caught him with Master Ball.
R, S, E original legendaries(RSEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
R, S, E original legendaries means Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald
original legendaries. Huh? You didn't know those games? Well, in case that you
didn't know, Pokemon LeafGreen, the games we're playing were based on a region
named Kanto. Pokemon Ruby and whatever I said above were based on a region
named Hoenn. A different region could mean lots of new cities, new facilities
and of course, tons of BRAND NEW POKEMONS! Now, is there any legendary
pokemons over there?
The answer is a big YES. It has a lot more than Kanto. If you had to know, we
can make a whole party of legendary pokemons. If you want to get them you must
transfer them to Kanto.
A.K.A TRADE
Things needed:
-2 Game Boy Advance
-A Pokemon LeafGreen/FireRed Game Pak
-A Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald Game Pak
-Game Boy Link Cable
Plug in the Link Cable into both device. Turn on both games and go to any
Pokemon Center, then go up to the second floor. Take the pokemon you want to
trade and talk to the lady in the right counter. You must do this in both
games. Follow the instructions and inside the room. Both players have to
examine the machine in the middle of this room. Choose the pokemon you want to
trade and exchange it with another pokemon!
Miscellaneous and secret legendaries (MASL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Although there are original legendaries, there are some secret legendary
pokemons that you can't obtain by only searching it. That needs certain
things. I'll list them here. Huge thanks to www.serebii.net for this.
