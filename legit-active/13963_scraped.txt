Amazing  (feat. Young Jeezy) Lyrics
It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved
[Amazing (feat. Young Jeezy) Lyrics On http://www.elyricsworld.com/ ]
And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
I'm amazing
Yeah I'm all that
If I ain't on my grind,
then what you call that?
Victorious
Yeah we Warriors
We make history
Strive off victory
Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Got high blood pressure
Even let the Feds get 'cha
I'm amazing
Born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in,
No spoon.
That's why I'm so Goon
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house
no room
And you like oh god
why he go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
