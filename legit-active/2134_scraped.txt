4 Great reasons to buy from us:
The Great Taste No Pain plan has been carefully constructed to stress the importance of nutrient-packed, delicious real foods while adhering to the principles of proper food combining.  Food combining is an eating lifestyle that centers on pairing foods together that require similar digestive enzymes (acid versus alkaline), which makes meals less taxing on your digestive system and encourages more efficient and complete digestion.
When your digestive process can work more effectively, you'll find relief from common digestive symptoms such as gas, bloating, constipation, and heartburn.
Since the proper elimination of wastes and complete breakdown and assimilation of nutrients from foods are crucial for your body's systems to function properly, improving the digestive process can encourage healthy weight loss and other positive changes in overall health and well-being.
Since its inception in 2007, Great Taste No Pain has helped tens of thousands of people suffering from gastrointestinal issues achieve better digestion and dramatically improve general health and energy levels. In addition, many people have reported being able to lose excess weight and keep it off.
It’s important to stress that Great Taste No Pain is not a diet. It does not require you to swear off whole food groups, count calories, rely on meal replacement bars and shakes, track points or severely restrict portions.
The Great Taste No Pain plan:
Reveals you how you can take control of your digestive pain and help turn it around at a primary root cause
Explains how simple it is to put together meals that are easier for your system to break down and that taste positively spectacular
Does not require special foods or costly meal supplements—all foods are available at your local grocery store
Helps you gain a better understanding and appreciation of the significant role your diet plays in your health from head-to-toe﻿
With Great Taste No Pain, you can still enjoy foods you love and meals that will leave you satisfied with no feelings of deprivation. See for yourself what a difference it can make in your overall health when your digestive system is working more like it should… and enjoy every mouthwatering bite toward better health!

After a severe back strain, pain meds caused acidosis. My chiro sent me on a search and I found this book! It was the best money I spent!!! I got relief with the first meal but was afraid to stop taking my acid blocker at the time. After about 3 days I quit and no heartburn! The recipes are great and shows you how to make your favorite meals alkaline! You can still eat your spicy foods, desserts, anything you want without suffering! I no longer wake up in the middle of the night literally drowning in acid and spending a half hour to an hour trying to cough up acid out of my windpipe!               j          jacqui F.
