2010-11 Kansas Jayhawks College Basketball Predictions and OddsBleacher ReportNBAWorld FootballNHLMLBMMA28:49Featured VideoMen's Sweet 16 Predictions üîÆCollege Basketball2010-11 Kansas Jayhawks College Basketball Predictions and OddsDoc MosemanJun 1, 2018Last year, Kansas was the heavy favorite to win it all going into the NCAA Tournament. People around the country were putting Kansas on the final line in their March Madness brackets office pools. The Jayhawks cruised through the first round, but Northern Iowa stunned them in the second round. The upset was the biggest of the tournament and one of the biggest in the last few years.Kansas finished the season at 33-3, but there is no doubt that last year‚Äôs team should have accomplished much bigger things at the end of the season. Kansas will still be a team to watch in the 2010-11 season, but they‚Äôll definitely see a bit of a drop off in their win total.TOP NEWSMen's NCAA Tournament 2025 Power Ranking the Sweet 16 TeamsBleacher Report13hMen's NCAA Tournament 2025: Upset Meter for Every Sweet 16 GameBleacher Report1dReport: UNC's Elliot Cadeau Enters CBB Transfer Portal with 'Do Not Contact' TagBleacher Report4hKansas Jayhawks College Basketball Offseason ChangesKansas loses as much talent as any team in the nation. Sherron Collins was a four-year star at the point guard spot, and he will be missed greatly. Cole Aldrich was a tremendous physical presence down low, and this year‚Äôs squad will have no one that can match his production. Xavier Henry was only at Kansas for one year before becoming a lottery pick in the NBA Draft this year.There are a couple of big name recruits coming to Kansas this year.Josh Selby is definitely the best of the group, and he has the potential to be a star. Selby will be one of the quickest guards in the country, and he rebounds very well for a point guard. The problem with Selby is the NCAA hasn‚Äôt cleared him yet. Selby has been cleared academically, but his amateur status is still in question due to a possible improper contact with an agent.Royce Woolridge is a freshman that could make quite a bit of noise for this team. Woolridge is great at taking the basketball to the hoop and finishing in traffic. He is the son of former NBA forward Orlando Woolridge, so he comes from a great basketball family.Kansas Jayhawks Basketball Predictions: OutlookDon‚Äôt expect anyone to be feeling sorry for Kansas because of all their losses from last year‚Äôs team. This is still a team that has far more talent than most teams ever have. Markief and Marcus Morris will take on a bigger role this year. Expect the Morris brothers to fare well down low. Tyshawn Taylor is probably the best defender on the Jayhawks squad, and I expect him to continue to improve in what will be his junior season. Senior guards Brady Morningstar and Tyrel Reed will be expected to step up their play and be leaders in the backcourt.The Jayhawks may miss Aldrich‚Äôs defensive presence as much as anything this year. Aldrich was one of the best shot blockers in the nation, and he gobbled up defensive boards in huge numbers. In order for this team to keep competing at the highest level, they will need someone to step up and be a force down low.Kansas Jayhawks College Basketball Betting OddsThe Jayhawks are accustomed to being the favorites in the Big 12, but they are actually listed by college basketball handicappers as second best this season. Baylor is listed at +250, while Kansas is listed at +275 to win the conference. Bookmakers list the Jayhawks at +1,500 to win the NCAA Championship.Kansas Jayhawks Basketball ScheduleKansas is scheduled to take part in the Jimmy V Classic in early December. The Jayhawks will match up against Memphis, who they beat in the amazing 2008 NCAA Championship Game. On the whole, the  non-conference schedule for Kansas is relatively weak this year. Kansas must travel to Waco to take on Baylor in their third Big 12 game, so there is a lot on the line early on in the conference season. The Jayhawks will take on Missouri in Columbia to finish off the regular season on March 5.Kansas Jayhawks College Basketball Predictions and PicksKansas will certainly be a good basketball team, but they have too many question marks to count on them this year. I don‚Äôt expect this team to be down for too long, but I do think the 2010-11 season will be the worst Kansas has had in the last few years. Expect Kansas to make the NCAA Tournament, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll do much damage once they get there.28:49 Men's Sweet 16 Predictions üîÆTOP NEWSMen's Sweet 16 Power Rankings üìäBleacher Report13hUpset Meter for Every Men's Sweet 16 Game üå°Ô∏èBleacher Report1dElliot Cadeau Enters PortalBleacher Report4hTourney Team Moving to D-IIIBleacher Report6hTop 20 Players in Sweet 16 ‚ú®Bleacher Report1dTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dCollege Basketball Transfer Portal 2025: Tracking Decisions for Notable PlayersBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dSweet 16 Bracket: Updated Schedule and Upset Picks for Men's NCAA TournamentBleacher Report‚Ä¢4hReport: Minnesota's Frank Mitchell Transfers to Adrian Wojnarowski's St. BonaventureBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dSEC Sets NCAA Tournament Record with 7 Sweet 16 Teams amid Kentucky, Alabama WinsHaven‚Äôt had a March Madness like this in 18 yearsBleacher Report‚Ä¢8hCooper Flagg Headlines 2025 Naismith Men's College Player of the Year FinalistsCooper Flagg headlines final four TRENDING ON B/RBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dCollege Basketball Transfer Portal 2025: Tracking Decisions for Notable PlayersBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dSweet 16 Bracket: Updated Schedule and Upset Picks for Men's NCAA TournamentBleacher Report‚Ä¢4hReport: Minnesota's Frank Mitchell Transfers to Adrian Wojnarowski's St. BonaventureBleacher Report‚Ä¢1dSEC Sets NCAA Tournament Record with 7 Sweet 16 Teams amid Kentucky, Alabama WinsHaven‚Äôt had a March Madness like this in 18 yearsBleacher Report‚Ä¢8hCooper Flagg Headlines 2025 Naismith Men's College Player of the Year FinalistsCooper Flagg headlines final four Bleacher ReportAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersSitemapCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyCookie PreferencesTerms Of UseB/R Sports on MAXB/R Creators ProgramCopyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
