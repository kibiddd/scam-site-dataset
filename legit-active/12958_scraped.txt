CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The thing that made Grady Sizemore nearly great also made the greatness short-lived. Sizemore played all-out, as hard as he could, day-in, day-out, until the walls he ran into and the doubles he legged out in a cloud of dust and the players he crashed into all took a toll on his body.A particularly fond memory is of Sizemore scoring in a clatter of spikes and a swirl of dust on a wild pitch in the "Bug Game" in the playoffs against the Yankees in 2007, when he upended pitcher Joba Chamberlain, who was covering the plate. It was a symbol of the way the Indians upset the best-laid plans of baseball’s highest-paid team in a divisional series upset.Sizemore endured five operations on everything from his knees to his groin to his elbow, with the accompanying drop-off in performance. The small-market Tribe had little choice but not to renew his contract Monday when Sizemore was resistant to re-doing it.But at his best, Sizemore was a 30-30 man in home runs and stolen bases and, for a brief time, he was the Central Division’s best player. It didn’t last, like the unseasonable weather at the midge game, but it was something to see while it did.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
