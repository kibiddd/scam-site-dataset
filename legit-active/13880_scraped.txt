Boullard, Pretre, performing the curial functions. Nicolas Binet died at the age of 48.During his life he worked as a Domestic for the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, the same order to which his neice, Elisabeth Bissonet, had professed her vows and for which her father, Louis Bissonet, was a farmer.He was Godfather to Nicolas Binet, son of Francois Binet and Marie Charlotte Parent . He was witness to the marriage of Jean Defoy to Marie Jeanne Maurice and to that of his brother, Francois to Marie Charlotte Parent. The burial certificate notes that Nicolas Binet was attended at his death, probably by the sisters, and the hour was noted as "about eleven-thirty."He was interred in the cemetery next to the church in Montreal, Quebec. Witnessing the burial were Deat, Pretre; Talbot, Ecclesiastique and Favard, Pretre -- all associated with the Convent of the Congregation. According to La Forrest, it is this Nicolas Binet who accompanied a pregnant Gabrielle Stebbens to Deerfield, Massachusetts to recover her 10 year old son who was being kept by her father-in-law.They returned without the child who remained.The recurring conflict between the French and the British resulted in the Stebbens family being split by national loyalties and faith practices.The Grandfather, in his perhaps bitterness at the loss of his children, chose to keep and raise this particular child.La Forrest, according to family genealogist, Frank Binet, was very meticulous about his research and Frank is sure that it is this Nicolas Binet and not Nicolas Binet of Boucherville and godfather to Gabriel Stebbens who travelled on this mission.

Family information regarding births, deaths and marriages taken from certificates as referenced and Family Certificate # 1767. From Gary Boivin: Not all "dit" names go back to France or when they arrived here in North America. Many come later and some only applied to one person and not to a whole family. I cannot find a document anywhere that has the first BRISSONS as "dit'' DuTILLY. A few years ago we researched for a Noel DUTILLY who lives in Hanmer, Ontario --- When I say "we" I'm referring to a volunteer group that I belonged to called " Recherches Genealogiques du Moyen Nord " (Mid-North Genealogical Researches) . We found some BRISSONs in the late 1700's that used the DUTILLY name but there is no documented case of: Rene BRISSON s/o Pierre BRISSON and Marie NAVARRE Married to Anne VEZINAS-VESINAT d/o Jacques VESINAT & Marie BOISDON-BOURDON Nor did his son: Rene BRISSON Married to Genevieve TESTU Nor did their son: Pierre BRISSON married to Catherine M. COURTEAU-COURTOT Noel Augustin was the first BRISSON that we found listed as DUTILLY in the original church registries. Later... others used the name and not all of them were Noel Augustin's descendants. We did find some newer data with questionable historic data explaining the DuTILLY, DUTILE, DUTILLE, or TILLY "dit" name --- usually written by a descendant of a BRISSON-dit-DUTILLY. The reason I say questionable is because we could never find proof to verify these stories. If you know of proof I would love to read it. ----- Original Message ----- From: "Elizabeth M.
