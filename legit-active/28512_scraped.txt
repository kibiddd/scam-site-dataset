WELCOME TO POVERTY BAY COFFEE COMPANY, WE ARE MICRO-COFFEE ROASTErs with a Purpose, Local to SEATTLE, WA
At Poverty Bay Coffee Company we are fully committed to supporting coffee farmers who are 100% committed to sustainable agriculture. We do this by giving them a sustainable price for the world-class coffee they nurture and harvest. Also, by working with independent importers like San Cristobal and Jungle Tech who bring the best sustainable, direct trade, shade grown coffees to market, we at Poverty Bay are able to support small-scale coffee cooperatives. You, as the coffee consumer, can trust that your cup of coffee is improving the lives of farmers and protecting our natural resources. It is this relationship that is responsible for the fact that our locally roasted coffee beans are among the best coffee beans you will find anywhere in the world. It is our core belief that quality and integrity can, and should, go hand in hand. Every coffee bean we buy and every bean we roast is proof. By supporting Poverty Bay Coffee Company, you too are supporting the farmers and their land.
