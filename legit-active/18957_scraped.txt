BiographyTriviaFAQIMDbProAll topicsRobert Lowery(1913-1971)ActorSoundtrackIMDbProStarmeterSee rankPlay trailer1:02Jalopy (1953)4 Videos99+ PhotosRobert Lowery was born Robert Larkin Hanks in Kansas City, Missouri,
the only living child of Roscoe Hanks, noted Kansas City attorney and
oil investor; and Leah Thompson, concert pianist and organist. He
attended local Kansas City schools and graduated from Paseo High School
in 1931 with a record as an accomplished athlete. He played with the
old Kansas City Blues baseball team and was a boxer and football
player. After a field injury in which he broke his pelvis, he built
himself back to strength working at a paper factory in Kansas City.
With the premature death of his father at 43, he and his mother moved
to Los Angeles in hopes of his landing film and theater roles, given
his good looks, athletic ability and outstanding physique. He enrolled
in Lila Bliss' acting school and soon came to the attention of
Twentieth Century-Fox after successfully appearing in a number of stage
roles in the Los Angeles area. He was signed to Fox in 1938, and was
soon appearing in such first-class films as
Drums Along the Mohawk (1939).
Although not known for his stage work, he appeared in several major
theater productions, such as "The Caine Mutiny" and "Born Yesterday"
(as "Brock") with his wife and fellow actress
Jean Parker. He enjoyed a film and
stage career that lasted well into the 1960s, at which time he started
a second career with Jackie Coogan in a
celebrity travel cruise business. One of his more notable film
appearances was with Ray Danton in
The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960)
and he turned in a rare, but funny, performance as a political hack
governor on the make for John Wayne's
ex-wife in Wayne's western comedy
McLintock! (1963).As he matured into middle age, he acquired a startling resemblance to
Clark Gable. He also appeared extensively in
television, including as Big Tim Champion in the 1956-57
Circus Boy (1956), also starring
Noah Beery Jr. and
Micky Dolenz (pre-Monkee days);
Playhouse 90 (1956); episodes of
Hazel (1961) and
Pistols 'n' Petticoats (1966)
starring Ann Sheridan, with Lowery playing
Buss Courtney in the 1966-67 season. He and wife Jean had one son,
Robert, who lives in Redondo Beach, California, with his wife Barbara
and twin thirteen-year-old girls. Lowery passed away from a heart attack
Christmas night of 1971, and is buried at Valhalla Memorial Park in
North Hollywood, California. His motto: "Whatever's fair." He took a
less-than-serious view of life and his career, and was well-loved by
his friends and family as a raconteur and humorist.BornOctober 17, 1913DiedDecember 26, 1971(58)BornOctober 17, 1913DiedDecember 26, 1971(58)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
