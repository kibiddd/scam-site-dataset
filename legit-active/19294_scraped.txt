Doesn't use canvas so you don't know what your grade is until transcripts come out, extremely condescending if you share your opinion. Dumbest essay prompts of all time. Take this class if you want to purposefully lower your gpa.

But if you are active and participating in his class you will soon notice he is one of the best professors you will take. The way he conducts class makes his students think and he is very authentic. If u want an engaging good class please take him.Amazing lectures HilariousBeware of pop quizzesHelpful 1 0 AMST200Dec 5th, 2024Quality5.0Difficulty2.0 AMST200Dec 5th, 2024For Credit: YesAttendance: MandatoryWould Take Again: YesGrade: Not sure yetTextbook: N/AOnline Class: YesAll you need to do is do the readings and watch the videos assigned before class, attend class, and participate in class discussions to do well.

If you need anything to convince you not to take this class, the final had 73 readings you needed to incorporate and analyze fully. He's not afraid to give you a 50 for forgetting things.Get ready to readParticipation mattersHelpful 0 1 AMST200Dec 3rd, 2024Quality2.0Difficulty4.0 AMST200Dec 3rd, 2024For Credit: YesAttendance: MandatoryGrade: Not sure yetTextbook: N/AOnline Class: YesThis class is truly exhausting. I think I've done more reading for this class than all of my other major classes combined this semester. He's very condescending and passive aggressive. Harsh grader and seems to have no rhyme or reason to why he takes off points. Takes forever to grade things and you don't know your grade til transcripts drop.

(they're actually interesting). His humor is extremely sarcastic, but I honestly found it refreshing and hilarious. You will learn A LOT as he's very knowledgable. Just always be thorough AND insightful.

Most people who rate him poorly likely didn't participate. Very reading heavy though, make take a few days to prepare notes. Only had "bad days" when nobody spoke in class.

I took AMST 200 with him and am currently taking his HON 300 class. We always have such meaningful discussions about past historical events and how they are tied to current day events and politics. The readings/essays are thought provoking; the essays are difficult, but he gives great feedback.

He's the toughest grader and docks you a ridiculous amount of points for the smallest things. The grades are reading quizzes, two papers, participation, and a final. I seriously think he just wants to give all his students C's. Would never take him again.Tough graderGet ready to readParticipation mattersHelpful 1 3 AMST200Oct 24th, 2024Quality1.0Difficulty5.0 AMST200Oct 24th, 2024For Credit: YesAttendance: MandatoryGrade: Not sure yetTextbook: N/AOnline Class: YesDO NOT TAKE!!!! Talking in this class is the only reason you will pass and even when you do it is extremely stressful because if you are wrong he will absolutely rip you to shreds. Extremely political. Grades terribly and you will never know your grade until the transcript comes out. Sometimes makes funny comments or stories but its rare.Tough graderParticipation mattersBeware of pop quizzesHelpful 2 3 AMST200Oct 10th, 2024Quality1.0Difficulty5.0 AMST200Oct 10th, 2024For Credit: YesAttendance: MandatoryGrade: D-Textbook: YesOnline Class: Yeshe is a straight up comminist DO NOT TAKE. he has pop quizzes almost every class about the long readings where he says to answer in one sentence but wants the detail of a 25 page essay. he is so political and you can tell. so rude, harsh grader, always gives 50's . do anything but take this classTough graderParticipation mattersBeware of pop quizzesHelpful 0 3 AMST200Oct 10th, 2024Quality1.0Difficulty5.0 AMST200Oct 10th, 2024For Credit: YesAttendance: MandatoryGrade: Not sure yetTextbook: YesOnline Class: Yesabsolute worst professor I've ever taken.I took this class because it was my last gened and I read these reviews and thought everyone was being dramatic bc they actually had to do work.
