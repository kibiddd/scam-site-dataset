Dan in Real Life (2007)
Dan in Real Life Blu-ray delivers great video and solid audio in this  overall recommended Blu-ray release
Love strikes in the worst possible circumstances for widower, single dad and popular family advice columnist Dan Burns when he falls for a beautiful stranger in a bookshop  only to discover she's the very same woman his charismatic brother is about to introduce as his incredible new girlfriend at their parents' annual get-together. As the weekend gets underway, Dan and Marie scramble to hide their mutual attraction to each other, resulting in a series of hilariously awkward situations. Yet, even under those circumstances, they can't help falling in love. Now, Dan is about to realize that  no matter how many good suggestions he might have for other people  when it comes to romance and family, the hardest advice for a man to follow is his own.For more about Dan in Real Life and the Dan in Real Life Blu-ray release, see  Dan in Real Life Blu-ray Review published by Martin Liebman on March 7, 2008 where this Blu-ray release scored 3.5 out of 5.Director: Peter Hedges

Dan in Real Life Blu-ray Review
An unexpectedly good film arrives on Blu-ray in a tidy package.
Reviewed by Martin Liebman, March 7, 2008
Plan to be surprised.
Dan In Real Life feels like real life, a comedy replete with humor that is never forced or
phony.  It feels improvised rather than scripted and lived rather than acted.  It's sometimes hard to
tell that
you're watching a movie rather than sitting in a room with these characters.  The movie flows at a
natural, graceful pace, telling a simple story of love at first sight that's never been told quite like
this.  Every character is drawn as if from some real-life inspiration, and each acted as if the
inspirations themselves played the parts.  All of this is high praise, but don't expect Dan In Real
Life to sweep the Oscars.  It's not that high-class of a film.  What it is, however, is a smart, fun,
touching, unexpected, believable, family-friendly, and heartwarming comedy/drama that pushes all
the right buttons, and not a button too many.  Even though we think we know how the story
will end, we're not quite sure we're right until the credits roll.
Dan is stunned to learn that movies are not real life.
Dan In Real Life derives its title from a newspaper column of the same monicker, written
by
single parent Dan Burns (Steve Carell, Evan Almighty).  He's been raising three school-
aged
girls alone since his wife passed away four years ago, rarely heeding his own advice on parenting
in
his soon-to-be-maybe-syndicated column.  He must deal with the budding "love" one of his
daughters feels for her lab partner, the incessant nagging about learning to drive by another, and
the trials and tribulations of his youngest, a girl almost too smart for her age, caught in the
middle
of it all, only wanting some love and attention from her dad.  "You're a good father, but
sometimes
a bad dad," she says to him.  On an excursion to Rhode Island for an annual family gathering,
Dan meets
Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat), a charming yet mysterious woman who only tells him
she's seeing someone after he begins to fall for her during a chance meeting in a used book store.
Unfortunately for Dan, she's in town for the same family reunion, and she's dating his brother
Mitch
(Dane Cook, Employee of
the
Month).  Not only is Dan's trip ruined, but everyone is encouraging him to get
together with this "mystery woman" for whom he's got puppy-dog eyes.  He also finds himself
guilty in the eyes of his daughters, as his actions parallel those he's forbade them of
engaging in--namely falling in love at first sight and bad driving--while ignoring the needs of his
youngest.  As Dan loses his sanity, his family tries to regain it for him, but the object of his desire
and that which is causing his meltdown is constantly under his nose, and worse yet, on his
brother's arm.
In a world of generic romantic comedies and films with low-brow humor and plots you can figure
out even before you've bought
your tickets, Dan In Real Life is a cinematic breath of fresh air, creating a wholly
unpredictable, fun, and moving picture.  What really makes this one work is the cast.  Steve
Carell is a natural actor, a man who, in the vein of the greats of comedy like Bill Murray, relies on
timing, deadpan facial expressions, and charm to win over audiences rather than crude hijinks
and dialogue.  The rest of the cast is first-rate in the picture as well.  Each character, though
stereotypes some of them may be, are played by the actors with a heart and charisma rarely
seen in a
movie like this.  The direction by Peter Hedges (Pieces of April) is simple and extremely
effective, letting the cast do their thing as he sits back and points the camera at the action.  A
film that defies several genres, Dan In Real Life perhaps creates its own, a new genre
that showcases, well, real life, without letting cinematic contrivances and formulas get in the way
of a genuine, interesting, original, and worthwhile motion picture.
Dan in Real Life Blu-ray, Video Quality
This 1080p, 1.85:1 framed transfer is another winner from Disney.  While Dan In Real Life
won't be asked to attend any Blu-ray awards ceremonies, this transfer simply gets the job done,
showing us a very pleasing, film-like image.  There is generally a very nice array of colors
throughout the movie.  They are not brilliant or eye-popping, but rather just a tad dull, and truer to
life than some of the hot, over exaggerated colors often seen in comedies.  The image lacks a
good bit of vibrancy and three-dimensionality as a result, but gains a very naturalistic, pleasing look
that is theatrical in appearance and feel.  Film grain didn't seem to be on display in abundance.
Flesh tones
looked pleasing and real, though there is perhaps a slight reddish tint to them in many scenes.
Black levels are also good, but there aren't a lot of scenes that truly showcase them.  The image is
sharp and clean, both befitting the newness of the film, with nary an overly soft spot or print
defect.  This transfer is definitely not one to wow your friends with for just a "hey look
how cool Blu-ray is" fleeting moment in time, but if you sit down to watch this one with them, I
think it'll show them the power of 1080p high definition anyway.
Dan in Real Life Blu-ray, Audio Quality
Presented with an uncompressed PCM 5.1 soundtrack, Dan In Real Life sounds rather
humdrum, but it's supposed to.  You won't find any loud musical cues, gunshots, explosions, or
sound effects whizzing all around you, but that doesn't mean this one isn't "good."  With practically
zero participation from the subwoofer, the track nevertheless retains a good amount of depth and
understated
finesse.  Surrounds are generally only active during the soft, easy going music.  It finds its way into
the rear, creating a pleasant, natural, and room-filling experience.  There were one or two corny,
fake-sounding effects, such as a scene where several doors slam all around Dan, and therefore all
around us.  The effect seemed out of place and unnatural.  The movie also features fine dialogue
reproduction, and as the mainstay of the soundtrack, it takes top priority, sounding
natural, clear, and precise.  Other than that, there is just not much to say about this one.  It
sounds fine with no audible flaws.
Dan in Real Life Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras
Disney brings Dan In Real Life to Blu-ray with a fine supplemental package.  First up is a
commentary track with writer/director Peter Hedges.  He discusses the origins of the script and
some real-world influences that seep into the final product.  He offers a play-by-play of many
scenes, including the order in which they were filmed, improvisations, subtle hints and
innuendos, and other trivial anecdotes.  This is a fairly standard fare track, and only the most
hardcore of Dan In Real Life fans will want to listen for the entire length of the film.
Just Like Family: The Making of 'Dan In Real Life' (1080p, 15:01) features some of the
same material heard in the commentary, including the origins of the story and the script, and its
evolution once it made its way into the hands of Peter Hedges.  This feature also showcases
interviews with the cast, and their discussions revolve around the comedic tones in the film, the
intricacies of setting up different shots, and the bond the cast came to share by the end of the
film,
making it all the more a believable, single family.  Handmade Music: Creating the Score
(1080p, 9:50) is a look at the music, or lack thereof, throughout the film.  Director Peter Hedges
describes his influences for the music, namely that from other films, his choice in composer, and
the style of
music he wanted in his film.  There is also a nice look at the making of the talent show scene
featuring performances by Steve Carell and Dane Cook, and the role composer Sondre Lerche
played in
that and several other scenes throughout the film.  Next up are eleven deleted scenes (1080p,
20:09) with optional commentary by
Peter Hedges.  Finally, 3:26 worth of outtakes, presented in 480p, round out this decent set of
supplements.
Dan in Real Life Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation
To say I enjoyed this movie is an understatement.  It's replete with everything you could possibly
want in a movie like this--a fresh, engaging, and entertaining story, great acting, and a few good life
lessons thrown in for good measure.  This Blu-ray edition sports a very good video presentation, a
reserved but effective audio presentation, and a fun helping of extra material.  All in all, Dan In
Real Life is a winner, a film most of the family can and probably will enjoy, and the cast of
characters is so big, diverse, and likable, just about everyone is bound to find someone they can
relate to.  Combining big laughs, small laughs, originality, and a good, quick pace, this is one not to
miss for family movie night.  Definitely recommended!
