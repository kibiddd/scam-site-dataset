Ed Helms never had an adult incisor grow, and his fake incisor was taken out for the parts of filming where Stu's tooth is missing.GoofsThe formal name for "roofies" is given as "Ruphylin". The drug is really a trademark brand named Rohypnol, but was changed for the movie because the makers did not want to be associated with the depicted criminal activities.QuotesStu Price: She's got my grandmother's Holocaust ring!Alan Garner: I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust.Crazy creditsFirst part of the end credits feature a collage of photos showing what happened that night.Alternate versionsThe UK release was cut, this film was originally shown to the BBFC in an unfinished version. The BBFC advised the distributor that the film was likely to receive an 18 classification but that the requested 15 classification could be obtained by making one change to visuals in the closing credits. The BBFC suggested that brief shots in which a man is being fellated by a woman, with clear sight of an apparent erect penis in the woman's mouth, be removed. When the finished version of the film was submitted, the shots had been removed and the film was classified 15.ConnectionsEdited into Yoostar 2: In the Movies (2011)SoundtracksIt's Now or NeverWritten by Aaron Schröder (as Aaron Schroeder), Wally Gold, Eduardo Di Capua (as Eduardo DiCapua), Giovanni Capurro and Alfredo Mazzucchi (as Alfredo Mazzuchi)Performed by Robert 'El Vez' López (as El Vez)Courtesy of Graciasland RecordsUser reviews862ReviewFeatured review8/10A really funny movieI can not remind myself that I've laughed this much for a long time. Everything from start to finish offers a wonderful blend of humor, so I think everyone will find something they like in this movie. It's hard not to find a favorite character because all the characters have so many things to offer.After seeing this movie for the third time, I think it has exactly the same charm as the first time. I will probably look at it many more times in the future and that says a lot about the movie. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it and if it's been a long time since you saw it, watch it again! It's worth it.Bubach92Jan 10, 2012PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ26How long is The Hangover?Powered by AlexaIs "The Hangover" based on a book?What movie was Alan referring to?Where did the chicken come from?DetailsEditRelease dateJune 5, 2009 (Canada)Countries of originUnited StatesGermanyOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial siteLanguageEnglishAlso known asLendemain de veilleFilming locationsCaesars Palace - 3570 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA(location)Production companiesWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentGreen Hat FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$35,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$277,339,746Opening weekend US & Canada$44,979,319Jun 7, 2009Gross worldwide$469,328,922See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 40 minutesColorColorSound mixSDDSDolby DigitalDTSAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page
