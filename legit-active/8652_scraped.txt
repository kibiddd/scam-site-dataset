Vintage Master wins Cane Pace at Freehold
Sep 7, 2009 - 10:01 PM
FREEHOLD, N.J.(AP) -- Vintage Master ran away with the $325,000
Cane Pace in stakes-record time at Freehold Raceway on Monday.Driven by Daniel Dube, Vintage Master paced the mile for
3-year-olds in 1:50.4 to finish 5 1/2 lengths ahead of Clear
Vision. The Jimmy Takter-trained winner paid $4.80, $2.80, and
$2.20, pushing his career earnings to more than $1 million.The Cane Pace is the first jewel in the Pacing Triple Crown. The
next race in the series will be the Little Brown Jug on Sept. 24
at the Delaware County Fairgrounds in Ohio.Arctic Warrior, a $35,000 supplemental entry to the race, tried
for the lead off the starting gate, but Dube had Vintage Master
on top as the field completed the first quarter-mile. Vintage
Master increased his lead at every call from there, and his time
equaled Art Official's track record."I didn't know if he could be that good on the front end," Dube
said. "He was awesome. He was not even tired at the end of the
mile. I just touched him and he went again. It was great."Vintage Master has won 3 of 15 races this year. In August, he
won the $677,665 Delvin Miller Adios and he was second in the
million-dollar Meadowlands Pace in July.Clear Vision was followed by Arctic Warrior, Mr Wiggles, If I
Can Dream, and Hail Storm. Western Posse and Johnny Z were
scratched.
