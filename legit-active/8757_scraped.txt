The Château d’Auvers hosts a special exhibition Van Gogh : The Final Journeys from October 2023 to September 2024 in Auvers‑sur‑Oise. It offers visitors a glimpse into Vincent van Gogh’s stay in France (1886‑1890), and more specifically his time in Auvers‑sur‑Oise, during which he created over 75 paintings in less than 70 days, between May 20th and July 29th, 1890. The exhibition also highlights the crucial role of Vincent’s brother, confidant, and patron, Theo van Gogh. Wouter van der Veen, a researcher and specialist on Vincent van Gogh, is the curator of this special event.Read moreDuration: 1-2 hoursSuggest edits to improve what we show.Tours & experiencesExplore different ways to experience this place.See options364What is Travelers’ Choice?Tripadvisor gives a Travelers’ Choice award to accommodations, attractions and restaurants that consistently earn great reviews from travelers and are ranked within the top 10% of properties on Tripadvisor.Top ways to experience Chateau d'Auvers and nearby attractionsVan Gogh House Tour -

On the afternoon of March 30, 2024, I visited Auvers-sur-Oise Castle for the first time to celebrate Vincent van Gogh's birthday.
Although the ticket office staff were particularly friendly, a disconcerting situation arose after we entered. We returned to the place where we had failed to visit Van Gogh's blossoming almond tree, but a black employee working on the top floor stopped us.
Certainly changing tour itinerary can be a problem, but in this case we should have been informed in advance. We received no indication about this either in the leaflet provided on site or when we entered. No mention was made on the signs indicating the impossibility of returning to the rooms already crossed.
This employee had no reason to block us. If he wanted to deny us access, he should have presented us with the rules in force or provided an explanation. However, he only said that it was not allowed, which led us to believe that we were victims of racism, because this restriction had not been announced in advance. The reason is that in the rooms previously visited, other visitors moved freely.
We have already visited many museums in France where it is possible to return to the rooms already visited or to re-enter if necessary. Unless otherwise indicated, we consider ourselves to be legitimate visitors who have paid their entrance fee. There are no restrictions on when or where we can view the works.
Do not tarnish the image of this place and of France with its beautiful reputation because of a discriminatory employee.Read moreVisited March 2024Traveled with familyWritten March 31, 2024Dea ex machinaBelfast, United Kingdom85 contributions4 of 5 bubblesI visited the chateau to see the exhibition on van Gogh’s last journey.
The exhibition was well put together, clearly with the input of the Van Gogh foundation in Amsterdam, and audio guide by Wouter van der Veen.
A general overview of van Gogh’s travels through his life, culminating in his end in Auvers.
The final part of the exhibition was a visual presentation on the work of Johanna Bonger and her son to launch van Gogh’s work onto the world stage.

I was greatly disappointed as I thought it would be a chateau with furnishings.  We were guided through empty rooms with no more that blank walls & no windows.  It was an exhausting walk up & down stairs to watch images projected on blank walls.  It was tedious & I was hoping that the end of the tour was near.  A boring experience which would be difficult for an elderly person like myself & impossible for a person handicapped.  Not recommended.Read moreWritten June 5, 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

But I must admit my very llast visit, about ten days ago, was very disappointing. I really liked and enjoyed the first version of the parcours in the footsteps of the impressionnists. To some it may have sounded old-fashioned. But it was real fun. It was didactic and you could actually learn something from it. It was really enjoyable - going to the cabaret/café, getting on the train. THAT was really good. And after something like 90 minutes, you had really enjoyed the experience and you had actually learned something from it. Why did they change that? Why did they turn that into a parcours that is clumsy, doens't really make sense, has lost its soul and is often downright boring indeed? Who designed the new parcours - a lot of money has been involved in it for sure. And the videos are not bad. But there is - compared to the former parcours - no story told, no feelings felt, no fun experienced. I will probably never go back. I will never take any adult groups there, like I used to. This is a missed opportunity.Read moreWritten August 8, 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

You go from room to room and sit down to listen to a 5/10 min commentary with clips shown on the walls...no major proper pictures to see there at all in fact... at 12 euros for full price entrance fee I would not recommend it...go round the gardens is my advice, that s enough and that s free.Read moreWritten July 1, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It takes a while to understand you need to start each room as the videos start- note there was is countdown projected to show start time how long each rooms images last. Be sure not to dawdle or you have to wait about 10mins. We loved the opportunity to see the enlarged details of each painting and the quiet time we visited made for a truely enjoyable experience. Our only comment was the French audio is quite loud - so try to avoid standing under a speaker!Read moreWritten February 9, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It consists of videos playing on a loop on giant, wall-sized screens, explaining what inspired the impressionists, tracing how the world was changing at the time, and explaining through a stunning series of LED panels a bit about the Surrealism and Cubism that followed.The thing is, the videos play on a loop. With commentary in French. So you have to figure out how to sync your audio guide and that proved really tricky.All in all, though, a great experience.Read moreWritten November 7, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Through eight halls / rooms, you journey through the story of impressionism (2 dedicated to Auvers). The experience is not only edifying but the technology used is a mind-blowing blend of moving images, still images, images of paintings, music, ambient sound and a narration, al of it projected onto giant screens or walls. It is immersive, sensorial and very informative. If you don't know French, take the audio guide. It's free. The only difficulty is syncing the audio guide to the start of each of the eight episodes. Other than that, it was the best 15 euro I spent in Auvers.Read moreWritten October 27, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
