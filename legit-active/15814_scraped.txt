Critics Consensus
A riveting look at the life of legendary DJ "Petey" Greene, Talk to Me goes beyond the typical biopic with explosive performances from Don Cheadle and Chiwetal Ejiofor.

The New Yorker
Don Cheadle brings sharp humor and deep passion to his portrayal of the Washington, D.C., disk jockey and talk-show host Petey Greene in this historically vital and acute bio-pic...

It's a visually and aurally riveting trip to an important time from a perspective few here will know, about a person worth meeting.

The List
Though funny in places, the film lacks any decent secondary characters... but it's easy to see why Lemmons would decide to keep the camera as much as possible on the two excellent central performances.
Rated: 3/5

The Oklahoman
Cheadle's skillful performance makes Petey a flawed hero worth rooting for, even when his actions offend. Ejiofor also impresses with his subtle turn as the conflicted, success-hungry Dewey. In addition, the film boasts an excellent sound track.
Rated: 4/4

This is a fairly run of the mill type bio drama film. It has decent enough performances and the backdrop of the civil rights movement makes it somewhat thought provoking, although I wouldn't say this film is entirely about that but more its an element of the plot. I liked that the main character, Petey, is a very honest person and tells things as they are. There were some fairly amusing moments with the radio boss, E.G. Sonderling, played by Martin Sheen, not best pleased with the new found supposed talent that is rushed on to his stations airwaves. The story is interesting, in as much as its based on a true story but I don't think there's much else I can say about it. If it sounds particularly interesting or relevant to you, then yes I'd recommend it, otherwise maybe not.

All you have to do is just talk
Kasi Lemmons directs the true story of Ralph Greene starring Don Cheadle, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Cedric the Entertainer, Mike Epps, and Martin Sheen
Outspoken ex-convict Ralph "Petey" Greene talks his way onto the air at a white-owned radio station in 1960s Washington, D.C.
The citizens are not collaborating but community activist Dewey Hughes wants to turn things around hiring a new DJ and that turns out to be Ralph
Fueled by the new music and social upheaval of the times, he courts controversy while becoming the voice of the black movement
Ralph has quite the mouth even upsetting the FCC and his radio manager but it's the kind of voice everyone needs to hear
Segregation, civil rights, and the influence of Martin Luther King, Jr. is what has Ralph talk about the things that need to be heard by all
WOL became a station of the people with listeners calling in to share their input
It was more than just music it was an outlet to be heard
The ultimate measure of a man is where he stands in times of challenge and controversy, a world burning is not what we should work towards, we should all tell our truths even if we are sad or angry, it's the voices of the people that should matter
Ralph didn't want to be a public speaker though and wanted no part in political activism just his radio setting was enough
Eventually he and Hughes parted ways and Petey passed away at 52
But his influence on the radio waves remains a staple; he said the things we were afraid to say
The movie avoids many of the typical biopic tropes too
Cheadle and Ejiofor make a great budding pair
Some stuff is too over the top or exaggerated and less than compelling secondary characters but there's great performances for sure

Starts out as an entertaining character study and ends up an After School Special on Civil Rights and the evils of alcohol and stardom. Cheadle is incapable of being bad. But he deserves much better. At times it seems like Taraji Henson's puppies are the real star of the story,
