So, I stumbled upon this gem of an article recently (images below) that asserts our purpose in #HR is to "form friendships" at work and therefore we are "better off" donning our party hats and confetti cannons than being "ground into the vortex" of HR work.
Now, I don’t know about you, but I’ve always dreamed of orchestrating office karaoke showdowns and ensuring the breakroom donuts have appropriate variety.
Afterall, that not only creates REAL connections at work but is also a driver to genuine #culture and #employeeengagement, right?
Who needs data driven decisions when we could instead be blowing up balloons!🎈
Career growth and workforce plans? Nah, host a dance party instead! 💃🕺
Why spend time on creating a talent brand and value proposition when instead we can host the office talent show! 🎊
Strategic compensation and retention planning? Shelve that in favor of coordinating a pickleball tournament! 🎾
Talent development and engagement? Why waste your time when there's an office snack bar to stock! 🍓
The actual examples in the article include - an office choir and a weekly BBQ.
(Thanks to Brice Johnson for sending the article to me - yes this article is real, yes it was published in a legitimate periodical, and yes it was written in 2024 ... and yes connections and intentional culture curation are important but we are certainly not "better off" planning choirs and BBQs, especially since there are more genuine ways to create connections)

As many teachers do, I had a healthy dose of identity confusion when I left my classroom: "Am I really not a teacher anymore?" Well, I'm not a teacher in a traditional sense, and the past few years have clarified that for me.
My "subjects" are less singular (e.g., organizational development, DEI).
My "classroom" is now made up of workplaces across various industries.
My "students" are a bit older, but with their own inner children.
My "curriculum" remains people-centered and action-oriented.
And all things considered, "I" am still a "teacher."
My consulting practice has evolved into "Elynndí" to better capture this fact: that our identities as teachers depend less on 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 we operate, and more on 𝘩𝘰𝘸. After all, a teacher's skill set has been crucially central to what makes my approach to this work unique—work I am excited to continue doing. :)

OD practitioners, leaders, and coaches: What are some of the things in your practice that is aimed to help teams build trust?
In a recent conversation with People Strategist, Rick Beaton, PhD he shared this interesting opinion that "org structures are designed for 'why would you trust anyone?'” and he called for amplifying the specific conditions and behaviors that increase trust. (Link to the episode in the comments)
Which got me thinking about my own OD work and the ways that I’m either designing for trust or ignoring the structural mechanics of distrust.
There are a couple things I do…
— Within my working definition of Op Model, one of the components is “Team Agreements,” which are the critical few behaviors that leaders want to see amplified in the organization aligned to vision and execution goals.
— Within people leader role expectations, we outline behaviors and actions a leader takes with their directs that empower autonomy and accountability.
— We invest the time into building clarity on vision, workflow, decision rights, and role accountabilities so adherence to expectations is highly visible.
— I quote the four elements of trust from Stephen M. R. Covey’s book, “The Speed of Trust,” daily (slight exaggeration?) when working with org leaders so they have the language of trust — not saying “trust me” but instead demonstrating the elements of intent, integrity, capabilities, and results (see, I did it for today!).
Interested in hearing from anyone on this, and a couple people on my mind: Lakshmi Gopalkrishnan, Bennett Bratt, J. Mark Meadows (he/him), Kellee M. Franklin, PhD, Garin Rouch Chartered FCIPD, Dani Bacon, Melissa Janis, Melissa Martinez Barroso, David Snavely, Nenuca Syquia
What are some of the things in your practice that is aimed to help teams build trust?

Today I listened one episode of Future of HR Podcast ( my fav HR podcast, subscribe if you want to learn and upskill yourself in HR topics) and feel inspired by the conversation between Angela & JP Elliott, PhD  about Servant Leadership...
Leadership is about connection, not complexity.
Organizations often get caught up in building complex, million-dollar systems to address leadership development and career growth. But let’s pause for a moment and think—what are the basics of foundational leadership?
It’s not about fancy tools or systems. It’s about having genuine conversations.
It’s about investing time to understand your team members’ aspirations.
It’s about dedicating yourself to co-creating career paths that make sense for them and the organization.
Here’s a simple truth: you don’t need a sophisticated platform to do this. Open an Excel sheet. Schedule dedicated time. Ask questions like:
“What are your career goals?”
“What skills do you want to build?”
“How can I support you in getting there?”
Leadership starts with showing that you care enough to engage. Sometimes, the most impactful things are the simplest ones: listening, guiding, and taking action.
Let’s not overcomplicate what it means to be a good leader. Start small, but start today.

Recent #SHRM #research underscores the pivotal role of people managers in aligning employee #commitment with #organizational goals. Yet, many managers face daunting challenges like heavy #workloads, resource constraints, and competing priorities, which can stymie their effectiveness.
🔍 Key Insights
A stark contrast in employee commitment levels correlates with managerial effectiveness: 63% commitment under effective management vs. 28% otherwise.
Over half of #HR #professionals emphasize the importance of clear strategic goals and productivity metrics in evaluating managers.
💡 Strategic Initiatives for Improvement
Enhance Clarity: Clearly define roles and responsibilities to eliminate ambiguity.
Skill Development: Focus on upgrading coaching and strategic thinking skills.
Support with Tools: Equip managers with necessary tools like project management software and performance analytics.
Leadership must not only set clear expectations but also provide the resources managers need to thrive. Let's empower our people managers to excel, fostering a culture of success and commitment.

An organization with #PsychologicalSafety is not one that shies away from hard conversations. It's one where employees feel safe to speak up (without fear of repercussions) and know they will be heard.

Not all HR data is created equal. If we want HR to be seen as a strategic business partner, we need to focus on the metrics that matter most—the ones that provide strategic insights and align directly with organizational goals.
HR data typically falls into four categories:
* Operational HR: Metrics like absence rates and compliance reporting—necessary, but not game-changing.
* Strategic HR: Metrics like cost per hire and workforce planning—offering insights but limited in direct value to the business.
* Talent Optimization: Metrics like time-to-productivity and skills gap analysis—focused on improving talent outcomes.
* Strategic Insights: Metrics like top talent turnover, leadership effectiveness, and succession planning—these are the high-value, high-insight data points that truly move the needle.
When we shift our focus to strategic insights, HR moves beyond just “support” and starts driving real business impact. This is how we:
-  Strengthen leadership pipelines.
-  Align talent strategies with the organization’s long-term goals.
- Deliver measurable ROI that leadership can see and appreciate.
At the end of the day, data isn’t just numbers—it’s the foundation for better decisions, stronger teams, and a more competitive business. The question is: Are you leveraging the right metrics to tell the right story?
Let’s move HR into the future—data-driven and value-focused. What challenges or successes have you experienced when using HR analytics? I’d love to hear your perspective.

Starting out in HR can feel overwhelming, but there are plenty of resources to help you build a strong foundation. Here are some great places to begin:
1. SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management): SHRM offers articles, certifications, and webinars for both beginners and seasoned professionals. It's a go-to resource for HR fundamentals.
2. Coursera & LinkedIn Learning: Affordable courses on topics like recruitment, employee relations, and HR compliance. Perfect for learning at your own pace.
3. Books: Start with classics like “HR from the Outside In” or “Work Rules!” by Laszlo Bock to understand modern HR practices and strategies.
4. Podcasts: Listen to HR-focused podcasts like Everything HR (shameless plug) or HR Happy Hour to hear real-world insights and stories from HR professionals.
5. Online Communities: Join communities like Human Operations (another shameless plug!) or LinkedIn HR groups to network, ask questions, and share experiences with others in the field.
The key is to stay curious and keep learning—HR is a dynamic field that constantly evolves. What resource has helped you most in your HR journey? Let us know!

When there isn’t an established L&D function inside a small-to-medium-sized business (SMB), the allure to cut-and-paste a standard approach is often too strong to resist. But it’s the wrong thing to do. Try this instead:
BACKGROUND
Enterprise L&D look at smaller organisations with envy at their ability to wrap their arms around what’s going on, understand stakeholders, and deliver highly targeted solutions that are designed to make impact.
It’s the SMB’s agility which is its competitive advantage and the L&D team has the same opportunity, if it wishes to take it.
The standard approach to L&D consists of a comprehensive classroom training curriculum and an exhaustive library of generic online content.
But this isn’t a strategy.
It’s a basic shop front that likely needs to be in place but cannot exhaust your time, energy and budget because - and this is the hard bit to hear, especially if you’ve just set it up yourself - it’s unlikely to ever deliver you impact, let alone prepare people for future roles and address skills gaps.
It’s there because the leadership and workforce expected it to be. Without it, the cupboard looks bare and it looks like there is no L&D.
SOLUTION
The smart thing to do is to think about not only what the next step of your L&D function's evolution will be but the one after that and the one after that.
Without a shop front then you’re always in reactive mode.
With a shop front you’re more proactive but way off impacting.
To be impacting you need to hone your ability to CONSULT and ANALYSE for root causes and design to affect the work.
You can’t do this if you’re spending all your resources delivering training and trying to get employees to use the expensive online learning you’ve procured. To move from impacting to strategic you need to know how to predictably and reliably address skills gaps in a way that impacts the work and scales for the workforce.
But in order to do ANY of this, you need to have the vision, the foresight, the skills, the savvy and the leadership to take your organisation with you.
It all starts there.
***
This was inspired by last week's Office Hours session. Goodness, we get through a lot of great conversations in these sessions - and last week’s was the biggest so far.
Join us for the final session of the year on December 19th. We'll be talking about one of my favourite topics: How to develop yourself as an L&D leader in 2025.

Conversational interfaces are increasingly important for all enterprise system and specifically for HR system.
If your organization is coming up with a "10 Year Strategy Plan", and it does not involve a conversational HR system, that is the BIGGEST CONTRADICTION you will ever see.
Why, because if an organization does not invest in a conversational HR system, the chances of it even existing 10 years down the line are downright abysmal.
The data from ClayHR's customer base which launched the Ask HR module (More at https://lnkd.in/d-R7KW3Y) shows us clearly that:
1. Once the employees have tasted the success of a conversational HR system, they simply do not want to go back to a legacy interface where they are able to see the data in boring tabular data format.
2. Employees simply prefer the mechanism where they can talk to the system - whether by typing, or by using voice, but quite literally, "talk to the system".
Historically, when we digitized the systems, we came to a tabular interface because the technology of that time (think HTML, XML, JSON, Arrays, Lists etc.) across the board could support just that.
However, now that the conversational interface like the ones powered by GenAI are available - that is it. There is no going back.
Your employees are not going to go back from a conversational interface.

These aren’t limited to Halloween – they happen frequently. 2024 SHRM Research Survey confirms that 57% of U.S. workers say they’ve experienced or witnessed incivility frequently and expect the November election to escalate the number of incidents. Time to prepare for managing political discussions in the workplace, but are you ready? A recent review of SHRM articles provides tips from expert practitioners:
1.     Listen more, talk less. “Everybody comes to work with an invisible suitcase that is packed with things such as where we grew up, what kind of family and neighborhood we’re from, our political views, or our educational experience. Those are all things that make a healthy workplace. We have to be open to listen, to learn, and to understand where somebody might be coming from”, says Veronica Knuth Chief People officer at Quantum Health (7/5/24, When Politics Comes to Work). In the same article, Sonja Southerland, SPHR, SHRM-SCP, CHRO at Innovate Human Capital Solutions, adds, “If you can just be quiet long enough to listen, a lot of times you’ll get more information than if you’re presenting a case…Listening helps us understand what people are really afraid of, and then we can approach it more strategically.”
2.     Demonstrate respect and respond with civility. “Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, agnostic of whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or support one candidate or the other, says Julie Lodge-Jarrett, Chief People and Purpose Officer at Dick’s Sporting Goods (7/5/24, When Politics Comes to Work). Jonathan Segal, attorney with Duane Morris in Philadelphia and NYC, concurs. “It is fine to acknowledge the differences, but avoid attacks. There is a big difference between sharing your preference and bashing the other side. If you bash your candidate’s opponent, employees who support the opponent may feel like you are bashing them.” (10/11/24, Keep Out-of-Bounds Political Discussions from Haunting Your Workplace).
3.     Provide employees with ground rules for political discourse. Kara Govro, JD, SPHR, Principal Legal Analyst at Mineral, offers these tips (2/21/24, How to Manage Political Discussions in the Workplace):
a.     Remind employees that the workplace is a place where everyone should feel safe, welcomed, respected, and included.
b.     Communicate to employees that the company doesn’t want to limit healthy dialogue about social issues, but it does have a vested interest in reducing disruptions and maintaining a culture of respect.
c.     Encourage employees to approach these conversations from a place of curiosity and accept that they may not find common ground. Conversation should be seen as an opportunity for better understanding, not a means to change someone’s mind.
Bottom line, with good preparation and communication to set clear expectations, political conversations at work (or home) don't have to be scary. Now, let's talk about those costumes... 😨 #leadershipdevelopment #talentmanagement
