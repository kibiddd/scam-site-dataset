“I had the pleasure of managing Bill while he was employed at HARTMANN.  Bill was a tremendous asset while working with us and was instrumental in bringing on a new committed GPO agreement and managing our National Account portfolio business.  What stands out most about Bill is his attention to detail and putting the customer first.  Bill is trustworthy, reliable and is a key asset for any company he works for.”
Melissa Cole, DNP, MSW, RN-BC, NEA-BC, FACHE
“Bill has the amazing ability to ask the 'right question'.  This highly developed skill is the foundation of his strategic/conceptual sales craft.  As he sees the big picture and develops a strategic plan, he can drill down to the level of detail needed to execute his vision.  It is by asking the right question, he aligns himself with the team, develops trust and sees every customer and product as unique.  I appreciated having Bill as my supervisor - he treated me as a colleague, leveraged my strengths and took obstacles out of my way to ensure my success.
With an eye to the future and the knowledge of what is needed to move forward - Bill can develop a sales force to move a product in a new way, or develop a strategy to ensure a new product is positioned to gain momentum with the coming trends.  Bill understands how to recruit and retain talent.  I consider myself fortunate to have been on his team - and welcome an opportunity to partner with him again in the future.  Delighted to be contacted for any added information.”
