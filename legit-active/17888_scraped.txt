I think most Deadheads would agree that the Dead were primarily a live band. By that I mean they performed at their best in front of a live audience. The exchange of energy between the band and the crowd inspired them in a way that the studio simply couldn't match. Even the band members themselves have stated that most of their studio albums don't come close to their live concert recordings.
There really was nothing like a Grateful Dead concert and there hasn't been anything like it since 1995. Sure, there's still periodic reunions of the remaining band members. Their tours are certainly enjoyable but it's just not the same without Jerry.
Fortunately, the Dead were the most recorded band in history and there's no shortage of live Grateful Dead music to hear. Nearly every show they ever played was documented in some form or another. Reel to reels, cassette tapes, Beta PCM, DATs, soundboard or audience tapes - take your pick. Oh, and don't forget the videos. Deadheads practically invented the art of taping shows and they pretty much perfected it as well.
Modern Tape Trading
I've been listening to the Dead for nearly as long as I can remember. When I was younger and I first discovered the band's music I used to dream of having copies of every show ever recorded. Their music affected me in a way no other band ever has and I couldn't get enough. But it wasn't easy to find high quality tapes back then.
First, you had to know people who had them.
Then you had to convince them to make copies for you.
If you didn't have anything to trade, this could sometimes be difficult.
If they weren't close friends who lived nearby, you had to mail them blank tapes with return postage.
Then sometimes wait weeks for them to arrive, wondering the whole time if they would show up at all.
Needless to say, favorite tapes became treasures that were often played until worn out. I wanted very badly to hear all those shows that I knew were out there but had no hopes of ever finding them.
With the dawn of the digital era all that has changed. My dream has become reality. I never once thought that I would really be able to hear virtually every GD concert ever recorded. However, thanks to the miracle of the internet and file sharing technology like bittorrent, I've spent the last few years amassing an enormous collection of music and video footage.
I've benefited greatly from the generosity of a lot of people. They share freely out of pure love for the music itself and this is my attempt to give something back.
