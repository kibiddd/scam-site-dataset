The corps of engineers is being guarded by a body of cavalry. Most of the first reel is taken up with showing a love affair of a lieutenant and an Indian girl who, when the red men go on the war path, runs to her sweetheart. The second reel shows how the fort is notified. The telegrapher is caught by the Indians just as he has finished his message, and is shot; he hangs dead from the strap around him at the top of the pole. The ending seems unnecessarily brutal, but is much better than the false sentimental ending of many such stories. Taken as a whole, it is a very fair offering. - The Moving Picture World, February 22, 1913deickemeyerJul 20, 2017PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 18, 1913 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesNoneEnglishFilming locationsProvidencia Ranch, Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA(Oak Crest)Production companyBison Motion PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditColorBlack and WhiteSound mixSilentAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page
