It starts that way and pretty much stays that way in the first half hour. But, in a very subtle way, director LaBute, as though peeling the story, gradually reveals its darkness. The movie gets darker and darker by the minute and the ending is unsettling as Evelyn's revelation is exposed like an unexpected punch in the stomach. This also makes one question the 'little sacrifices' they make to satisfy their partners and the extent one is willing to go. LaBute has based the film on his play and it seems to have translated well on screen. With fine cinematography, tight editing, soulful score and solid writing, 'The Shape of Things' is certainly well made but what would it have been without its outstanding performances. Rachel Weisz is marvelous as Evelyn the artist. It can be described as a tour du force performance. Being more specific would risk revealing spoilers. Paul Rudd brilliantly suits the role of Adam (the names Adam and Eve(lyn) are an obvious reference that may define their relationship, depending on the viewer's perspective). Frederick Weller is great as Rudd's caddish friend and Gretchen Mol is very good. 'The Shape of Things' is certainly not your average rom-com. In fact, it isn't a rom com at all.ChrysanthepopAug 23, 2010PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ19How long is The Shape of Things?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateMay 16, 2003 (United States)Countries of originUnited StatesFranceUnited KingdomLanguageEnglishAlso known asLa forme des chosesFilming locationsCalifornia State University Channel Islands - One University Drive, Camarillo, California, USAProduction companiesMepris FilmsPretty PicturesStudioCanalSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$4,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$735,992Opening weekend US & Canada$173,246May 11, 2003Gross worldwide$826,617See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 36 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was The Shape of Things (2003) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
