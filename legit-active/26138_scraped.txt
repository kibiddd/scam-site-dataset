erinSB3201Santa Barbara11Reviewed July 2, 2009 The best chicken piccataPossibly the best chicken piccata I've ever had. The pizza was pretty good too (great crust). The decor is classic old school Italian restaurant complete with red & white plastic tablecloths. We'll be back again!ValueAtmosphereServiceFoodAsk erinSB3201 about Petrini's Italian Restaurant1  Thank erinSB3201 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

sbnGoletaSanta Barbara, California11Reviewed November 12, 2008 only 50 years in businessI was surprised to see that last review. We have had many birthday parties at Petrini's as it is a wonderful family restaurant. We have always had good service and good food. I think they must be doing something right as they have been in business with a bad location for over 50 years now. I have been going there for about 30 years now. Highly recommended.Ask sbnGoleta about Petrini's Italian Restaurant1  Thank sbnGoleta This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
