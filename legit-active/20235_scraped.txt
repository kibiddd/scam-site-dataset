Green Day – Minority                                lyrics
I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog
There of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd
Unsung, against the mold
Without a doubt
Singled out
The only way I know
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority
Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat now
The only way I know
One light, one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me
A free for all
Fuck 'em all
You are your own sight
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority
One light, one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me
A free for all
Fuck 'em all
You are your own sight
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority

He doesn't want to give in to the ways of the government. He doesn't want to be like everyone else and how they are controlled by every day routines in society. He pretty much just wants to be his own person and not be told what to door have to fall in line with everyone else. Green Day fans know that their main focus in their music is about the government and standing against it, being the minority.

Youth. He's living the reality that he is no longer a child. Not able to find hidout or cover in his parents, or other adults that take the blame for you when you are young and inexperienced, still learning about life. He wants to relive the days where he was young and enjoyed life, regreting some mistakes he madde and couldn't fix as an adult. He's old and tired of being told to follow the law or to do this or that. Being a kid not responsible for anything. Youth.

"Minority" is about being someone outside of the cultural norm. In a world where everyone has to feel like they belong in some sort of clique, the person in question here is deciding to make a name for himself. Granted this song was written 16 years ago (holy sh!t!), but even then if you weren't part of some group, or labelled as a follower of a trend, you were a freak, or a weirdo. The lyrics glorify that "fact" in stating that being different is better than fine, it's encouraged. You don't need to follow a group, or like a show, or eat certain things to be considered "normal". Who cares if you don't like Game of Thrones or Walking Dead? Who gives a sh*t if you don't grow a bread, or wear the latest fashion? Who f**king cares if you eat gluten or meat? Stop living in the shadow of other people! Stop following the herds, and lead your own! Go against the societal grain. Do what you want to do, and love every damn minute of it! I want to be the minority!
