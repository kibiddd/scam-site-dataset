He was born on February 15, 1985, to Rickey Lee and Jayne Tilley Graham of Mooresville. Jeremy was a graduate of Lake Norman High School and was employed by Duke Energy-Marshall Steam Station as an operator. Jeremy loved spending time with family and friends especially at the beach and on the lake. He loved racing his #5 micro sprint car and riding his motorcycle.  Jeremy was preceded in death by a brother, Rickey Lee Graham, Jr.; grandparents, Grover D. and Myrtle W. Tilley; and aunt, Demetra Graham Roseman.  His bright blue eyes, sweet smile, and loving personality will be missed by his many friends and especially his family. Jeremy had a big heart and was always the first to help out a friend, family member, or a stranger when in need.  In addition to his parents, Jeremy is survived by a sister, Trish Graham Parson and husband, Chad, of China Grove; nephew, Kobie Parson; grandparents, L. C. and Linda 'Libby' Graham, of Salisbury; many aunts, uncles and cousins that adored Jeremy, including aunt, Dianne and uncle, Eric McCarter, who were like his 'second Mom and Dad.'  They were his idols and have guided him through life with much wisdom. He will be missed by his special pet boxers, Gage and Addie.  Funeral service will be held on Sunday, August 28, 2011, at 3 PM, in the Cavin-Cook Funeral Home Chapel. Burial will follow in Willow Valley Cemetery, Mooresville.
