DETROIT -- 60,000 fans showed up at Ford Field for the home opener, and the Detroit Lions treated them to a wire-to-wire beat down of the Kansas Chiefs."The crowd was amazing, as they always are," defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said. "I love to see our field continue to be sold out - no empty seats anywhere in that stadium. I appreciate it fans, and look forward to the next time we get back here."The Lions next home game isn't until Oct. 10, when the Chicago Bears come to town for Monday Night Football.Defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch said the crowd definitely did its job when the Chiefs were on offense this Sunday."It was loud out there," Vanden Bosch said. "It was difficult for (Kansas City) to make adjustments, to run audibles, and even get the snap counts. We have a definite advantage at home, and we can feel the crowd's energy.The thing that impressed Vanden Bosch the most was how long the fans stayed despite the score."It was nice to see - I don't know how many touchdowns we were up late - that the fans were still there supporting us," he said. "They weren't in a hurry to get home, they wanted to finish this thing out with us."Wide receiver Nate Burleson said it was important to him, and his teammates, that the team delivers on the fans' expectations."We said before the game that we wanted to give the crowed what they've been wanting," he said. "Some of the coaches said in a meeting last night, 'There's no better place to throw a party than at your own house.' We had a pretty good party today."If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
