Quote of the DaySpiritualitySt. Alphonsus: “All the reprobate have been damned in consequence of their neglect of prayer; had they prayed they should not be lost; and all the saints have become saints by prayer; had they neglected prayer, they would not have become saints.  We must live in the persuasion, St. John Chrysostom says, that to neglect prayer, and to lose the grace of God, are one and the same thing.”DoctrinePope Pius IX: “In particular, ensure that the faithful are deeply and thoroughly convinced of the truth of the doctrine that the Catholic faith is necessary for attaining salvation.” (Nostis et Nobiscum # 10, Dec. 8, 1849)Home
