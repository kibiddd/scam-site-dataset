You may have your opinions about Columbus — or maybe you don't. We understand. While the world has been busy not thinking about us, we've been quietly stacking up new accolades, accomplishments and experiences. Year after year, list after list, people are starting to see the greatness we've always known was here. Now is the time we stop keeping it to ourselves.
One of the top science museums in the country, a culinary scene at the top of the food chain, immersive art that is out of this world and so much more.
Can all of this exist in one city? Yes, Columbus.
Columbus has been named a Top 10 Best Big City in the U.S., One of the Best Food Cities in the U.S. and One of the Friendliest Cities in the U.S. by Condé Nast Traveler’s 2024 Readers’ Choice Awards.
