year tour of duty in the US Air Force, Cramer came to Hollywood. All
the "credits" on his acting resume were fake when he got his first film
job on the Joel Silver/ Denzel Washington actioner Ricochet (1991). All his
scenes were opposite John Lithgow. Cramer continues to pursue his acting as
well as a feldgling writing career. He has recently completed writing a
television pilot entitled "The Pentagon" as well as a feature film
script entitled "Miller's Prize" about a WWII pilot shot down over
northern Italy. This story is based on true events Cramer learned of
while stationed 60 miles north of Venice, Italy during his Air Force
tour.BornJune 6More at IMDbProContact infoAgent infoResumeBornJune 6IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to listView contact info at IMDbPro
