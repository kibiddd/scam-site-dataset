Itâs ânoisyâ some days because itâs such a great spot to meet friends for lunch, celebrate bdays in a small group or just have a meal together. Food is very good, Maurice Salad is very good, one of the best replicas Iâve found.Is this helpful?LLinda Detroit1 review5.0Dined on March 15, 2025Overall 5Food 5Service 5Ambience 5Wow!  We had an amazing meal starting with the corned beef egg rolls and the blueberry salad.  For our main courses, my husband and I shared the pot roast dinner and the Louisiana Cajun pasta. Then the carrot cake blew us away!  And our waitress Adele was so friendly and attentive.  A great date night!
