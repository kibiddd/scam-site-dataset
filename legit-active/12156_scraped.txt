I'm in southern Ontario and it takes 3-4 days to receive the game. They have a huge library and are pretty good with their stock levels so you can *usually* get the game you want. As for another service if you dont like game access, there's www.Canflix.ca which I havent tried, but they also offer movies and games 16 years ago

I just use Blockbuster's $30 plan. It's a little more expensive, but as I have a store just a few blocks away, I can swap games easily and almost always get new releases when they come out.
