Sign In  The Daily Dish  Can Patti Make a Million Dollar Match?Millionaire Matchmaker works her magic with Madison Hildebrand.By  Colleen Werthmann Sep 15, 2011, 1:33 PM ET      Million Dollar Listing fans know that Madison Hildebrand is usually too busy selling fabulous houses to the rich and famous to find love on his own.Paging Patti Stanger. Bravo streams cross tonight as Madison pops in for some Patti prep, and the Millionaire Matchmaker couldn't be happier. "Millionaire Matchmaker meets Million Dollar Listing on tomorrow night's episode of MM on @Bravotv. You don't want to miss it! X0," she tweeted.So did Patti snag the right man for Madison at last? The ridiculously handsome real estate mogul's being awfully coy on Twitter. Yesterday, he tweeted, "Bubbye #NYC, lax I coming back to rush and shoot my next real estate piece for @ENews. Whose house will I be taking u into now??" About his matchmaking experience, Madison said only, "Excited @pattistanger for tonight's episode on MM! Thx for having me on, I caught a sneak peek & luv it, luv u!! @Bravotv @BravoAndy."Patti definitely won't have to send polished Madison to a therapist or stylist like some of her other more, uh, challenging clients. But is Madison truly too overbooked to make a relationship last? Time will tell.But are Millionaire Matchmaker and Million Dollar Listing a match made in Bravo heaven? What other shows should cross-pollinate? We've already seen the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on Top Chef Just Desserts... Who should be next? Should the Most Eligible Dallas gang grab a nosh on Top Chef Texas? Should Jeff Lewis pop in to makeover Joe and Melissa Gorga's place? Tell us which shows you'd like to see mash up.
