THE former FBI chief who became the shadowy central figure in the
one of the most gripping political dramas of the 20th century, has died
at the age of 95.
Better known by his code name "Deep Throat", William Mark
Felt, who passed away at his home in California from heart failure, was
pivotal in exposing the American political scandal Watergate, helping
topple President Richard Nixon in the process.
Felt, who grew up in Twin Falls, Idaho, where he attended the state
university, began life as a lawyer, meeting his wife, Audrey Robinson,
while training for the bar, but life as a secret agent beckoned and
after training with the FBI he moved to Washington to work with the
Bureau's espionage section.
The event that would forever immortalise him came in 1972, when
five men were arrested for breaking into the headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee.
Then the FBI's second in command, Felt led the investigation
into the burglary.
His leaking of information to Washington Post reporter Bob
Woodward, linking the White House to the scandal, would help win the
newspaper a Pullitzer Prize for its coverage, but for three decades Felt
insisted his name be kept out of it.
However, after years of denials, in 2005, Felt finally confessed to
being "Deep Throat" in an article for Vanity Fair magazine.
It was the final mystery of Watergate, which became the subject of
the best-selling book and hit movie All the President's Men. In the
film, the enduring image of Deep Throat is of a chain-smoking Hal
Holbrook telling Mr Woodward, played by Robert Redford, to "follow
the money".
Critics, including those who went to prison for the Watergate
scandal, called Felt a traitor for betraying the commander-in-chief.
However, supporters hailed him as a hero for blowing the whistle on a
corrupt administration trying to cover up attempts to sabotage
opponents.
Felt left the FBI in 1973 and five years later was indicted on
charges of authorising FBI break-ins at homes associated with suspected
bombers. President Ronald Reagan pardoned him in 1981 while the case was
on appeal - a move applauded by Nixon.
Felt, whose wife, Audrey, died in 1984, is survived by their two
children.
