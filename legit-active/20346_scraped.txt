YOUR LIFE ON MUTE
Record labels want to tax your free and local radio stations, threatening to silence the music that inspires some of life’s most perfect — and spontaneous — moments.
What happens when the music disappears? Do the moments and memories disappear, too?
KEEP RADIO FREE
FROM OPEN ROAD TO OPEN MIC
You dial into a station on a stretch of highway and hear the song that will spark this memory forever. The American road trip wouldn’t be the same if radio is changed.
AN UNEXPECTED SLOW DANCE
The right song can remind you to slow down and dance with the one you love, right now, while you still can. Spontaneous slow dances won’t happen without radio, and we all deserve moments like these.
Knowing When To Find Shelter
In emergency situations – floods, tornadoes, blizzards – local radio can save lives. Let’s sound the alarm on the performance fee to keep this public service alive.
THE ISSUE
Multinational record labels want Congress to impose a performance tax on free and local radio stations. Radio already pays millions of dollars a year in music royalties, but the labels want more.
What’s at stake? Your music moments. Don’t live your life on mute — say no to a tax on free radio.
