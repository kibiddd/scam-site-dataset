It's just too bad Lee's retrospective wasn't made with more care and better production values.
Rated: 3/5

Saw this ages ago.  It showed me a different side to Lee and how he was perceived by others.

It was a good documentary, but it used way too many recycled footage of past films/documentaries and I expected more from a movie released in 2002. Nothing really felt personal either and it provided nothing we didn't know already. 3/5
