I watched from atop an infield suite, overlooking the pit road entrance that the drivers and teams use when pushing their cars to and from the garage.It gave me a pretty good view of which drivers are fan friendly and which ones are not.A suggestion if you are an autograph seeker and plan onreturning to Michigan next year: line up along the fences on both sides of that entrance if you have a pit or infield pass because that’s a great time to catch the drivers.That’s where my 9-year old daughter and 6-year old son stood, and I was shocked with all the signatures they had cluttering their race program after the session.Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Trevor Bayne, David Ragan, David Reutimann and David Stremme all stopped to sign it. So did rookies Andy Lally and T.J. Bell and veteran Mike Skinner. Defending Camping World Truck champion Todd Bodine was kind enough to stop by as well.Edwards, who is tied for first place with Kyle Busch in the Sprint Cup points standings, and Gordon, a four-time Sprint Cup champion, spent the most time with the fans.It’s not surprising that Gordon is one of Sprint Cup’s good guys. He has been a class act since breaking into the series in 1993.You have seen Edwards hustle up into the grandstands and celebrate with the fans after he wins a race. You may wonder, is Edwards really that down with fans, or is he just a real savvy marketing guy in a driver’s suit?Well, I got my answer Friday. I saw a genuinely nice guy trying to be as accommodating as possible. Other prominent drivers signed, including Jimmie Johnson, Kevin Harvick and Marcus Ambrose. No one was as generous with their time as Edwards, though. Edwards signed autographs on both sides of the entrance.The driver I was most disappointed with was Juan Pablo Montoya. Many drivers didn’t sign as they were walking out to qualify, but they at least waved, nodded or smiled. Not Montoya. But I guess we should all cut him some slack. If I was 20th in the points standings, I wouldn’t be in a good mood, either.Maybe all drivers deserve some slack. They have team meetings to attend, sponsorship responsibilities and media obligations scheduled throughout the weekend. The track is their office, their factory, their classroom, and they have a job to do. Sometimes, they just don’t have time.That’s why I appreciate drivers such as Gordon and Edwards all the more. They made time.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
