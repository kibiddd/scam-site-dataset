Photo: NFL.com Fantasy Football Ad Starring Jamaal Charles Fair or Foul?
ByRobert Littal
Published September 22, 2011
I can not tell a lie.
I am addicted to Fantasy Football. I have been for the past the 8 years, but there is one thing I have never done.
I have never wished an injury on a player or have I ever forgotten that if a player is injured that they are human beings not just objects for our fantasy teams.
Yes, Jamaal Charles being hurt effected a lot of fantasy teams, but more importantly he has lost season and the Chiefs lost a valuable player.
Seems a bit insensitive by NFL.com to run an ad like this, to get more sign ups for their fantasy leagues. What is your take?
*UPDATE*
The NFL admitted the ad was in poor taste and has taken down the ad.
