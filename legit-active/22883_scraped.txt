Why choose Marianopolis?
Academic Excellence
We lay claim to an unmatched record of academic achievement. Marianopolis students tend to have the strongest R-Scores and the highest on-time graduation rate in Quebec, and they occupy more spots in several competitive university programs than all other Montreal colleges combined.
70% on-time graduation rate - double the average in the Quebec college network
Why choose Marianopolis?
Vibrant Community
Big enough to offer six pre-university DECs and three Double DECs to 2,000 students from over 170 high schools across the Montreal area. Small enough to provide personal attention to help you reach your full potential. At Marianopolis, you are not just a number; you are supported, inspired and challenged.
More than 150 student clubs and two 90-minute activity periods each week
Why choose Marianopolis?
