The impressive Mt. Ranier along with the Cascade and Olympic Mountains can be seen from the city. The Green River runs through the municipality and Lake Meridian is situated on the East Hill. The average annual rainfall is 39 inches.HistoryKent was incorporated in 1890 and was earlier known as Titusville. In 1906 the "Great Flood" temporarily changed the valley into an enormous lake. The Howard Hanson Dam was constructed at Eagle Gorge to prevent serious flooding in the future. The dam allowed extensive commercial development to take place in the valley which led to Kent becoming a primary distribution center. Before the extensive development took place in the 1960's and 1970's, the city was renowned for its fertile soil and was formerly known as the "Lettuce Capital of the World." Hops were also a major crop.AttractionsKent Station is a huge entertainment center which also includes retail businesses, and numerous restaurantsKent Cornucopia DaysKent Farmers MarketGreater Kent Historical Society Museum is an attractive three-story building and includes a large number of artifactsHydroplane & Race Boat Museum showcases a large number of vintage hydroplanesPacific Raceways International features drag races, motorcycle racing events, vintage car races and other motor sports eventsThe Museum of FlightEarthworksTransportationThe city is served by the Sea-Tac International Airport.
