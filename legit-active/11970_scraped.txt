At Triad Health Center, we believe that Corrective Chiropractic and true Functional Medicine are the future in preventative and regenerative health care.
Chiropractic CareChiropractic care for all ages as a vital part of your healthy lifestyle.Greensboro's Top Choice For Chiropractic Care
We offer a global full body, full spine approach and use a hands-on style of care. Our goal is to remove interference in the spine through corrective chiropractic adjustments and spinal rehab to allow the body to heal itself.
Functional MedicineGet well with a personalized approach that looks at the body as a whole.Diseases don’t exist. Not in the way you think.
The practice of Functional Medicine focuses on the mechanisms that are affected by our environment washing over our cells, creating downstream effects that we call “disease.” Instead of treating the symptom, heal the root cause!
Emotional Release TherapyRelease the burden of emotional trauma and be restored.Unlock joy, freedom, and happiness!
Overcome stuck emotions like anger, sadness, guilt, grief and hurt within both the mind and the body.  Releasing trapped emotions supports your body’s natural ability to heal itself!
