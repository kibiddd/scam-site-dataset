Hungary Davis Cup team
The Hungary Davis Cup team represents Hungary in Davis Cup tennis competition and are governed by the Hungarian Tennis Association.
History
First decades in Davis Cup (1924‚Äì1967)
Hungary competed in its first Davis Cup in 1924 and was stuck in the first round for 5 years (not counting an automatic bye). They broke the curse with the first and convincing 5-0 win against Norway realized by B√©la Von Kehrling in the major part. In the very next year in 1929 they cruised to their first semifinal losing to Great Britain in a close 3-2 (two singles absolved by Von Kehrling) falling only in the fifth rubber. It took another 20 years to relive the success in 1949 (including the 5-year vacancy period during the Second World War) this time losing to France in the semis. The core of the team was 1947 French Open champion J√≥zsef Asb√≥th. In 1956 Hungary was absent from the Cup because of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In 1966 a record attendance visited the Hungary-Great Britain quarterfinal in Budapest, where a crowd of 20.000 spectators supported the Andr√°s Szikszay-Istv√°n Guly√°s Davis Cup team during the 4-days tie. A tough weekend started on Saturday 14 May for the multiple champions Brits, who had 3-time Major semifinalist Mike Sangster losing their first match in 5 sets to Istv√°n Guly√°s. They turned to 2-1 on the same day but on Sunday Andr√°s Szikszay also defeated Sangster leaving the decision to the 5th final tie, which was postponed to Monday. In a four set match Guly√°s started well taking the first one 18-16, but Roger Taylor finished in 3 easier sets. English team captain Headley Baxter remarked that although they won but they hadn't been forced to so a tough fight for years. Just two weeks later Guly√°s had his first and lone Grand Slam final in the French Open losing only to Tony Roche of Australia.

Hungary (i/Ààh å≈ã…°…ôri/; Hungarian: Magyarorsz√°g [Ààm…í…ü…írorsaÀê…°]) is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is situated in the Carpathian Basin and is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. The country's capital and largest city is Budapest. Hungary is a member of the European Union, NATO, the OECD, the Visegr√°d Group, and the Schengen Area. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe.
Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince √Årp√°d in the Honfoglal√°s ("homeland-conquest"). His great-grandson Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000 CE, converting the country to a Christian kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the Western world, reaching a golden age by the 15th century. Following the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (1541‚Äì1699), Hungary came under Habsburg rule, and later formed a significant part of the Austro‚ÄìHungarian Empire (1867‚Äì1918).

Hungarian wine
Hungarian wine has a history dating back to at least Roman times. Outside of Hungary, the best-known wines are the white dessert wine Tokaji and the red wine Bull's Blood of Eger (Egri Bikav√©r).
Etymology
Only three European languages have words for wine that are not derived from Latin: Greek, Turkish and Hungarian. Records carved in a Runic alphabet used by ancient Hungarians have words for wine derived from Turkic. There are two hundred Hungarian words (including wine as well) that are of Bulgaro-Turkic origin, suggesting that the Magyars had contact with the first winemakers in the South Caucasus. Examples include¬†:
Sz≈ël≈ë: "grape"
Bor: "wine"
√Åszok: "cask"
√Åldom√°s: "blessing", "libation"
History
The Romans brought vines to Pannonia, and by the 5th century AD, there are records of extensive vineyards in Hungary. Following the Magyar invasion of 896, √Årp√°d rewarded his followers with vineyards in Tokaj. Over the following centuries, new grape varieties were brought in from Italy and France. Most of the production was of white wine.

Kingdom of Hungary (1920‚Äì46)
The Kingdom of Hungary (Hungarian: Magyar Kir√°lys√°g), also known as the Regency, existed from 1920 to 1946 as a de facto country under Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy. Horthy officially represented the Hungarian monarchy of Charles IV, Apostolic King of Hungary. Attempts by Charles IV to return to the throne were prevented by threats of war from neighbouring countries and by the lack of support from Horthy (see the conflict of Charles IV with Mikl√≥s Horthy).
The country has been regarded by some historians to have been a client state of Germany from 1938 to 1944.
The Kingdom of Hungary under Horthy was an Axis Power during most of World War II.  In 1944, after Horthy's government considered leaving the war, Hungary was occupied by Nazi Germany and Horthy was deposed. The Arrow Cross Party's leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi established a new Nazi-backed government, effectively turning Hungary into a German puppet state.
After World War II, Hungary fell within the Soviet Union's sphere of interest. In 1946, the Second Hungarian Republic was established under Soviet influence. In 1949, the communist Hungarian People's Republic was founded.

Davis Cup by BNP Paribas is the largest annual international team competition in world sport. This prestigious event, which is one of the cornerstones of the tennis calendar, gives players the chance to represent their country in an otherwise individual sport.
Founded by Dwight Davis in 1900, Davis Cup began as a challenge match between USA and British Isles, which was held at the Longwood Cricket Club in Boston.
Davis himself played in the inaugural Davis Cup tie, steering his country to the first of many title victories. USA has won the Davis Cup 32 times - more than any other nation.

Hungary Davis Cup team
The Hungary Davis Cup team represents Hungary in Davis Cup tennis competition and are governed by the Hungarian Tennis Association.
History
First decades in Davis Cup (1924‚Äì1967)
Hungary competed in its first Davis Cup in 1924 and was stuck in the first round for 5 years (not counting an automatic bye). They broke the curse with the first and convincing 5-0 win against Norway realized by B√©la Von Kehrling in the major part. In the very next year in 1929 they cruised to their first semifinal losing to Great Britain in a close 3-2 (two singles absolved by Von Kehrling) falling only in the fifth rubber. It took another 20 years to relive the success in 1949 (including the 5-year vacancy period during the Second World War) this time losing to France in the semis. The core of the team was 1947 French Open champion J√≥zsef Asb√≥th. In 1956 Hungary was absent from the Cup because of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In 1966 a record attendance visited the Hungary-Great Britain quarterfinal in Budapest, where a crowd of 20.000 spectators supported the Andr√°s Szikszay-Istv√°n Guly√°s Davis Cup team during the 4-days tie. A tough weekend started on Saturday 14 May for the multiple champions Brits, who had 3-time Major semifinalist Mike Sangster losing their first match in 5 sets to Istv√°n Guly√°s. They turned to 2-1 on the same day but on Sunday Andr√°s Szikszay also defeated Sangster leaving the decision to the 5th final tie, which was postponed to Monday. In a four set match Guly√°s started well taking the first one 18-16, but Roger Taylor finished in 3 easier sets. English team captain Headley Baxter remarked that although they won but they hadn't been forced to so a tough fight for years. Just two weeks later Guly√°s had his first and lone Grand Slam final in the French Open losing only to Tony Roche of Australia.
