Football Shirts
Last update: 18 March 2025
On Sunday 18th April 2021 Liverpool proudly announced that they were among the twelve founder members of the European Super League.
Overnight they effectively amended their motto of "This Means More" to "This Means More Money" and announced they were leaving the majority of the Premier League to walk alone.
On Tuesday 20th April 2021, after massive global objections, and ridicule, from fans, media, the clubs’ own players and management the club shamefacedly issued a barely apologetic statement and withdrew from the European Super League which was effectively disbanded after all of the English clubs did the same.
