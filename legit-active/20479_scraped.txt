Jonathan Coachman: Bio
Jonathan Coachman has had one of the most eclectic careers in broadcasting. The Coach made the leap from local sports anchor to WWE in 2000 as a lovable, enthusiastic young backstage interviewer who would often find a way to entertain WWE fans with his antics during interviews with Superstars such as The Rock. Later in 2002, Coachman took on another duty in addition to his backstage interviews. He became the lead announcer on Sunday Night Heat, working with such former Superstars as Al Snow, Lita and Tommy Dreamer as his rotating color commentators.
Coachman's broadcasting career took a turn during SummerSlam 2003 when he shocked everybody and sided with then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff over Shane McMahon. The move led to a change of attitude for Coachman, and he instantly began a crusade against Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler and "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.
In addition to his announcing duties, Coachman also held various authority roles, butted heads with Superstars like Austin and D-Generation X, and twice competed in the Royal Rumble Match.
Even with all that was on Coach's plate, WWE wasn't the only place he plied his trade. In the fall of 2005, Coachman also branched out into the world of sports play-by-play, calling football and basketball games for College Sports Television (now CBS Sports Network). He then began working as a host for the Madison Square Garden Network in New York.
In 2008, The Coach left WWE for ESPN but clearly never lost his love for sports-entertainment.
