Perfect Our favorite Kringle did not disappoint! So fresh, filled with nuts, flaky pastry, delicious icing. We were sad when it was gone!     Sharon McQuade    Pecan Danish Kringle 22oz    12/11/2020         Apricot kringle I sent it as a gift.  They said it was. ..good, but not exceptional.  Sorry.     Pamela Perry    Apricot Danish Kringle 22oz.    12/09/2020         Excellent Products and Service I ordered one Kringle and your 7 Sisters Coffee Cake the week of Thanksgiving and received them the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Best 7 Sisters Coffee Cake I have had from West Racine bakeries.  Thank you     Jonathan Krein    Seven Sisters coffee cake with coffee packet    12/07/2020         Wonderful Kringle Sent my father a pecan Kringle as he is in MI and I am in TX and we could not be together for Thanksgiving. The Kringle arrived in perfect condition as it was packaged very well. My father said it was flakey and extremely tasty. Everyone enjoyed having it for dinner.     Deanne Christensen    Pecan Danish Kringle 22oz    12/02/2020          Absolutely awesome.     Alan Patterson    Raspberry Danish Kringle 22oz.    12/02/2020         Wonderful Kringle :) / USPS slow :( This was our first order with Larsen's Bakery.  Kringle did not disappoint!! However the shipping (USPS) took 4 days to deliver less than 150 miles.  Its called snail mail for a reason....!     Ross S    Almond Danish Kringle 22oz.    12/01/2020         excelllent, as always! If i lived in Racine, i would be in here every day and eat nothing else!!     Joanne Yousten    Raspberry Danish Kringle 22oz.    11/25/2020         Best Kringle Kringle has been part of our winter holiday celebrations for decades, and Larsen's has always been there for us.  Even though now we live far away, the Kringle ships well (when USPS has their act together) and freezes well.     R Zook    3 Pack Bakers Pride    11/23/2020         Cherry Kringle The cherry kringle is awesome and a family favorite!!     Linda Geer    Cherry Danish Kringle 22oz.    11/23/2020          Always great to treat the kids with Kringle from Larsen's Bakery. Everything was delivered timely and enjoyed.     Jeffrey Harrington    Coffee, 2oz. package of Colectivo Coffee    11/21/2020         Kringle There was a problem with the order being filled correctly.  When I called to let you know the problem, you were quick to send the cherry that had been omitted. Will always order from Larson's because you have to best kringle and customer service.     Linda Geer    Customer Favorite Two Pack    11/16/2020         Kringle The Kringle was delicious as usual.  I just didn’t like that I was charged more than the advertised price for a 2 pack.     Eloda Linehan    Select Kringle.    11/16/2020         Great Pecan Flavor The pecan dreams taste like how they look!  Dry and crumbly pastry with a nice amount of pecan flavor.  Pecan pieces are chopped small and fit in well.  Covered with a good amount of powdered sugar but are not too sweet.  A more sophisticated European tasting pastry.  My family loves them.  They came very well packaged with no damage at all and delivery was quite fast.     Lisa T    Pecan Dreams    11/15/2020         Best Crescents Anywhere! Both the almond and the poppy seed crescents are excellent.  Beautiful flaky dough, the fillings are flavorful but not too sweet.  They are really a taste of Europe.  We drive from Chicago to buy them.  Now have turned to ordering because of the lockdown.  The web site makes it easy to order, they arrive well packaged and in good shape.  Larsen's crescents are the best!  My family highly recommends them.     Lisa T    Almond & Poppy Seed Crescents    11/09/2020         Kringle lover I thought that once I went vegan I would never be able to have Kringle again — boy was I wrong. Larsen’s Bakery not only bakes a vegan Kringle, but excelles in every way. I cant wait to try every flavor you have!     Rachelle W    Customer Favorite Two Pack    10/24/2020
