Moshpit Tragedy Records - sliding scale download label
Posted on January 29, 2008 by Guest Music Blogger
Canada's Moshpit Tragedy Records, who has abandoned releasing cds in favour of letting their listeners download albums for as much or as little as they like and claims to be the first record label to provide albums using this new sliding scale rate, has already caught the attention and support of several key figures involved with the music industry.
"I'm down with what Moshpit Tragedy is doing 100%," stated Mike Williams (EYEHATEGOD and ARSON ANTHEM vocalist). "Younger, newer underground bands need to be heard and noticed in these modern digital days without signing their lives away to some bloodsucking record label right outta the gate. It's a very honorable and DIY way to get things done."
OZZY OSBOURNE bassist Rob 'Blasko' Nicholson (whose favorite bands on the label includes THE SKUDS, HULLUUS and FILTHPACT) even goes so far as to say "This model could very well be the future of all indie labels." Co-founder Rayny Forster agrees, "RADIOHEAD and NIN have done a similar thing, so we just took that and tried to improve upon it."
Staying true to their motto 'Burning down the record industry' in an increasingly digital age means taking advantage of falling CD sales and disillusionment with big-name record labels.
In a recent interview in Metal Edge, MOTORHEAD mainman Lemmy Kilmister says "It's killing itself, isn't it? I mean, they (record companies) are too dumb to realise. They just kept on overcharging and kept on f@!*ing people over, and now the chickens are coming home, you know? I think they're all gonna be out of business in 10 years."
Soon announcements will be made regarding some major bands who are already known and loved by many, who have chosen to join them in this campaign against paying too much for music.
