Draft Profile: Marshon Brooks
Draft Express.com has updated their mock draft and now have Marshon Brooks as the Boston Celtics pick at 25 in the first round of this year's draft.
Brooks finished his senior season at Providence as the nation’s second leading scorer with an average of 24.6 points per game.
At 6'5", 195 pounds Brooks is a natural shooting guard who actually shoots pretty well and can score by creating his own shot off the dribble. His 7’1” wing span is put to great use as Brooks averaged 7 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.2 blocks. Very high averages for a shooting guard. Scoring is obviously something teams covet but being versatile is the key to a lengthy NBA career and Brooks has proven to be that in college.
Players entering the draft are often compared to a current or semi-current player in the NBA and with Brooks the comparisons are vast. Jordan Crawford, Nick Young, Josh Howard, and even the great Kobe Bryant are some of the names being thrown around in relation to Brooks. Before we fall off our chair with laughter, the Kobe comparisons were made more in reference to the demeanor/swag of Brooks rather than play on the court.  Draft Express also made mention to Paul George which is the player I would most think Brooks resembles now down to their body types.
Having played in arguably the nation’s best conference in the Big East, Brooks has faced his fare share of quality competition. Unfortunately, his teams have not fared nearly as well as he has individually.  That said he is great off the dribble and handles the ball better than most shooting guards. His “herky-jerky” motion allows for a great hesitation dribble and surprisingly effective cross over. He has good body control and is able to finish at odd angles when help defense comes to stop him. With averages of 48% from the floor and 34% from three, scoring should not be a problem for Brooks at the next level. He has the physical gifts to be a pesky defender and despite average quickness his length allows him to block shots from the weak side and at times from behind if he gets beat.
On the negative side, despite having long arms he doesn’t have a high release on his shot. Brooks is not a great leaper and will have to use his good body control to finish around the more talented bigs in the NBA. He will need to get a bit bulkier to be able to finish with contact in the league. The offense at Providence was centered around him, so he hasn’t had to make players around him better in a while now. There are also some questions about his attitude. Third person references and a strong bravado have steered some scouts and GMs away.
At the draft combine a few weeks ago Brooks was on his best behavior and seemed like a player who wants to fit into whatever system he is drafted into. He also makes clear mention to eventually becoming a big time player at some point and I don’t think he should be faulted for that desire.
Although some teams have been turned off by his perceived attitude, others are chomping at the bit to acquire him. The stock of Brooks is on the rise and the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers are rumored to be trying to get another pick in the first round with Brooks as their target. The Charlotte Bobcats are also rumored to be interested with the 19th pick and that probably is a good fit based on their need. Brooks would challenge for a starting role immediately but paring him with Stephen Jackson just doesn’t seem like the best idea.
We here at Celtics Life all want the best for our team and have differing opinions on what the immediate team need is. Rebounding and bench scoring are at the top of my list. Brooks is a capable rebounder and could be a great scoring option off the bench. I think he would be a steal at 25 and I trust Doc Rivers would able to keep whatever ego Brooks may have in check.
