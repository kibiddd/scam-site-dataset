He was quite a snappy dancer and in 1958 won a Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship.Crazy credits"The void is that which stands right in the middle of 'this' and 'that'. The void is all-inclusive, having no opposite - there is nothing which it excludes or opposes. It is a living void, because all forms come out of it and whoever realizes the void is filled with life and power and the love of all things." Bruce Lee "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do"ConnectionsEdited into Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do (1995)User reviews14ReviewFeatured reviewAn interesting movie for Bruce Lee fans and othersThe film that would make me a life long fan of Bruce Lee, who died two years before my birth.  Although my further studies would later prove this documentary to be a little underdeveloped and one-sided, but those who are willing to suspend their disbelief might find this to be an interesting watch. Golden Harvest truly knows how to immortalize its former star.kenneymljkenDec 12, 2000PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ13How long is Bruce Lee, the Legend?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease date1984 (Hong Kong)Country of originHong KongLanguageEnglishAlso known asBruce Lee: Die LegendeProduction companiesGolden Harvest CompanyParagon Films Ltd.See more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 28 minutesColorColorSound mixMonoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Bruce Lee, the Legend (1984) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
