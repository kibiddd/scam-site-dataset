Carnevale
began in the ancient port city of Venice in the Middle Ages
when the great squares of the city were turned over to aristocratic
pageantry, public sport competitions, and performances by roving
minstrels and actors. For a few hundred years the Carnival in
Venice grew and flourished with more and more elaborate costumes
and lavish events. Political and religious reformers of the
18th and 19th centuries eventually curbed the excesses of this
festival. By the early 20th century Venice Carnival had stopped
being celebrated altogether.
In 1981 city officials decided
to revive Venice Carnival as a reincarnation of the aristocratic
festival it had once been. Characters from the 16th, 17th ,
and 18th -century Italian theater reappeared on the streets,
along with masqueraders portraying counts and countesses and
other legendary figures. Today Venice carnevale is open
to everyone and participants come from many countries and a
range of social backgrounds to take on the identity of classical
personages and a variety of fantasy characters. Some pay to
have elaborate outfits made for them, others create their own,
but many participants rent their costumes for a few brief hours.
The masqueraders slowly make their way through the narrow streets
of Venice and across the bridges wrapped in a thin layer of
fog. Others ride through the canals in gondolas decorated for
the festive occasion.

Some of the masquerades worn
in Venice Carnival today are characters from the famous 16th
and 17th -century Italian theater, commedia dell'arte. Arlecchino
(Harlequin) played the role of a faithful valet - patient, trusting,
passionate, and playful. His costume is decorated with brightly
colored triangles and diamonds and his black half mask has tiny
eyeholes and quizzically arched eyebrows accentuated by a wrinkled
forehead.

The Doctor of the Plague masquerade features a
white mask with a long beak and spectacles, a black cape, collar,
hat, white gloves, and stick. The origin of this costume can
be traced to a 16th -century French doctor, Charles de Lorme,
who adopted bizarre sanitary precautions before visiting patients
infected with the plague. Dressed in a doctor's outfit, he wore
a mask with a long, bird-like nose filled with herbs and other
perfumes to protect him from the contagious disease. He also
carried a stick so he didn't need to touch the patients with
his own hands.

Today Venice carnevale
lasts for a two-week period leading up to Lent. During this
time, hundreds of thousands of people come from all over the
world to enjoy the celebration. For many it is an annual pilgrimage
and much of the year is spent in preparing their elaborate masquerades.
Showing off a costume against the backdrop of Venetian architecture
and posing for photographers is part of Carnival play in Venice.

The large piazza in front of the church
of St. Mark serves as center stage for many Venetian Carnival
activities, including processions where masqueraders compete
with one another for the most authentic or eccentric creations.
The historic costumes range from 17th -century Asian and Venetian
merchants to 18th -century counts and countesses.
