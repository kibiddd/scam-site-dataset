I refuse to get rid of it as it does have quite a good soundtrack. Ignoring the implausible plot, and some of the acting performances, it is quite watchable.The actual dancers, apart from Lamas are really good. I saw both the break dancing (Shabba Doo) films before this, so I was expecting something along the lines of that. I didn't get it. But I have grown to appreciate this film over the years, especially as the 80's seem to have come back in vogue now. Years after these films were made, you can start to see their charm and often become cult favourites. I also love Dance Acadamy (quite an underground film), Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Getting Physical and The Laker Girls, to name but a few.If you should come across it, watch it, tape it, buy it...collect it as a keep-sake, a great moment in time... ...because they sure don't make them like this anymore!felicia-blakeDec 12, 2006PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ18How long is Body Rock?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 28, 1984 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asGraffiti rockFilming locationsNew York, USAProduction companyNew World PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross US & Canada$1,689,501Opening weekend US & Canada$631,849Sep 30, 1984Gross worldwide$1,689,501See detailed box office info on IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 33 minutesColorColorSound mixDolbyAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Body Rock (1984) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
