2007 Season 2007 regular season record: 5-32007 regular season standings: second place in QSSF2007 playoff record: 1-12007 playoff finish: lost to Laval Rouge et Or by a score of 35-10 in the Dunsmore Cup game. Head Coach: Gerry McGrath - Number of seasons as head coach with team (including 2008): 9- Number of seasons as head coach in CIS (including 2008): 9- Career regular season record with team: 41-23- Career regular season record in CIS: 41-23- Career overall record with team (reg. season & playoffs only): 46-30- Career overall record in CIS (reg. season & playoffs only): 46-30 2008 Overview There’s an air quiet of optimism surrounding the 2008 Concordia Stingers football program, but at the same time there are some big question marks going into the start of the season. On defence, the front seven is in great shape and some say it is even stronger than the dominating units powered by the likes of LB Patrick Donovan (President’s Trophy 2005, 2006), LB Mickey Donovan (President’s Trophy 2004) and DT Sammy Taulealea. It is an experienced group; four of the seven are fifth-year veterans. It will be very hard to establish a running game against the Stingers. “We’re going to play aggressive and take advantage of our strength in the front,” says defensive co-ordinator Warren Craney. “We’ve had a strong year of recruiting at defensive back. It will be interesting to watch their progress.” The question marks all hang over the defensive backfield where youth and athleticism are the name of the game. How fast can the younger members adapt to the CIS level? Who will step up to fill the spot left by the graduation of three-time all-Canadian halfback Sammy Okpro? (now with Edmonton Eskimos). Head coach Gerry McGrath is expecting to put “an explosive” offence on the field in 2008. A big, veteran offensive line will give him some latitude. Quarterback Liam Mahoney, the 2008 CIS rookie of the year, is back at the helm. Since he only ran the team for four games last season, it will be interesting to see what he can do with a whole season to work with. McGrath also has a lot of talent at the skilled positions. “We’ll be physical,” says the veteran coach. “We have a lot of weapons, especially at receiver. The offensive line is outstanding. Games are won and lost along the line and we will be very good on both sides of the ball. “I expect we will run a balanced attack. I’m really excited about the crew we have.” On special teams, all-star kicker Rene Parades is back for his second year. J.P. Binette is back at long snap. Some new faces will get playing time on returns. Overall, 19 of 25 starters (includes kicker) are back in the fold. Even with some changes, McGrath feels the team has reloaded and is ready to fight for the top spot in Quebec.  Offence Key returning players: OG Kristian Matte (St. Hubert, Que.) is a third-year player. He brings a lot of size (6’4”, 308 lbs.) and leadership to the line. He was named the Stingers’ outstanding lineman at their 2007 football banquet. SB Cory Watson (Dollard des Ormeaux, Que.) is a third-year inside receiver. He led the Stingers with 24 receptions for 366 yards and five touchdowns in 2007. Watson will lead a talented group of receivers for which head coach Gerry McGrath has high expectations. QB Liam Mahoney (Lachine, Que.) is a second-year quarterback who was the 2007 CIS rookie of the year. In just over four games he completed 60.2 per cent of his passes and threw for six touchdowns. He also rushed for more than 600 yards, averaging more than eight yards a carry. With veteran Rob Mackay on the sidelines this season, Mahoney is the uncontested starter.  SB Corey Greenaway (Vaudreuil, Que.) is a third-year player who will move from running back to receiver this season. The Stingers hope to exploit his speed and good hands. McGrath has a lot of faith in Greenaway who was MVP offence of his CEGEP team in 2005 (Edouard Montpetit) and a key player for Team Canada in 2006.
