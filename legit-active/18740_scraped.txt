Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of Osborne House Review
by deux michaels
22 September 2010
GoNintendoGN Version 3.1
A portion of the Cubed3 review:
C3 Score Whilst Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy was a fun 3D investigative adventure, this latest effort, Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of Osborne House, fails to mimic the extremely popular Professor Layton series. Whilst moderately engaging for hardcore puzzle fans, it does not really live up to expectations or fulfill its potential.
