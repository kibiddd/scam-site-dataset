Vincent Church Cemetery
Vincent Church
Cemetery
Highway 238, Bee Spring,
KY
Take
Highway 238 northwest, 0.7 mile, from Bee Springs to Vincent
Church.
Turn left, just past the church, onto Vincent Cemetery Road ,
0.2 mile.
The cemetery is located on the right and is enclosed by a fence.
This
cemetery was probably established in the 1880's
since the earliest recorded death is in 1886.
Concrete markers, presumably
for graves, are scattered throughout
this cemetery, and will be duly noted in each row.
