Snorkeling in Ishigaki-jima and Iriomote-jima in November?
13 years ago

We are thinking of going to these islands in mid to late November and wonder whether the water will be calm enough for snorkeling --- and warm enough so that we won't need wetsuits.
Any advice that you can give us would be most appreciated!

Although I do not snorkeling, the water temperature information is available in the following Japanese page: In November, the water temperature is 27C (80F) max, and 24C (’75F) min. Mid November is the end of summer, local people begin to wear long sleeve shirts. However, you, guys from Boston will stick to T-shirts.

Weather is fully depend upon if Typhoon coming to that area, normally in November, Typhoon is never attack the island, I am not sure.
English page does not help you much.

Have been to Ishigaki and Iriomote about 40 years ago by small boats. Mangrove forests in the Iriomote ocean front was very impressive: today, things are changed, but hopefully they still have nature.

Hi I am also thinking about going to Ishigaki-jima and Iriomote-jima late november but I can only spare 3 or 4 days max out of my itinerary do you think it is worth it or should I aim for some of the islands closer to Okinawa? Its quite a bit more expensive to get out to Ishigaki as opposed to Naha and I am wondering if it is worth it. I want to swim, snorkel and relax on stunning beaches and do quite a bit of nature walking.

Thanks, Sanfran1946 --- that is very helpful. You're right : We Bostonians will probably still be wearing T-shirts and fanning ourselves!
