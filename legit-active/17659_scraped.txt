Queen Elizabeth Hotel
The Queen Elizabeth Hotel (French: Le Reine √âlizabeth; official English name Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth) is a  grand hotel in Montreal, Quebec.
Building
Completed in 1958, the hotel was built by the Canadian National Railway and managed for many years by Hilton Hotels. CN Hotels were later sold to Canadian Pacific Hotels, which is now known as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. With 1039 rooms and 21 floors it is the largest hotel in the province of Quebec, and the second largest Fairmont hotel in Canada after the Royal York in Toronto, which has 1365 rooms.
Located at 900 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard West, in the heart of Montreal, it is connected to Central Station and to the underground city.
Canadian National Railway selected leading architects and designers to give the interior decoration a "New France" theme, using Quebec handicrafts.
The artists included Albert Edward Cloutier (carved wooden panels), Jean Dallaire (wall hanging), Marius Plamondon (stained glass mural), Claude Vermette (ceramic tiles) and Julien H√©bert (bronze elevator doors).
Cloutier painted a mural for the main dining room of the Salle Bonaventure in the hotel.

The Queen Mother with her great grandson, Prince William #princewilliam #queenmother #royalty #uk
Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Prince William represent two distinct generations of the British royal family. The Queen Mother, born in 1900, witnessed significant historical events, including both World Wars and the transformation of the monarchy throughout the 20th century.

Her influence can be seen in William's approach to his duties and his emphasis on family values. Both have shown a deep commitment to their roles within the monarchy while fostering strong familial bonds.

After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom, she was also still the leader of an organization that on a map looks a lot like the British Empire.
The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the ...

Queen Elizabeth II in her own words | 1947
In one of her most famous speeches, then Princess Elizabeth addressed the Commonwealth from Cape Town, South Africa, on her 21st birthday.
"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."
Her life, as it turned out, would be long.
She died Thursday at the age of 96, after serving 70 years on the throne ‚Äî longer than any other British monarch in history.

Remember when the Queen got the Giggles with Soldiers in Scotland?
The Queen visited soldiers while on a visit to Fife, Scotland. She joked about their berets, asking one, ‚ÄúDo you keep it on the whole time, or does it blow off?‚Äù
The soldier looked confused and replied: ‚ÄúErm, it‚Äôs supposed to stay on

After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom, she was also still the leader of an organization that on a map looks a lot like the British Empire.
The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So, what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?
Correction: A previous version of this video mistakenly showed Myanmar as a member of the Commonwealth on a 1994 map, mislabeled Sierra Leone and Gold Coast for a brief moment on a 1927 map, and omitted Greenland, all of which have now been corrected.
We have also clarified that India became a republic shortly after independence with a new line of narration at 3:12; corrected Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs title at 00:16 and 00:47; and updated the date Barbados became a republic from November 29, 2021, to November 30, 2021.

Queen Elizabeth II's Funniest Moments
'Queen Elizabeth II's Funniest Moments'
Britain‚Äôs monarch is many things - she‚Äôs strong, she‚Äôs sensible, and at times she‚Äôs even stoic. But royal fans will also know the Queen has quite the sense of humour.
She had the nation howling when she became a Bond girl, by starring in a skit for the 2012 Olympics.
Three years later, she gave Justin Trudeau a piece of her mind after the Canadian prime minister reminded her that he‚Äôs the 12th PM to serve during her reign.
But it was someone else‚Äôs years of service that were the butt of the joke in 2021, when Her Majesty met the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery at Windsor Castle.

She had the nation howling when she became a Bond girl, by starring in a skit for the 2012 Olympics.
Three years later, she gave Justin Trudeau a piece of her mind after the Canadian prime minister reminded her that he‚Äôs the 12th PM to serve during her reign.
But it was someone else‚Äôs years of service that were the butt of the joke in 2021, when Her Majesty met the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery at Windsor Castle.

Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Prince William represent two distinct generations of the British royal family. The Queen Mother, born in 1900, witnessed significant historical events, including both World Wars and the transformation of the monarchy throughout the 20th century. In contrast, Prince William, born in 1982, embodies the modern royal family, navigating contemporary issues while maintaining royal traditions.
As the great-grandmother of Prince William, the Queen Mother played a significant role in shaping his understanding of royal responsibilities. Her influence can be seen in William's approach to his duties and his emphasis on family values. Both have shown a deep commitment to their roles within the monarchy while fostering strong familial bonds.

After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom, she was also still the leader of an organization that on a map looks a lot like the British Empire.
The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So, what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?
Correction: A previous version of this video mistakenly showed Myanmar as a member of the Commonwealth on a 1994 map, mislabeled Sierra Leone and Gold Coast for a brief moment on a 1927 map, and omitted Greenland, all of which have now been corrected.
We have also clarified that India became a republic shortly after independence with a new line of narration at 3:12; corrected Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs title at 00:16 and 00:47; and updated the date Barbados became a republic from November 29, 2021, to November 30, 2021.

In one of her most famous speeches, then Princess Elizabeth addressed the Commonwealth from Cape Town, South Africa, on her 21st birthday.
"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."
Her life, as it turned out, would be long.
She died Thursday at the age of 96, after serving 70 years on the throne ‚Äî longer than any other British monarch in history.

Queen Elizabeth Hotel
The Queen Elizabeth Hotel (French: Le Reine √âlizabeth; official English name Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth) is a  grand hotel in Montreal, Quebec.
Building
Completed in 1958, the hotel was built by the Canadian National Railway and managed for many years by Hilton Hotels. CN Hotels were later sold to Canadian Pacific Hotels, which is now known as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. With 1039 rooms and 21 floors it is the largest hotel in the province of Quebec, and the second largest Fairmont hotel in Canada after the Royal York in Toronto, which has 1365 rooms.
Located at 900 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard West, in the heart of Montreal, it is connected to Central Station and to the underground city.
Canadian National Railway selected leading architects and designers to give the interior decoration a "New France" theme, using Quebec handicrafts.
The artists included Albert Edward Cloutier (carved wooden panels), Jean Dallaire (wall hanging), Marius Plamondon (stained glass mural), Claude Vermette (ceramic tiles) and Julien H√©bert (bronze elevator doors).
Cloutier painted a mural for the main dining room of the Salle Bonaventure in the hotel.

'Queen Elizabeth II's Funniest Moments'
Britain‚Äôs monarch is many things - she‚Äôs strong, she‚Äôs sensible, and at times she‚Äôs even stoic. But royal fans will also know the Queen has quite the sense of humour.
She had the nation howling when she became a Bond girl, by starring in a skit for the 2012 Olympics.
Three years later, she gave Justin Trudeau a piece of her mind after the Canadian prime minister reminded her that he‚Äôs the 12th PM to serve during her reign.
But it was someone else‚Äôs years of service that were the butt of the joke in 2021, when Her Majesty met the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery at Windsor Castle.
