It was also my good fortune to have spent some time with him, sippin’ a beer or two, sharing tall tales from our past – one of the stories he told was about throwing dry ice into the officer’s club pool, just as Mary, his co-conspirator, related earlier in this guest book.Paul was a real hoot.  But, more than that, I know he was a good man.  It was my pleasure to have known him these past few years.  He was loved and he will be missed.I’ve uploaded a short video from a poker game in 2007.

RIP.Gary LeifferJuly 9, 2010Paul was a true friend and great poker player. We nicknamed him affectionately "Speedy" and not because he played that way! I've been trying his cell for over a month especially because he was back with us for a few weeks and then didnt appear at our final table...... He will be missed and so sorry I didnt google and find this notice until now- I would have definitely been to there to pay respects..... Gary (Leiffer)[email protected]Pat ChesowskyJuly 2, 2010RIP PaulYour friend Pat Chesowsky, AtlantaMary HyslopJune 18, 2010I remember Paul so well from growing up: He took me VERY HIGH in a tree at Fort Leavenworth, to his tree house; we would throw dry ice into the swimming pool at the officers club, just to watch the bubbling. My brother Paul took a picture of him about 30 years ago, which we always called "the electric hair picture": the light came from behind, and the face was framed by this "mane" of hair. When my mom died, it was him I got on the phone when I called to tell his father about it. He will be missed.Mary HyslopShowing 1 - 5 of 5 resultsMake a Donation in Paul Gleason's nameMemorial Events for Paul GleasonTo offer your sympathy during this difficult time, you can now have memorial trees planted in a National Forest in memory of your loved one.Plant TreesPlant TreesHow to support Paul's loved onesHonor a beloved veteran with a special tribute of ‘Taps’ at the National WWI Memorial in Washington, D.C.The nightly ceremony in Washington, D.C. will be dedicated in honor of your loved one on the day of your choosing.Read moreAttending a Funeral: What to KnowYou have funeral questions, we have answers.Read moreShould I Send Sympathy Flowers?What kind of arrangement is appropriate, where should you send it, and when should you send an alternative?Read moreWhat Should I Write in a Sympathy Card?We'll help you find the right words to comfort your family member or loved one during this difficult time.Read moreView AllResources to help you cope with lossEstate Settlement GuideIf you’re in charge of handling the affairs for a recently deceased loved one, this guide offers a helpful checklist.Read moreHow to Write an ObituaryNeed help writing an obituary?
