I had the pleasure of working with David, a skilled construction recruiter, who utilized his exceptional talent acquisition skills to help me land an amazing job in NYC over five years ago.
With his extensive industry knowledge and network, David took the time to understand my career goals and aspirations, and then leveraged his expertise to match me with a fantastic opportunity that perfectly aligned with my skills and interests.
His ability to understand the needs of both employers and candidates alike allowed him to bridge the gap between the two, resulting in a seamless and successful job placement.
David's tireless efforts and attention to detail made the entire process smooth and stress-free, and I'm grateful for his guidance and support throughout the journey.

Manhattan Financial Firm Revamps Office for Modern Collaboration
A financial firm in Manhattan’s midtown is modernizing its office to upgrade interiors and introduce collaborative workplace strategies. This renovation focuses on sustainable materials and advanced telecommunications to enhance the firm's investment expertise and company culture.
Reimagining branding strategies, the firm will integrate state-of-the-art technologies for a stimulating, media-rich environment. This approach aims to foster creativity, innovation, and collaboration among employees.
The interior design will feature a curated palette of materials, colors, and artwork to create an upscale yet tranquil atmosphere, counteracting the intensity of investment workflows and promoting efficiency and wellness.
Architectural studio Edwin A. Lee, A.I.A, Architect, known for their corporate workspace expertise, is leading the project. Their attention to detail ensures the new office meets current needs and anticipates future industry changes.
In summary, the renovation will transform the firm's office into a cutting-edge, collaborative workspace, enhancing investment expertise and fostering a collaborative culture with the help of Edwin A. Lee, A.I.A, Architect.

To diversify housing options and address delays in constructing multifamily projects, Greystar has launched Modern Living Solutions, a modular construction business and subsidiary, focused on delivering housing at stable and attainable price points.
My colleague Ryan Souls and I recently spoke with Boston Business Journal about Greystar’s plans to build a modular multifamily complex in Taunton, which upon completion, would be one of the largest modular projects in the state. I am proud to see Greystar using its leadership in the multifamily space in Massachusetts and nationwide to introduce new products for increasing housing production. Recognizing the immense need for housing, modular builds can deliver housing at nearly twice the speed of conventional multifamily projects while keeping costs within a feasible range.
Modular won’t replace traditional construction, but it is a fantastic complement and is a great fit for large project sites and scenarios where housing needs to be built in an accelerated timeframe. It presents us with the opportunity to get “heads on beds sooner,” which has never been more critical, given the housing crisis in the Commonwealth.
I am looking forward to seeing how the development community can utilize modular housing to create a large-scale impact on the U.S. housing supply, and how modular can spur multifamily development in Greater Boston.

Listen to Mary Anne Tighe, CEO CBRE New York Tri-State Region, as she discusses Manhattan’s on-going transformation.
Key takeaways from this week’s episode (from CBRE):
1. Anticipated Market Transformation: Investors should prepare for a major shift in New York’s office market, reminiscent of the historic changes that occurred in the 1920s.
2. Long-Term Leases: Despite the rise of remote work, many New York City businesses want to sign long-term leases due to the high costs and complexities of space renovation.
3. Investment Opportunities: New York has significant opportunities to convert antiquated office buildings into residential or mixed-use properties.
4. Government Incentives: Understanding and leveraging government tax incentives can be crucial in making redevelopment projects financially viable.
5. Cultural Edge: New York’s creative energy and foremost cultural and social amenities remain a strong draw for people, businesses and capital. This enables the City’s resilience and continuous evolution.

“Multifamily developers recognize that smart #multifamily construction is attractive to multiple potential renters or buyers…As impactful as these spaces can be, they still must be financially viable to construct,” Michael Scott writes in the Boston Business Journal. In this op-ed, Mike discusses how any community that wants to contribute to the long-term economic competitiveness of #Massachusetts must consider creative strategies to drive down project cost, lower risk, and support financially viable projects.

⚡ Highlight news: Manhattan’s office market is shrinking, with 7M sf of space disappearing as buildings are converted to residential use. This shift is driving tenants to relocate to other office buildings, which will help lower the availability rate.
🚨 However, there’s another key factor at play that won’t show up in the numbers: landlords giving back buildings to lenders. With lenders often taking a year to decide whether to sell or hold, these spaces may sit idle, further affecting availability in ways not immediately visible.

Midtown Manhattan's offices are making a comeback! After a rough patch, the market's bouncing back better than anyone expected.
The urge for top-quality spaces, a shrinking supply of prime offices, and Midtown’s legacy as the heart of NYC’s business hub fuel a recovery many other cities can only dream of. 🙏
"The activity we’re seeing highlights the strength of Manhattan’s office leasing market," says Danny Mangru. Leasing activity has surged 25% YoY with availability rates steadily dropping.
In fact, we recently reported that 23.1 msf of office space was leased in Manhattan in Q3, a 25% increase compared to last year. Midtown led the way with the most significant YoY growth in office "busyness," as more workers returned to their swivel chairs. 🪑

EXPANSIVE
Andrea Pirrotti-Dranchak (MBA), Expansive's Managing Director, recently sat down with Sarah Maffei (Momberg), Vice President at Foundry Commercial, to discuss the evolution of commercial real estate needs and strategies that are used to ensure both immediate and long-term objectives of businesses are met when considering all of the workspace options available today.
"Before COVID commercial real estate was simpler. Typically, you’d calculate your space based on headcount. Now, it’s not about having a desk for every person and enough room for private offices. It’s more about collaborative spaces. Some still want a dedicated desk, but most people come to the office to work together. So, offices are focusing more on shared spaces rather than individual offices, which used to be the norm."
