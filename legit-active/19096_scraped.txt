Event Details
On the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month from 6:00 p.m. until 7:30 p.m., those of us who are practicing learning French get together for dinner and practice (This is a change from our former routine of meeting every other Tuesday).
We really need help with this ministry. It has grown beyond what we originally envisioned. We need someone to coordinate the event overseeing the set-up, meal serving, and clean-up. We also need a teacher – or at least someone to help us develop lesson plans. If you feel called to help with either of these needs, please contact Rev. Susan at sbrasier@standrewstpaul.com.

Event Details
You are cordially invited to a special Lunch and Learn to be held immediately after church on April 6th in Kildonan Hall. The Rev. Dr. Rick Fee will be presenting “The Story of Canairelief”. As Rev. Fee stated, “The Biafran crisis, caused by civil war in Nigeria (1967-1970) killed two million people. This was a time when Canada came together with amazing passion; and it was deeply appreciated, for Canairelief helped provide relief to millions who were starving.” Stay tuned for more info about this upcoming Lunch and Learn where we will learn about humble and caring Canadians who stepped forward to help others. It was and always will be a proud moment in Canadian history. Presented by the Ministry Committee of The Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul.

This Sunday, we are delighted to welcome Elizabeth Cumming, daughter of Michelle Samson and Patrick Cumming, into our family of faith through the celebration of baptism. As we take on the responsibility of nurturing her in faith, we will reflect on the parable of the fig tree and explore what happens when God serves as the gardener, tending to and nurturing a vineyard.

In this week’s scripture, Jesus calls the ancient ruler, Herod Antipas, a predatory fox while comparing God to a protective mother hen. In a world filled with pitfalls and perils, God still longs to provide shelter for us under her wings. As we continue our Lenten journey towards Easter, so we continue to journey with Jesus towards Jerusalem.Sermon by The Rev. Susan Brasier, "Today, tomorrow, and the next day"Watch the live service on YouTube: buff.ly/sWq1MSg

In the midst of our hectic lives, many people long for the peace and refreshment that only God can give. Our Taizé Service offers the chance to gather quietly in meditative common prayer using the beautiful and simple songs of the Taizé community in France. Serene and uplifting, the music of Taizé helps us to deepen our sense of prayer and of God’s presence. On Wednesday, March 19th, at 6:00 p.m., all are welcome to this quiet and simple service.
