Tom Henke: All-Star
By Toronto Mike ‚Ä¢

I'm featuring 1988 Topps Cards featuring members of my beloved Blue Jays that are featured on this blog.Damn right Tom Henke was an all-star back in 1987. ¬†He led the league in saves that year with 34, one of only two Jays ever to accomplish that feat. ¬†He also allowed fewer hits (5.9) and recorded more strikeouts (12.3) per nine innings than any other AL pitcher.For more about The Terminator, check out my entry about his regular card in this set. ¬†And, of course, there's The Ballad of Tom Henke.
