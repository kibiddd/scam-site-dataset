Critics Consensus
Unaccompanied Minors, while featuring credible performances by its mostly young cast, is simply a rehash of other, funnier movies.

Mixes youthful angst and hilarious hijinks in a way you'd expect from the creator of Freaks and Geeks.

...a bottom-of-the-barrel comedy that'll probably leave even small children exhausted by its nonstop energy.

I’m baffled by the lower ratings. This is a perfectly fun, sweet and goofy christmas story. The basic premise is a cat and mouse chase featuring a group of young teenagers of divorced families trying to make the most of their Christmas after their flights have been grounded, while they’re on the run from airport security. Each character has their own quirky attributes and share hilarious and wholesome moments throughout the film as they get closer as a team and as a family.
I fell in love with this film when I saw it at Girl Guides when I was 12. It had so many laugh out loud moments and I went on to show my sisters who love it too. It holds a special place in my heart and remains one of my favourite Christmas movies alongside Groundhog Day, Tokyo Godfathers and the first two Home Alone’s.

Muy buena película, una cinta increíble en mi opinión. Es una cinta interesante ya que mezcla temas como la navidad, la familia, la relacion con los padres, madurez, trabajo en equipo, entre otros. Creo que es una película que recomiendo mas que nada para ver en familia o con amigos ya que es muy divertida y sirve para pasar un buen rato. En mi opinión es una película muy entretenida de principio a fin, aunque en mi opinión me parece un poco aburrida e innecesaria la historia de los padres de Spencer y Katherine, ya que no suma nada a la trama y corta los eventos que pasan en el aeropuerto con el grupo de los niños. El humor no me parece la gran cosa, tiene alguna que otra escena que puede causar gracia pero no mucho mas. También tiene algunas conveniencias y actitudes por parte de los que controlan el aeropuerto hacia los niños que son bastante inentendibles Por otro lado, las actuaciones no están para nada mal, principalmente las de Dyllan Christopher, Quinn Shephard, Gia Mantegna, Wilmer Valderrama, Tyler James Williams y Brett Kelly. En conclusión, una buena película para ver en familia en épocas navideñas, con una historia bastante disfrutable y entretenida, junto a algún que otro personaje gracioso que suma bastante en cuanto al humor. La recomiendo.
