Save
money by finding the best
available discount rates on hotels, inns, bed and breakfasts and motels
here in the Derby, VT, area. Derby is located in Vermon't Northeast
Kingdom on the Canadian border. It's a quiet town with nice mountain
views everywhere. Newport, the commercial center of this region is only
10 minutes away. Lake Willoughby, great for summer swimming, about 40
minutes away, while Burke Mountain, a popular skiing destination in
East Burke VT, is about an hour. Down the road from Burke Mountain, we
recommend stopping at Bailey's and Burke,
for a wonderful country store experience (they have pizza, too!) and
visiting Kerrigan's Market and Deli
for
some really delicious homemade pizza and sandwiches -- try the pulled
pork with a special six-hour marinade! Dave and Judi Kerrigan -- and
family -- are truly nice people who work hard to make this unassuming,
old fashioned market so welcoming. Montreal, Quebec, surely one of
North America's greatest, most historical cities, is only two hours
away.
