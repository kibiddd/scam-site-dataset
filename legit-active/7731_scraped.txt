(Tex Beneke whistling)
GLENN MILLER: Hello there, Texas, whatcha say?
Are you whistling in the dark just to scare the ghost away?
TEX BENEKE: I know there's something following me that I can't see
Someone sure laid an awful hex on me!
GLENN MILLER: A hex? Ah, Tex, that's pretty far-fetched
Man, I'd say you're just a little bit tetched!
TEX BENEKE: You'd got a load of what I saw last night
You'd pass the Yankee Clipper on its maiden flight!
Last night I saw upon the stair
A little man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
Oh, how I wish he'd go away
When I came home last night at three
The man was waiting there for me
But when I looked around the hall
I couldn't see him there at all
Go away, go away
Don't you come back any more
Go away, go away
And please don't slam the door.....(SLAM!)
Last night I saw upon the stair
A little man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
Oh, how I wish he'd go away
