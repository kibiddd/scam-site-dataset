David Gray – Go Van Gogh                                lyrics
Please visit my website for more lyrics:
GO van GOGH!
The highs and lows of manic depression
Moments of brilliance
Coupled with the inability to tie one's own shoes
Without completely losing patience
Racing thoughts
No hunger
Can't sleep
Can't remember what day it is
Incessant need to organize
Overwhelmed by all the papers
All the books
Walking fast
talking fast
Forgetting important things
Developing many plan Bs
If you can't find it
Develop another plan
Strangely, it feels like you've broken through
A cocoon
Suddenly you remember everything
You ever wanted to do in life
Develop a sixth sense
A very accurate sixth sense
No inhibitions
Breaking through the river
Between consciousness and subconsciousness
Integrating the two spheres
Hard to comprehend
Frightening and confusing
But also breathtaking !
Somehow you can now communicate with
Your subconscious self
Manic depression
Can motivate a person to live up to their
Full potential
Can awaken a person -- internally and externally
Manic depression
Can also bring out a person's worst attributes
Overly-aggressive, dark and ugly
Van Gogh suffered immeasurably from his illness
Tried to resolve his conflicting emotions
Through his paintings
A BRILLIANT MADNESS !
Many geniuses have suffered from this illness
Evidence of their brilliance
Can be found in lyrics
Works of art
Drama
Television
Advertising
Van Gogh left his mark
But alas
He succumbed to the brilliant madness
Died at a very young age
Wrestled with his demons and lost
BUT before he went
He painted a portrait of himself
And Mona Lisa
What i suspect he was trying to say
Is that even though he didn't
Make it in his lifetime
He is hell-bent on coming back
In another vessel
In another shell
He will finish what he started
Van gogh's spirit will never die
In fact, i think he lives in our midst today
Just a matter of time before he makes himself
Known to us
(minus one ear)
Go van gogh
Go van gogh
Go van gogh
