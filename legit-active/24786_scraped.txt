The 17 North Parade imprint pays homage to the historic location of Randy’s Record Mart in Kingston, Jamaica. Entrepreneurs Vincent & Pat Chin operated a retail store and recording studio at that address from 1958 until 1979 when they relocated to New York and founded VP Records. Created in 2007, 17 North Parade is specialized in oldies reissues and compilation.
