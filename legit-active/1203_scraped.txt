Dorsey Trailer Repair
Over 20 years ago Dorsey Trailer Repair, Inc. started with a 2-bay shop and a commitment to provide customers with the best possible service and tailor that service to meet their individual needs. Working hard to establish and maintain long term partnerships with our customers provided us the momentum to grow at a healthy rate while building a solid reputation. Today we stand at the forefront in providing maintenance and repair for semi trailers and heavy-haul equipment in savannah and the surrounding area. We now operate a 14 bay facility with an in-house parts dept. and 3 full-time service trucks.
Combined with our team of experienced mechanics, who are some of the best in the business, we are able to provide an un-matched level of service. From minor repairs while under way to major repairs coming into the shop, we have the resources to get your equipment back in service and minimize downtime.
In the shop or out in the field, scheduled  maintenance, repairs or rebuilds, if you have equipment operating in Savannah or the surrounding area, Dorsey Trailer Repair is here and ready to work for you.
We are conveniently located 2.5 miles from I-95, 1.8 miles from I-16 and 4.3 miles from the Ga. ports.
