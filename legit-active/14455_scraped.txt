I loved seeing all of the memorabilia that was included :)music2 likesLike CommentJohn288 reviews23 followersFollowFollowNovember 20, 2011A great resource for Deadheads. Big on nostalgia, great anecdotes, postures, photos, tickets, writings ... Ben Fong Torres states that he is not much of a fan. You may take this to mean he is not as obsesssed as some of the Dead's legendary followers who have attended shows in the hundreds. Yet he compiles a tribute that could only be assembled by someone who loves, respects and worships this incredible band. One of those books you pickup and read straight through without stopping.1 likeLike CommentRich131 reviews11 followersFollowFollowSeptember 15, 2012I almost didn't buy this, as I didn't think there was anything new in it, but I found it at a discount, so I pulled the trigger. I was wrong! Most of the info was not new, except for a few minor nuggets, but there are photos and artifacts here I had never seen before. If you get a chance, read it!1 likeLike CommentClint173 reviewsFollowFollowJanuary 18, 2010Good short version of the Grateful Dead history. Fong-Torres is a good writer and a pleasure to read.

I got to live in the United States in 1995 in time to see the band once before the bus parked up for the last time.This book is a memento which fills in many parts of the jigsaw missing from the UK perspective.Like CommentJoshua Friedman91 reviewsFollowFollowDecember 18, 2023⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ½. A fun tactile book about my favorite band.
