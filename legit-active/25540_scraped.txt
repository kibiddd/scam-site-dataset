QUEBEC, after Montreal the most populous city in the Dominion of
Canada, capital of the province of Quebec, is situated on the left
bank of the River St. Lawrence, which here receives the St. Charles,
400 milts from the mouth of the River St. Lawrence at Point des
Monts, 180 miles N.E. of Montreal, and 328 miles N.N.W. of Portland,
Me. Lat. (of N.E. bastion) 46°
40' 6' N., lon. 71° 13' 45" W.
Mean temperature in winter l1°,
in summer 68° Fahrenheit. Mean
of the year 39.
The city has a remarkably picturesque situation between, the two
rivers at the N.E. extremity of a narrow but elevated table land,
which, for about 8 miles, forms the left bank of the St. Lawrence.
Cape Diamond, the extremity of the table land, is 333 feet above the
level of the river, to which it presents a nearly precipitous face;
the descent to the St Charles is more gradual. The distance from one
river to the other across the ridge is rather more than a mile.
Opposite Cape Diamond the St. Lawrence is contracted to a breadth of
only 1,314 yards; but immediately below, at the confluence of the
St. Charles, it spreads out into a broad and beautiful basin more
than 2,500 yards wide, forming a capacious and excellent harbor. The
spring tides rise and fall 18 feet.
Quebec is divided into two parts, called Upper and Lower Towns. The
Upper Town occupies the highest part of the promontory; it is
surrounded with walls, and otherwise fortified The ancient citadel,
which crowns the summit of Cape Diamond, covers, with its numerous
works, an area of 40 acres and from its position is probably the
strongest fortress in America.
The chief ascents to the Upper Town are by a steep and narrow
winding street and by a flight of steps.
The Lower Town, which is the seat of commerce, is built around the
base of Cape Diamond, where, in many places, the rock has been cut
away to make room for the houses On the side of the St. Charles the
water at flood tide formerly washed the very foot of the rock, but
from time to time wharf after wharf has been projected towards low
water mark, and foundations made sufficiently solid on which to
build whole streets, where boats and even vessels of considerable
burthen once rode at anchor. The banks of both rivers are now lined
with warehouses and wharves, the latter jutting about 200 feet into
the stream; and along which the water is of sufficient depth to
admit vessels of the largest size. The streets are generally
irregular and narrow, in few instances are they well paved and
lighted The houses are principally of stone and brick, 2 or 3
stories high, the older ones with steep and quaint looking roofs.
The city has several times suffered from disastrous fires, but the
result has been the erection of more attractive buildings, and a
consequent great improvement in the general appearance of the city.
During the year 1854, a plentiful supply of water was introduced
from Lake St. Charles.
In the Upper Town are several squares and public walks commanding
views unrivalled for their varied and picturesque beauty. In one
stands a substantial monument, erected to the joint memory of
Generals Wolfe and Montcalm, the English and French commander.who
fell at the taking of Quebec in 1759. It consists of an obelisk
resting on a granite pedestal, the whole 65 feet high. A monument 40
feet in height marks the spot where General Wolfe fell on the Plains
of Abraham; while on the St. Foy road stands an iron pillar
surmounted by a bronze statue, presented by Prince Napoleon
Bonaparte in 1855, intended to commemorate a fierce struggle which
look place here in 1700 between the British and French troops.
Among the public buildings of Quebec may be mentioned the Parliament
Buildings, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, an irregular budding,
capable of containing 4,000 persons, and covering, with the
university attached, an area of 8 acres; the English Cathedral,
surmounted by a lofty spire; and St. Johns Free Scotch Church, also
adorned with a spire, occupying elevated positions in the Upper
Town.
There are in all 19 churches in Quebec, and 1 Synagogue. Of the
churches 7 are Roman Catholic; 7 Church of England; 1 Church of
Scotland; 1 Presbyterian; 1 Baptist; 1 Congregational, and 1
Wesleyan Methodist.
The educational institutions comprise 3 Roman Catholic Colleges,
viz: Laval University, with faculties of law, medicine and arts; the
Grand S minary, and the Minor Seminary; the Ursuline convent, an
extensive establishment founded in 1641; several nunneries; Morrin
College, with 10 professors; Laval Normal and Model School; the
Quebec High School; and a number of academies and private and public
schools There are in addition the Canadian and Mechanics Institute,
provided with libraries and reading rooms; the Literary and
Historical Society, the oldest chartered institution of the kind in
Canada, having been founded in 1824, and possessing valuable
"Records of the Realm," in 80 or 90 fohos, and a large collection of
Historical manuscripts, but nearly the whole of its museum, and a
great part of its library, were destroyed by fire with the
Parliament buildings in 1854; the Entomological Society, St.
Patrick's Literary Institute, Advocates Library, Board of Trade, and
Merchant's Exchange.
Six daily a newspapers are published in Quebec, 3 of which are in
the French language.
The principal benevolent institutions are the Marine Hospital, the
Hotel Dieu, the General Hospital, and the Lunatic Asylum at
Beauport.
Quebec has the head offices of 3 bank, viz; Quebec Bank, Banque
Nationale, and Union Bank of Lower Canada, besides which there are 2
savings banks, and agencies of the Bank of Montreal and Bank of
British North America
Shipbuilding is the chief manufacturing industry of Quebec. There
are also manufactories of iron castings, machinery, cutlery, nails,
leather, musical instruments, boots and shoes, paper, India rubber
goods, rope, tobacco, steel, etc.
Quebec is an important port of Canada, and the most ancient. The
great staple of export is timber, Montreal being the port where the
agricultural exports are chiefly exchanged for supplies of foreign
goods. The timber is furnished principally by the Ottawa and St
Maurice rivers As the rafts come down the river, they are collected
into what are called Cones and secured by booms moored along the
banks, the timber being partly afloat, partly aground, according to
the rise or fall of the tides These coves extend almost continuously
along the left bank of the St. Lawrence, for a distance of six miles
above the town, throughout the whole of which, at certain seasons,
may be seen a mass of logs with a breadth varying from 150 to 200
yards. There are also extensive timber and deal sawing
establishments near the city, on the right bank of the St. Lawrence.
The number of arrivals at Quebec from sea in 1872 was 1,002 (tons
783,316), and the clearances 989 (tons 767,784). Total value of
imports $7,532,221; exports $11,931,077. New ships built at Quebec
in 1872, 13 (tons 7,911); value $332,262.
Quebec returns three members to the House of Commons, and three to
the Provincial Legislature. It is the seat of the See of two
Bishops, the Lord Bishop of Quebec (Church of England), and the
Archbishop of Quebec (Church of Rome). Pop. in 1832, 27,562; in
1844, 34,500; in 1852, 42,052; in 1861,51,100; and in 1871, 59,699,
52,337 of whom were Roman Catholics, chiefly French Canadians.
Quebec was first visited by Jacques Cartier in 1535. It then
consisted of an Indian village called Stadacona. In July, 1608,
Champlain founded the city giving it its present name. The progress
of its aggrandizement was slow, in consequence of the hostilities of
the powerful Iroquois. In 1629 it fell into the hands of the
English; but, with the whole of Canada, was restored to the French
in 1632. From this, period some attention was paid to the increase
of the city; and in 1663, when the colony was made a royal
government, it became the capital. In 1690 the English attempted to
reconquer it, but met with a disastrous defeat; but in 1759 it was
captured by the brave General Wolfe, and has since been under the
British Crown. An unsuccessful attempt was made by the Americans to
carry the city by assault on the night of December 31, 1775, when
General Montgomery was slain.
QUEBEC, a county in the S.W. part of Quebec, comprises an area of
1,602,-699 acres. This county is drained by the Bostonnais,
Batiscan, St. Charles, Montmorency and other streams. It has the St,
Lawrence for its S.E. boundary. Capital, Cnarlesbourg. Pop. 19,607
QUEBEC, a province of the Dominion of Canada, bounded on the N. by
Labrador and Hudson's Bay; on the E. by Labrador and the Gulf of St.
Lawrence; on the S by Baie des Chaleurs, New Brunswick and the State
of Maine; on the S.E by the States of New Hampshire, Vermont and New
York; and on the S.W by the River Ottawa and the Province of
Ontario. Length from Lake Temiscaminque to Anse au Blanc Sablon, in
the Straits of Belle Isle, about 1,000 miles due east and west
course, and from the above named lake to Cape Gaspe, about 700
miles; breadth about 300 miles The total territorial superficies
comprises, land and inland waters, 123,747,140 acres, or 193.355
square statute miles, or 500,679 square kilometers. The surface of
the country is varied and grand, consisting of boundless forests,
magnificent rivers and lakes, extensive prairies, bold, rocky
heights and foaming cataracts, diversified by cultivated fields,
pretty villages and settlements, some stretching up along mountains,
fertile islands, rich pastures, and well fed flocks.
The principal mountain ranges stretch from S.W. to N.E. and lie
nearly parallel to each other. They consist of the Notre Dame or
Green Mountains, so called from the fine forests that cover their
slopes, which, from the latitude of the city of Quebec, follow
nearly the whole course of the St. Lawrence, on the S side of which
they are situated, and terminate on the Gulf of the same name,
between Baie des Chaleurs and Gaspe Point On the N. side of the
river is the Laurentian range, which forms undulating ridges of
about 1,000 feet in elevation , the Mealy mountains stretching from
about lat 75° W. to Sandwich
Bay, computed to be about 1,500 feet high, and always covered with
snow; and the Wotchish mountains, a short range, of crescent form
between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Hudson's Bay. The rocky masses
connected with the mountain chains that line the St. Lawrence
advance in many places close to the stream, forming precipitous
cliffs, frequently 200 and 300 feet high. The banks of the St.
Lawrence are in many places composed of schist, in a decaying or
moldering condition and in every quarter granite is found, more or
less inclined, but never parallel to the horizon In the Gaspe
district numerous and beautiful specimens of quartz have been
obtained; indications of coal have also been traced. The limestone
format ion extends over 30,000 square miles; the dip is moderate aid
the strata of limestone generally undisturbed. Along the shores of
the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence horizontal banks of shells
appear at various heights from 10 to 100 feet above high water mark,
and inland beaches of sand and shingle, with similar shells: as also
elevated limestone rocks, scooped out by the waves, and showing
lines of lithodomous perforations  all indicating the successive
up-heaving of the land since the sea was inhabited by the existing
species of testacea. Earthquakes have been very frequent in the
province, and some of them of considerable violence.
The province of Quebec is richly endowed with mines of gold, copper,
iron and other ores. Gold is found chiefly on the banks of the
Chaudiere. Copper is found in large quantities in the Eastern
townships. Iron is found almost everywhere, and is of superior
quality. Lead, silver, zinc, platinum, &c, also occur in various
sections.
The great River St. Lawrence flows through the Province. Just above
Montreal it receives from the N. W. the Ottawa, a river 800 miles
long, and in no degree inferior to it in interest. Below Montreal it
receives, on the right, the Richelieu river, Laving its source in
Lake Champlain; the St. Francis, rising in Lake Memphremagog; and
the Chaudiere, the outlet of Lake Megantic; and, on the left, the
St. Maurice, the Batiscan and the Saguenay rivers, from 200 to 400
miles in length. The latter is the outlet of the large and beautiful
Lake St. John.
The climate of Quebec, though similar to that of Ontario, is colder
in winter and warmer in summer. Spring bursts forth in great beauty,
and vegetation is rapid. In winter the cold is generally steady; and
the atmosphere is clear and bracing, which renders the sleighing
very agreeable and pleasant. Winter generally commences the latter
end of November and lasts until the end of March. During the winter
months the trees are oftentimes covered with frost. Nothing can be
imagined more beautiful and brilliant than the effect of sunshine on
a calm day on the frozen boughs, where every particle of the icy
crystals sparkles, and nature seems decked in diamonds. The soil is
generally rich and adapted to the growth of cereals, hay and green
crops Apples and plums grow in abundance The greater portion of the
province is covered by forests consisting chiefly of white and red
pine. Numerous quantities of this timber are annually sent to
England The other kinds of timber are ash, birch, beech, elm,
hickory, black walnut, maple, cherry, butternut, basswood, spruce,
fir, &c- On the 30th of June, 1872, there were 5,894,018 acres of
Crown Lands surveyed and ready to be disposed of, and over
100,000,000 acres yet unsurveyed. The revenue from timber dues,
ground rents, &c., from July 1st, 1867, to June 30th, 1872, amounted
to $1,740,968.35.
The lumber regions of Canada must, under judicious management, long
remain a fruitful source of revenue to the provinces of Quebec and
Ontario. The augmenting and progressive demand in Great Britain and
the United States, the West Indies, and South America, for rough and
manufactured timber has given an enormous value within the last
decade to timber limits; and, as a natural result, explorations have
been pushed far into the interior, and regions long neglected, have
acquired a commercial value. If we examine the records of the Crown
Lands Department for the province of Quebec we find evidence to show
that large areas have been acquired at prices far beyond the rates
of former days. Thus in 1867, when the British North American
provinces were confederated, and each province invested with the
control of the forest lands within its limits, rough surveys had
been made of 192,000 square miles, though only a small portion had
been leased, as the following tables will explain:
Number of square miles under license iti 1868
25,000
Number of square miles vacant
167,000
Total income in 1868
$195,115
Number of square miles under license in 1872
42,399
Number of square miles vacant
149,601
Total income in 1872
$444,752
Thus 25,000 miles in 1568 yielded a revenue of
$195,115
While 42,399 miles in 1872 yielded a revenue of
$444,752
For many years past skilled explorers and surveyors have been employed in the
interior, making themselves thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the soil,
and the quantity and character of the forests.
Messrs. Russell, Symes and Casgrain were employed ascertaining the value of the
forest lands on the Upper Ottawa above Quinze River, between Lakes Victoria and
Expanse, included in latitudes 47° and 48°
and longitudes 76° to 79° They were
engaged on this duty at intervals during the years 1806 to 1871; and Messrs. W.
Wagner, Lindsay Russell, Duncan Sinclair and Lahore, between the years 1805 and
1870 made exhaustive explorations of the country around the head waters of the
Gatineau, Lievre and Rouge, but more especially within latitudes 46°
and 47° and longitudes 74°
and 75°. The great impediment in the path of
the lumber merchant who acquires distant timber limits is, the enormous cost of
clearing out the smaller streams from their incumbrances so that lugs can be
floated; and also constructing slides to overcome heavy rapids and falls.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars must often be 1aid out in preliminary works of
this character before a single saw log or piece of square timber can be brought
to market. These reasons will explain partly why such large areas of forest
land, do not enjoy a high commercial value, and why the following limits yet
await purchasers:
MILES
St. Maurice territory, limits yet vacant
6,000
Gatineau, limits yet vacant
1,000
Upper Ottawa, limits yet vacant
3,000
Other sections of the province, including Labrador and Gaspé
139,000
Total miles awaiting purchasers
149,000
Being equivalent to 107,000,000 acres of unsurveyed lands.
The timber limits of Gaspe only acquired a commercial value within the last few
years, but now they are attracting attention, and beginning to bring in a
revenue. Timber limits vary in size according to the standing of the lessees,
many of the large lumbering establishments holding hundreds of square miles. The
Governments of Ontario and Quebec never relinquish their proprietary rights;
they invariably retain the fond or proprietary right; merely leasing the
usufruct. Formerly the leases were of short duration and at very moderate rates,
bit experience taught the Crown Land Departments that, under long leases, the
limit holders would have a direct pecuniary interest in protecting the forests
from disastrous fires, and judiciously selecting their annual cuttings, so as to
permit the growth of the young timber.
Under the existing system of granting licenses, the leases continue in force for
twenty-one years, with the right of renewal at such bonus as the Commissioners
may stipulate when the lease expires. Thirty years since, two dollars per square
mile was regarded as a high rate to pay per square mile for a timber limit, but
the rates have advanced so rapidly, consequent oil the United States demand for
lumber, that thirty and thirty-five dollars were freely paid in 1872 per square
mile, for twelve hundred miles. The thirty dollars is a prime or bonus for a
twenty-one years' lease, but there are annual charges attaching to each mile of
limit worked, called ground rent and stumpage, amounting to some four dollars
per square mile per annum.
In 1872, Quebec had 793 miles of railway in operation; 305 miles in course of
construction; and 252 miles for which charters had been granted. The railways in
operation were, the Grand Trunk and brandies, the Montreal and Vermont Junction,
Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly, South Eastern, Montreal, Chambly and Sorel,
Intercolonial, Massawippi Valley, Gosford (wooden), and St. Lawrence and
Industry; those in course of construction were the Intercolonial (to be
completed in 1874), Levis and Kennebec, St. Francis and Lake Megantic, Northern
Colonization; and those chartered were the North Shore, Montreal and St. Lin,
and Richmond, Melbourne and Missisquoi.
The province, as regards civil matters, is divided into parishes, townships,
counties and districts. Whenever a new district is sufficiently populous to form
a parish, the Roman Catholic Diocesan Bishop, upon the requisition of a majority
of the inhabitants, orders its canonical erection into a parish. By a proceeding
somewhat analogous the civil authorities order the civil erection of municipal
corporations. The town-ships arc of English origin. After the ce o i of Canada
to Great Britain, the English land system of holding in free and common soccage
was Instituted for the feudal system upon all Crown Lands, and then the township
took the place of the seigniory. The regular limits of a township are ten miles
square, or 100 superficial miles. Such townships as are not subdivided into
parishes preserve for all municipal or other purposes their legal limits. The
counties were established for the purposes of representation, each county having
the right to send one member to the House of Commons every five years, and one
to the Local Legislature every four years. In addition to this each county forms
a registration division for registration of mortgages, &c. The parish and
township municipalities comprised in a county form what is called a county
municipality. The province is divided into 65 electoral districts, viz:

For judicial purposes the province is divided into 20 districts, each judicial
district having ample and equal jurisdiction in all matters, except as to
revision and appeal. The Superior Court sits in revision only at Montreal and
Quebec , the Court of Appeal also sits only at .Montreal and Quebec.
Public instruction is under the control and direction of the Provincial
Secretary, who is also called the Minister of Public Instruction, and who is
assisted by a Council of 21 members, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, 14 of
whom are Roman Catholics and 7 Protestants. Primary education is so far
compulsory that every citizen is bound to con-tribute a moderate tax assessed on
bis property. In municipalities where there are different religious
denominations the school commissioners of the majority govern. The schools of
the minority are called dissentient schools, whose trustees are invested with
the same authority as the commissioners of schools of the majority. In the
cities of Montreal and Quebec there are separate boards of commissioners for the
Protestant and Roman Catholic schools. Teachers are trained in Nor-mal schools,
supported at the expense of the Province. In 1871 there were in the province
3,039 elementary schools, 227 model schools, 147 agricultural, commercial a id
special schools, and 15 classical colleges and seminaries The Protestant
Universities are McGill College, at Montreal, founded in 1827, and Bishop's
College, Lennoxville, founded in 1843. The Roman Catholic University of Laval
was founded by the Quebec Seminary in 1852.
The prevailing religion is that of the Church of Rome. The Roman Catholic
Dioceses are six in number, viz: the Archdiocese of Quebec ,and the Dioceses of
Montreal, Three Rivers, St. Hyacinthe, Sherbrooke and Rimouski. The Protestant
Dioceses are two in number: Montreal, the Metro political See, and Quebec.
According to the census of 1871, the religious denominations in the province
were as follows:
Church of England
62,449
Church of Rome
1,019.850

There are four cities in the province: Montreal, population 107,225; Quebec,
59,669; Three Rivers 7,570; and St. Hyacinthe, 3,746. The principal manufactures
are cloth, linen, furniture, leather, sawn lumber, flax, hardware, paper,
chemicals, soap, boots and shoes, cotton and woolen goods, steam engines and
locomotives, wooden ware of all descriptions, agricultural implements, ships,
&c. The facilities for manufacturing afforded by abundant water power are
excellent.
The public affairs of the province are administered by a Lieutenant Governor, an
Executive Council of 7 members, a Legislative Council of 24 members, appointed
for life, and a Legislative Assembly of 65 members. The judicial department
comprises a Court of Queen's Bench, with a Chief Justice and 4 assistants: a
Superior Court, with Chief Justice and 26 assistants; a Court of vice Admiralty;
Courts of Quarter Sessions; and Courts for the summary trial of small causes.
According to late returns the total value of the imports from all foreign
countries in 1872 amounted to $49,370,176, of which $8,971,658 were from the
United States, and $33,731,014 from Great Britain. The exports for the same
period amounted to $11,823,470. The imports for Montreal alone amounted to
$40,088,005, and exports $18,171,384. The chief articles exported were pot and
pearl ashes, flour, wheat, oats, barley, butter, cheese, copper, wool, and
lumber. In 1872 there arrived at the several ports of the province 1,608 vessels
with an aggregate burthen of 1,334,086 tons. During the same period there
cleared 1,660 vessels; tons 1,135,715.
The commerce of the province is greatly facilitated by several canals which
avoid the most violent rapids of the St. Lawrence. These are the Lachine canal,
extending from Montreal to Lake St. Louis; the Beauharnois canal, uniting Lakes
St. Francis and St. Louis; the Chambly canal, uniting Lake Champlain with the
Richelieu river; and the Carillon and Grenville canal.
The province contains many grand and beautiful objects of interest to the
tourist. The Ottawa and its tributaries abound in falls and rapids of an
exceedingly picturesque character. Ascending this stream a little above Rigaud
you have Carillon Falls, a series of rapids 12 miles in length. Near Ottawa city
a branch, called the Rideau, pours its waters down a perpendicular bed of blue
limestone, 50 feet, into the Ottawa. The Chaudiere Falls, (the Indian name of
which is Kanajo, "the Boiling Pot') in the same vicinity, are wild and grand.
The Fall in no place exceeds 40 feet, but the rapids extend 6 miles, and the
water foams, tosses, and tumbles among rocks of every shape, in perpetual
variety, and in such a manner as never to weary the eye, appearing like a
multitude of different streams " struggling for a passage." An excellent view of
the whole is had from a line suspension bridge over the Ottawa. One portion of
the river is separated from the main stream, and falls into a subterranean
passage. When this part of Canada was an unbroken wilderness, an enterprising
American named Philemon Wright established himself at the falls, selecting the
mouth or Hull side as his residence. His descendants include the present
Common's Members for the counties of Pontiac and Ottawa. The late Philemon
Wright had his attention early attracted to the strange phenomenon of a
considerable portion of the Chaudiere Falls descending into a rocky basin
without any apparent outlet. Having built the first saw mill ever erected on the
Ottawa river, at that part of the falls immediately above the lost channel, and
being curious to know its outlet, he followed the course of the river downwards
for sixty miles, examining the shore line on each side, but he was unable to
discover the slightest trace of the saw dust or saw mill debris daily cast into
the lost channel, and to this day the enigma has baffled curiosity and science,
and the outlet is a mystery. At these and the other falls are timber slides
constructed at great expense. Les Chats, another series of falls or rapids, 30
miles farther up, are formed by the river breaking, at high water, over the
rocks in 33 distinct shoots, spreading across the river to a width of 4 miles.
Some of these separate shoots would, in many places, be called large rivers and
are very remarkable falls, and well worthy the attention of the tourist. At
Calumet there is another rapid of scarcely less interest; a fall of 120 feet in
the Keepawa branch; besides, a number of inferior falls and rapids, studded with
saw mills, and the banks in many places wild and rugged; while the river often
expands into beautiful lakes. The well known Falls of Montmorency, 7 miles below
Quebec, with a perpendicular descent of 240 feet; the Falls of the Chaudiere, on
the S. side of the St. Lawrence, 10 miles above Quebec, with a perpendicular
pitch of 125 feet down a deep chasm; the beautiful Falls of the St. Anne, on the
N. shore of the St. Lawrence, 22 miles below Quebec; and the Long Sault, Cedars
and Lachine rapids are all on the fashionable route of tourists. But the
grandest river scenery is to be seen on the Saguenay river, which enters the St.
Lawrence about 120 miles below Quebec. The last 60 miles of its course are
exceedingly sublime. The banks, varying in height from 500 to 1,500 feet, not
only often perpendicular, but absolutely overhanging the dark, deep river below
"as if to gaze at its own rugged features." The precipitancy continues below as
well as above the water, which has been found as deep within 5 feet of the shore
as in the middle; and near its mouth a line of 3,000 feet failed to reach the
bottom. The depth in other parts varies from 100 to 1,000 feet. The upper part
of the Saguenay abounds in falls and rapids. Excursions are made from Montreal
and Quebec to this river in steamboats. The scenery on the N. bank of the St.
Lawrence alone is worth the trip.
The Indian population of the province of Quebec in 1871 was 8,657  Nepissing,
Algonquins, Abenakis, Hurons, Amalicites, Micmacs, Montagnais and Nasquapees.
The province is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1407; but the
first settlement made by Europeans was in 1541, near Quebec, by Jacques Cartier,
a French navigator, who sailed up the St. Lawrence, to which he gave its present
name. In 1G08, a permanent settlement was made by the French upon the present
site of the city of Quebec. From this period till 1759 the French continued to
occupy the country, though much harassed by various tribes of Indians,
particularly the Iroquois; but in the year hut named an English army, under
General Wolfe, captured Quebec; and by September 8, 1730, all other places
within the government of Cana-da were surrendered to the British, and the French
power entirely annihilated. In 1792 the province was divided into Upper and
Lower Canada, but in 1840, after serious political dissensions, they were
reunited under the name of the United Provinces of Canada. In 1867, they were
again separated, and under the names respectively of Ontario and Quebec, form
the two most important provinces in the Dominion of Canada.
QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLANDS, a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, off the
coast of British Columbia, N. of Vancouver Island, between lat. 52° and 54 N,
and lon. 131° and 133°
W. These islands form part of British Columbia. They were first discovered by
the celebrated navigator Capt. Cook, in 1778, and taken possession of by Dixon
in 1787 in the name of the British Crown. The group consists of 2 large islands
and 2 smaller ones, lying in an archipelago of islets. The 4 principal ones,
called Graham, Moresby, North and Prescott, are divided merely by narrow arm3 of
the sea, and taken together measure 180 miles in length by 60 miles at greatest
breadth. This group is described as the Eden of the North Pacific. The climate
is so delicious, caused in some degree by the Heated river, or the Pacific Gulf
stream, that skirts the coast of Japan and with a speed of 80 miles every 24
hours runs N. and washes the coast of British Columbia. The Queen Charlotte
Islands teem with various mineral products. Gold bearing quartz of very rich
quality was extracted at a point called Mitchell's Harbor, as far back as 1852.
Copper and iron ores exist; and a fine vein of Anthracite coal, of a superior
quality, has been partially wrought, but the working is at present suspended for
want of capital. These islands are hilly, though not mountainous; the interior
is clothed with magnificent forests of the finest timber; the coasts are
indented with inviting harbors.
QUEENS, a county occupying the middle part of Prince Edward Island. Area 493,700
acres. Capital, Charlottetown.

through the county to Fredericton, 90 miles from its mouth. Steamboats also
navigate Grand Lake and Salmon river. Capital, Gagetown. Pop. 13,847.
QUEENS, a county in the S.W. part of Nova Scotia, bounded on the S by the
