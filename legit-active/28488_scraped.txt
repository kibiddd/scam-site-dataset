The 15 minute MYKwebTV/TotalCFL TV show from 2001 Grey Cup won me a A-Channel Calgary competition. Above is Pt 1. Candice's lucky bra is Wow! To watch  Full screen, add comments, Click here
This CFL Canadian Football League season is the 100th. In November the   100th CFL Grey Cup Festival will be held in Toronto. The Grey Cup is the   Championship game of the CFL and a fantastic five day event.
I have attended eleven Grey Cup Festivals, each year it is one of my   very favourite weeks. It all started for me in 1998 when I went to a   CFL BC Lions vs Calgary Stampeders game at BC Place in Vancouver. I call   it “Pammy’s BC Place” as that is where Pamela Anderson was first   discovered.  I really enjoyed the game and the great fans. In 1999 I   again attended BC Lions games in Vancouver with the highlights being the   Halloween game BC Lions vs Hamilton Tiger-Cats, my first playoff game   and then the 1999 Grey Cup which was in Vancouver. I had an excellent   CFL Canadian Football League Grey Cup media pass.
What an incredible time my first Grey Cup Festival was. Attending   media events and the amazing parties throughout the afternoons and   evenings was fantastic. On the Sunday night after the game at The Shark   Club a popular Sports bar, a Hamilton Tiger-Cats fan grabbed me and just   laughed saying “Aussie mate, you are amazing! I’ve seen you everywhere   the past 4 days and nights! Great effort!” That sums up my time for   sure, not much sleep was had. I have an amazing 20 minutes of edited   footage from the 1999 Grey Cup as part of the movie/documentary I have   produced. Several mates from this 1999 Grey Cup Festival really enjoyed a   2 hour video that I produced within weeks of the event.
The 2000 CFL Canadian Football League Grey Cup. A week before the   2000 CFL Playoffs I moved from Vancouver to live in Calgary. This was   great timing as I got to see the BC Lions upset the fancied Calgary   Stampeders in the Western Final in Calgary.  It was funny to me as I’m   driving around Calgary listening to the radio and the “many” sports   media people and FM radio hosts saying how they were going to win the   Grey Cup especially seeing it was being held in Calgary. I thought to   myself, well hang on you have to defeat the BC Lions first.  In the   Western Final Stampeders quarterback Dave Dickenson was injured and the   BC Lions went on to cause an upset. As I’m settling into my new home I   was ecstatic as I my favourite team the BC Lions was about to play in   the 2000 Grey Cup against the Montreal Alouettes. The BC Lions went on   to defeat the favoured Montreal Alouettes. I had a Grey Cup media pass   for the day but at this point in time I was starting to realise it was   so much fun being a fan and filming the great fans and action at the   parties I didn’t need to attend the official media events.
In 2001 I enjoyed a great CFL Canadian Football League season   attending all the Stampeders games. The tailgate party was amazing, at   the time the biggest and best in Canada. I became mates with “Oldpaint”   Grant Painter the guy that is recognised as starting this massive   tailgate party several years earlier. Oldaint camped out for many days   and nights in very cold weather up very high in a scaffold tower until   the Stamps sold a certain number of season tickets. Right next to   Oldpaint’s truck in the tailgate party was many of the original members   of the original biggest CFL fan website http://www.Total-CFL.com Many   great times were had at the Stamps games in 2001.
I headed to Montreal for the 2001 CFL Canadian Football League Grey   Cup and amazingly the Calgary Stampeders made it through to the Grey Cup   after having an average regular season. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were   hot favourites to win the Grey Cup but the Stampeders shocked the   massive crowd at Montreal Olympic Stadium to win the Grey cup.
The 2001 Montreal Grey Cup was again a great time at the parties.   Again I had a great CFL Grey Cup media pass and was on the sidelines for   the last five minutes, right on the field when the game was over and   then in the Stampeders locker rooms filming and interviewing Stamps   players. The 15 minute MYKwebTV/TotalCFL TV show that I produced won me   an A-Channel TV Calgary competition. Three great CFL Canadian Football   League Grey Cup Festivals. In this the 100th CFL year I will continue to   write about more great times at the CFL Grey Cups." Myk Aussie

My
CFL Grey Cup 05 report. The Edmonton Eskimos defeated the Montreal Alouettes
in Overtime 38-35 in a great game. In front of a sellout crowd minus a few it
was a great day and an amazing week here in Vancouver. At my 6th CFL Grey Cup
week it was great to again meet up with the legend CFLers. I have many great
stories, many great new friends and some fantastic interviews from the week
including a 8 minute 1 on 1 interview with Eskimos Wide Receiver Ed Hervey, 5
minutes 1 on 1 with BC Lions Champ Jason Clermont and a fantastic conversation I
had with the real Pamela Anderson as she drove past me and Cwoc Pammy in her
Aussie hat in the contestant and media section of the awesome and luckily sunny
Grey Cup Parade. Great footage as I finally meet the real Pammy. It was great to
see her and her friends laugh at my comedy.
Other amazing Total-CFLwebTV that I have coming this week and over the coming
weeks includes footage and interviews with the very funny Trailer Park Boys
Bubbles who was The Green Man, the legend Tiger Cat fans the Box J Boys,
Argos and former Lion Champ Running Back Sean Millington, recent CFL Hall of
Famer Willie Pless at the Spirit Of Edmonton, US star Super Dave Osborne, 1 on 1
with one of the refs of the game on the Saturday night at the Spirit Of
Edmonton, Fritos Bombers Plungerhead. Also footage from the 8th Annual Snow
Bowl played on Saturday and organized by Lionbackers BC49. I had a run as a WR
for the West. The East won 12-0 over the West. Includes a 1 on 1 interview with
Total-CFLer Eskinator explaining the history of the game and a post game
interview with the MVP of the game and also Total-CFLer BBBob. Amazing Grey Cup
Parade footage as I walk the route with Cwoc Pammy and the famous BC Booze
Brothers and interview Total-CFLer legend ScottyDog along the way. CFL
cheerleader interviews and dancing footage from the BC Lions function, Cwoc
Pammy enjoying the music and dancing to Aussie Music at the Bombers Touchdown
Manitoba show on Friday and much, much, much, more.
I should have a great 2 hours of Total-CFLwebTV/MYKwebTV from many of the
week events. Congratulations to the 2005Grey Cup committee lead by Scott Ackles
for a amazing Grey Cup week of events. Opinion has it from many Total-CFLers is
that BC certainly did a better job than in 99, the last time the Big game was
played in Vancouver. Im sure the Total-CFL Discussion board will be fired up
this week as many of the guys return home and chat about the many +ves and
naturally a few ves from the week.
Several, not many at all -ve's from the week as there were not too
many at all. The beautiful
Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas is now not as beautiful! It was a great 1/2 time
show as they performed four of their hit songs and all the CFL cheerleaders
dancd right next to them on the centre of BC Pllace. Fergie Hmmm, I believe
there has definitely been some titty enlargement which I think is a very good
thing but not sure that I like what is opinion has it her new swollen surgically
modified lips. Fergie was again very sexy performing on stage but there was definitely
a few pounds added and this showed up in her face. What was with the hair as
well? Hmmm. Luv ya Fergie but you definitely looked better at the Super Bowl
Press conference where I also made you laugh. Check it out Click here
What is with the smoke as part of the pre game and 1/2 time celebrations in a
dome? I really struggle with this as no one is allowed to smoke cigarettes in BC
Place which I agree with but then we are forced to breath in smoke as it hung
around Level 4 especially in the 2nd half. Can someone please help me on why
this happened, why they needed smoke in the celebrations as I'm going to be
going off about that on SportsRage with Gabriel Morency, probably on tonight's
show.
Injury timeouts were terrible! Now I realize if a player has a back or neck
injury the trainers have to be very careful and injury time out is needed and
wisely used but yesterday I found it very annoying on several times especially
with the Eskimos defensive player Marsh. The game was stopped for several
minutes on mote than one occasion for a knee or other not serious leg injury and
then the player walked off reasonably OK. I definitely think the teams take
advantage of this injury timeout but it was very annoying. Players should be
taken off the field ASAP. The nice young lady that I meet at the game sitting
next to me was very annoyed at this.
I also believe Cwoc Pamela Anderson would not have liked the KFC logo and commercial on the Big
screen. Pamela was great in the Parade and she also appeared during the game with
her two boys that were dressed in 05 Grey Cup jerseys.
The BC Lions show on the Friday night I had a great time but it was somewhat
disappointing as I believe Jason Clermont was the only player there. I have a
great interview coming with Jason this week to Total-CFLwebTV/MYKwebTV.
I also know that CFL committee chairman Dennis Skulsky was not happy when he
went  to the media centre and his Media pass was not ready. I didn't apply
this year for media as I simply didn't want one or really need one. I wore my
Super Bowl 05 pass around so hopefully the CFL are OK with me showing the great
player interviews I have and great footage from the events although my $145 Grey
Cup ticket says otherwise. I know some of the top BC Lions guys and many many
other CFL officials and especially the players like the way I promote the game
via Total-CFLwebTV/MYKwebTV to the World. I'm adding lots of footage over the
next weeks.
It
was a truly magnificent week in my home city of 5 years, Vancouver.

My
1 on 1 interview with Ed Hervey!
I got a great 8 min 1
on 1 interview with Ed Hervey last night at The Spirit Of Edmonton. Ed gave me as much time as I wanted. Like or
dislike him he is excellent to interview & was again friendly to me & as
we see on TSN, Rogers etc he likes to Talk the Talk but he often then backs up
his talk on the field.
I have to disagree with Ed on 2 points though.
1) He takes Dave over Casey.
2) I asked him was there a rift between he & Jason as he did say earlier in
the week on TV that he wanted Jason Clermont's locker.
He says Jason Clermont does not perform in Big games. I was very surprised at
that comment. I'm taking Pammy out again today to the Winterpeg Touchdown show
& then to the Lions show.
Me with Cwoc Pammy on CTV and CBC National News! I took Cwoc Pammy out
yesterday to the opening of the Grey Cup. CTV and CBC loved it and they showed
us on Sports News. I knew she would be a hit this weekend seeing the real Pamela
is here later today. Now I got to try and interview the real Pamela. That would
be good for my TV show.
Pammy
Lee Anderson Harrison was also recently
sighted out and about in Vancouver
in during the Halloween 05 weekend in
readiness for her upcoming Grey Cup 05
appearances. Pammy was again not only
very popular with the guys but also the
ladies. Wow! For Pammy

CFLers Welcome to Vancouver!
As you guys know I don't come on here much but I read and learn lots on here. I
just wanted to say welcome to everyone that is coming to Vancouver as Grey Cup
started today, Al's have arrived. I
hope everyone enjoys the city which has been my home for 5 out of the 7 1/2
years that I have been in Canada. It's been foggy all day, no rain would be a
huge bonus especially for the Parade. If it's sunny we are very lucky.
I
was at the airport Tuesday when the Alouettes arrived, got a good interview with
Anwar Stewart. Scott Ackles Grey Cup boss was there, a band was playing
especially for the Al's arrival. Had a chat to Dave Jamieson who is the Eskimos
Media boss. He arrived just before the Al's and said the Eskimos were flying in
at 6pm.
As
normal I'll be filming over Grey Cup. If any of you guys like the camera I'll be
happy to do a Total-CFLwebTV/MYKwebTV interview with you. Anyone can call me at
anytime if they want 1 403 870-5578 cell especially if something good is
happening that I should be filming. See
some of you Thursday night at Spirit Of Edmonton.
"Yoooooooooooooooo Myk,
