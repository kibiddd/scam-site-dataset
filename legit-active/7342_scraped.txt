The Zillah center point is around 3 miles northeast of American Hops Museum and 3 miles northeast of Toppenish Museum.
"With its beautiful scenery and amazing wines, it's no wonder that Zillah is known as the wine lover's heaven."
By Stephanie Higgins, Travel Writer
Zillah is a city in Yakima County, the state of Washington, with a population of around 3,000. It is located in the center of Washington's wine country and there is a wide range of wineries. Plus, you can visit Zillah Lakes there, a group of three man-made reservoirs that offer fishing, swimming, and boating. They are stocked with rainbow trout, and there are bass, catfish, and bluegill, too. Zillah was founded in 1891 and named for one of its early settlers, Miss Zillah Oakes. The place was incorporated as a town in 1911. It is located in the Yakima Valley, a region of Washington that is known for its agriculture. The valley is home to more than 300 wineries, and Zillah is at the center of this wine industry. In addition, there are several parks and recreation facilities in the area, including Kreiger Park and the City of Zillah Ice House Park. If you are searching for a place to stay in the town, there are many hotels and motels to choose from. There are several bed and breakfast establishments in the area, too. Zillah is a great location to visit for wine lovers, outdoor enthusiasts, and history buffs. There is something for everyone here. More from this guide...
