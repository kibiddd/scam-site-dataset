Burt Bacharach’s Musical Director: “I’d Never Seen That Kind of Intensity”
Posted on February 12, 2023  by  mark
Burt’s former musical director Rob Shirakbari spoke with Tidal about his experience working with Bacharach.
Burt Bacharach’s Musical Director: “I’d Never Seen That Kind of Intensity”Rob (Shrock) Shirakbari had a front-row seat to Bacharach’s magic. Actually, he was so physically close to the songwriter onstage that, as he recalls, “we could high-five each other.” Bacharach’s musical director for roughly a decade and a half, and Warwick’s from 2011 until 2022, Shirakbari remembers a larger-than-life figure of “real command and presence,” of swagger and panache.
