What's The Purpose Of This???

In all my years I have never seen a half page Arbitron questionnaire. Name, address, city, state, age, favorite TV station, favorite radio station, favorite types of programming and how much you watch/listen.  No in-depth diary. No leg monitor. Just what I mentioned above.
My question is: what will they get out of that small of an amount of information?

An attempt to increase response rate.  If you will answer that questionaire and send it back, you're much more likely to return a completed diary.  They're looking for those likely to respond and trying to meet criteria for age cells.
Of course, this will not increase the accuracy or even the perceived accuracy of Arbitron ratings as they are based on recall or PPM measurement, both of which are flawed methodology from the get go.

Agreed 100%.
But I like the two dollars they sent me.
Real fresh and minty...
