We are in Season 21 at SNT!!!Opened in September of 2004 in Nashville, Michigan, Step N Time Dance Studio has established itself in a small community full of artistic talent. Step N Time is owned and operated by instructor, Kimberly (Knoll) Rodriguez. Kimberly has actively been a part of the dance community for 30 years and has been teaching and choreographing since 1997. She earned her Associate in Applied Arts degree from Lansing Community College where she directed and choreographed student-produced shows and faculty shows. Kimberly was also a member of the professional dance company at "Happendance" located in Okemos, Michigan. Since then, she has choreographed over 80 musicals and color guard shows. At Step N Time Dance Studio, we pride ourselves in being one of the most competitive education studios in the area. The direction and education of all students is a top priority at our studio. Every aspect of each individual's dance education at Step N Time is taught/guided by Kimberly Rodriguez, with the assistance of fellow dance teachers Amy Fisher, Katie Secor, Hannah Lajoye, Aly Olsen, Gloria Guernsey, Savannah Vanstee, Evan Fisher, Kierstyn Downs, Ella Tellkamp, Breanna Willard & Ashley Leimenstoll and the experience team and teaching assistants: Abigail Rickerd, Kierstyn Downs, Ella Tellkamp, & Abigail Pearson."At Step N Time Dance Studio, you will have the chance to grow not only as a dancer, but as an individual. It has been a dream of mine to own my own dance studio and now with celebrating our 21st year, it's proof that your dreams can become an awesome reality! I feel that with hard work and dedication to the art, you will see how dance can change your life." -Kimberly RodriguezMartha Graham once said, "Dance is the hidden language of the soul." We believe that that quote speaks mountains for what dance can do for you as an individual. So go ahead and dream big, and see what dance can do for your soul and life!
