St. Louis Cathedral Basilica
A quick  one-page view of my recent photos on black- Building began in 1907- 20 different artists covered 83,000 square feet with mosaics- 41.5 million pieces of glass- Mosaics started in 1912 and were completed in 1988- A prime example of Romanesque architecture. This is a 5-shot HDR.  I've always wanted to do an hdr of this most beautiful cathedral.  The longest shots were 30 seconds.   Saint Louis (St. Louis) Cathedral Basilica interior architecture mosai tiles.1k-8671_2_3_4_5 hdr tc b1 tr2 ca-5
