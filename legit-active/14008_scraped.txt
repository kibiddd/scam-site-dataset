Government of France
The Government of the French Republic (French: Gouvernement de la R√©publique fran√ßaise) exercises executive power in the French Republic. It is composed of the Prime Minister of the French Republic, who is the head of government, and both junior and senior ministers. Senior ministers are titled as Ministers (French: Ministres), whereas junior ministers are titled as Secretaries of State (French: Secr√©taires d'√âtat). A smaller and more powerful executive body, called the Council of Ministers (French: Conseil des ministres), is composed only of the senior ministers, though some Secretaries of State may attend Council meetings. The Council of Ministers is chaired by the President of the Republic, unlike the government, but is still led by the Prime Minister, who was officially titled as the President of the Council of Ministers (French: Pr√©sident du Conseil des ministres) during the Third and Fourth Republics. By comparison, the Government of France is equivalent to Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, whereas the Council of Ministers is equivalent to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

Minister (government)
A minister is a politician who holds significant public office in a national or regional government, making and implementing decisions on policies in conjunction with the other ministers. Some ministers are more senior than others, and are usually members of the government's cabinet. In some countries the head of government is designated the "prime minister". A government minister with responsibility for religion, such as the Israeli Minister of Religious Services, may be a layperson or cleric but the title should not be confused with the religious position of "Minister (Christianity)" or the activity of Christian ministry.
Etymology
In some countries and territories, including Hong Kong, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States, holders of some posts equivalent to ministries are called  secretaries of state, sometimes referred to simply as secretaries (e.g., the Home Secretary).
The term "minister" is also used in diplomacy with the quite different meaning of second-level diplomats (heads of legations).
The term minister comes from Middle English, deriving from the Old French word ministre, originally minister in Latin, meaning "servant, attendant", which itself was derived from the word 'minus' meaning "less".

France pension reform: Government presents programme to council of ministers ‚Ä¢ FRANCE 24 English
The French government is presenting a bill on Monday that foresees broad changes to the pension system that will notably push back the legal retirement age from 62 to 64. Unions aren't happy, and more than 1 million people took to the streets last week to reject the measure. More strikes and protest action are planned Jan. 31, and probably beyond. FRANCE 24's French Politics Editor Marc Perelman tells us more.

The French government is presenting a bill on Monday that foresees broad changes to the pension system that will notably push back the legal retirement age from 62 to 64. Unions aren't happy, and more than 1 million people took to the streets last week to reject the measure. More strikes and protest action are planned Jan. 31, and probably beyond. FRANCE 24's French Politics Editor Marc Perelman tells us more.

Two French government ministers have announced their opposition to a potential #takeover of the country's biggest supermarket chain #Carrefour by the Canadian group Couche-Tard. The two companies announced they were in preliminary talks on a deal earlier this week. France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said a takeover¬†was an issue of "food sovereignty". His ministry would need to approve any deal affecting the food distribution sector. Also today, how carmakers are trying to cut the cost of electric vehicles for consumers.

Government of France
The Government of the French Republic (French: Gouvernement de la R√©publique fran√ßaise) exercises executive power in the French Republic. It is composed of the Prime Minister of the French Republic, who is the head of government, and both junior and senior ministers. Senior ministers are titled as Ministers (French: Ministres), whereas junior ministers are titled as Secretaries of State (French: Secr√©taires d'√âtat). A smaller and more powerful executive body, called the Council of Ministers (French: Conseil des ministres), is composed only of the senior ministers, though some Secretaries of State may attend Council meetings. The Council of Ministers is chaired by the President of the Republic, unlike the government, but is still led by the Prime Minister, who was officially titled as the President of the Council of Ministers (French: Pr√©sident du Conseil des ministres) during the Third and Fourth Republics. By comparison, the Government of France is equivalent to Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, whereas the Council of Ministers is equivalent to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.
