Place Bonaventure and De la Gauchetiere street.
Place Bonaventure is the node of the underground city that is the junction between the north-south central axis, through Central Station, Place Ville Marie, and Centre Eaton, a western branch, through Bonaventure Metro, under 1000 de la Gauchetiere, to old Windsor Station, the Bell Centre, and Lucien L'Allier commuter train station, and a newer eastern axis towards Complexe Guy Favreau.
It is also home to the main Hilton hotel in downtown Montreal, and a convention centre.
You can also see the Bell Tower in the background, and one of the small turret towers at the base of 1000 de la Gauchetiere at the right of the photo.
