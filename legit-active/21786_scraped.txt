Ask him!ConnectionsReferenced in Fear, Panic & Censorship (2000)User reviews11ReviewFeatured review7/10Quite shockingA movie that's certainly confronting by the standards of the early 1960s (some scenes are still uncomfortable to watch), I can safely say that the Ones were indeed Warped. It follows a young juvenile offender who's released from custody and sets about wreaking havoc, seemingly motivated by equal parts revenge and boredom.It's only about 75 minutes long, so it does more or less get away with just being a premise, and not feeling too dependent on plot until the final act, when things naturally get a bit more dramatic. Much of the film rushes by with a maniacal energy, and viewers aren't spared a great deal when it comes to seeing what the main character and two of his equally warped friends get up to. It's one of many crime/dramas from Japan in the early 1960s that touch upon rebellion and a disaffected population of youths, and I think it explores all that stuff well.Its brevity and aggressive directness make it hard to elaborate much further than that. I was alarmed in what I think were the right ways, and though it wasn't enjoyable, it was engaging. It's well-made for its time, and the visuals are nice and stylish. It definitely fits in with that new wave sort of feel, be it Japanese new wave or new wave in general (I can't be bothered to look up dates or specifics at this point... it's late, I'm tired, and I'm going to feel warped tomorrow if I don't rest soon).Jeremy_UrquhartAug 20, 2023PermalinkTop picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 3, 1960 (Japan)Country of originJapanLanguagesJapaneseEnglishAlso known asThe Weird Love MakersProduction companyNikkatsuSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime1 hour 15 minutesColorBlack and WhiteSound mixMonoAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was The Warped Ones (1960) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page
