Andrea J. Smith
Andrea J. Smith is a classically trained painter and educator whose work marries classical still life and portraiture with contemporary style and technique. Having spent more than 35 years overseas, away from her Australian roots, she has exhibited internationally and founded schools in both New York and Rome. Her latest exhibition will show around 100 works from her various studios; a journey of perennial musings recorded in paint.
