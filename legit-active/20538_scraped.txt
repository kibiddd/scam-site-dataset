74kCaptain Franklin Buchanan, 1800-1874, American naval officer, b. Baltimore. Appointed a midshipman in 1815, Buchanan rose to be a commander in 1841. He was chief adviser to Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft in planning the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis and was its first superintendent (184547). In Sept., 1861, he took the rank of captain in the Confederate navy, commanding the Virginia (formerly the Merrimack) against the Union blockading squadron in Hampton Roads (Mar. 8, 1863). Wounded in that engagement, he took no part in the battle of the Monitor and Merrimack the next day. Promoted to ranking officer in the Confederate navy, he was forced to surrender to David G. Farragut in the battle of Mobile Bay (Aug. 5, 1864). Photo #: NH 61920-A. Photograph by Matthew Brady circa 1855-1861, mounted on a carte de visite.

On British Service
HMS Campbeltown (ex-USS Buchanan, DD-131), commissioned at Halifax, NS, as one of the first transfers, Campbeltown arrived at Devonport on 29. September 1940 and refitted there to 1 November 1940; a collision with Risoy the following day while on trials put her into dockyard hands at Liverpool until 24 November 1940. The ship then joined 17th Flotilla, Western Approached Command, but yet another collision this time with Comus on 3 December 1940 involved her in further repairs until 28 March 1941. During this period, she appears to have had a Polish contingent on board, whether for training or with intent to man the ship is not clear. On completion of repairs, Campbeltown became Dutch manned. Between April and late September 1941 Campbletown served with 7th Escort Group apart from one repair period from 9 June to 3 July 1941. At one stage, the Dutch Government wished to rename the ship Middelburg, but the request was refused. In late September 1941 Campbeltown reverted to British manning, and after working up with her new crew, joined 27th Escort Group for the West African convoy route. Defects and subsequent repairs kept her in dockyard hands at Devonport from late January 1942, and durng this period she was selected as an expendable vessel for use in a raid on the French coast. During her final Devonport refit she lost her third and fourth funnels. The two remaining were altered in diameter and given raked tops, and a 12pdr HA was mounted on the forecastle. Forward in the ship twenty-four depth charges were sealed into the hull to provide the demolition charge, and all other armament, stores etc were removed to lighten the ship. Light armour protection was fitted on the bridge and upper deck for the crew and embarked
Commandos, and a number of hand worked 20mm AA provided to give covering fire. In this guise, accompanied by a number of motor launches and MTBs and provided with night challenges and replies courtesy of Bletchley Park and Ultra decrypts, Campbeltown approached St Nazaire during the night of 28/29 March 1942, and succeeded in lodging herself in the caisson of the lock. The time fuzes of the charge did not operate as planned and, in the aftermath of the raid, the ship was photographed from varying angles and visited by a
large number of German personnel. These did not remain long, nor do they seem to have made  a proper inspection below decks for, at 1135 local time, Campbeltown exploded. The result was inevitable, with the lock empty and half tide outside, the caisson was damaged and forced open. It and the wreck of the Campbeltown were swept into the lock by a tidal wave, and very substantial casualties inflicted on the personnel around.

16kHMS Campbeltown, disguised as a German destroyer for the famous raid on St. Nazaire, France, in 1942. Campbeltown was built as USS Buchanan (DD 131), one of hundreds of "four piper" or "flush deck" destroyers constructed during the WWI era. Buchanan was one of 50 such ships transferred to the UK under the "Destroyers for Bases" deal, becoming HMS Campbeltown on 9 September 1940. She served the Royal Navy as an escort until early 1942, when she was assigned a role in the St. Nazaire raid.Joe Radigan
