Cornwall People First is a charity for adults with learning disabilities or autism throughout Cornwall
We are a user-led self advocacy charity. We support people to speak up for themselves and work closely with the services they receive to improve things, helping people to achieve the life they want.
We help each other. We speak up, campaigning and lobbying about things that are important to us. This means people with a learning disability or autism meeting up together to talk and have fun. We make friends. We meet other self advocates across the UK.
