The New Orleans VooDoo held its final audition for the 2011 VooDoo Doll Dance Team on Saturday at Mardi Gras World in front of over 300 spectators, and the field was narrowed down from 27-to-20 young ladies to represent the VooDoo this upcoming season.
“We have selected an amazing group of young women to represent the VooDoo, and we were thrilled to see so many VooDoo fans in attendance,” said Rachel Vicknair, Director of Corporate Sponsorships and the VooDoo Dolls. “We have already received several appearance requests and can’t wait to get the Dolls out and about in the community.”
The 20 ladies to make the team are: Jenna from Boutte, Jasmine from Kenner, Danielle from Metairie, Tia from New Orleans, Amanda from Meraux, Rayne from Mereaux, Nia from Baton Rouge, Brittanie from Marrero, Megan from Luling, Sabrina from Kenner, Ashley from Metairie, TaylorAnne from Los Angeles, Victoria from Montz, Shelley from Metairie, Abby from Des Allemands, Nicole from New Orleans, Jamie from Harvey, Brittney from Destrehan, Brittany from Thibodaux, and Brooke from Lafitte.
Of the 2011 VooDoo Doll Dance Team, five were former VooDoo Dolls: Jenna from Boutte, Jasmine from Kenner, Danielle from Metairie, Tia from New Orleans, and Amanda from Meraux.
“I’m very excited to be a VooDoo Doll again. There are a lot of things to look forward to this upcoming season, both on and off the field. The excitement is back,” said Jenna from Boutte.
“It just means everything to be a VooDoo Doll and to represent the New Orleans VooDoo this season. I’m so passionate about dancing and also the VooDoo being back! I’m very honored to be able to represent the team,” said Ashley from Metairie.
“I’m so happy to be able to dance for the VooDoo. The opportunity is awesome, and I’m very thankful to be selected. The season cannot begin soon enough,” said Nia of Baton Rouge.
