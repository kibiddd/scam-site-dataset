Donald lived in Kernersville, NC with his wife of fourteen years, Amy; and their two young girls: Payton and Ava. While owning and operating Tilley Landscaping Co. LLC; he also was a long time barber at Mt. Tabor Barber and Style Shop in Winston-Salem, NC. Donald was a very devoted and loving husband and father. His two beautiful girls were the love of his life. Everything he did was for his family. He was a very compassionate, determined, and hard-working man. He was very passionate about sports, especially the Tarheels. His blood was Carolina Blue! He took so much pride in all he did and always gave 110%. We are so very blessed to have had this short time on earth with him. He is now in heaven with his papa, building our home and landscaping one beautiful yard. And I' m sure he' s cutting some hair. He will be missed terribly by us all. He is survived by his wife, Amy Tilley; and their two young girls, Payton Anne and Ava Gail; parents, Dee Ann and Kenny Yontz and Donnie Tilley; grandparents, Gail Watson, Ken and Libby Yontz, and Betty Tilley; special uncle, Mickey Watson; Donald' s four brothers; Chad Yontz, Jamie Yontz (Crystal), Alex Yontz, and Don Johnson; and a sister and brother by marriage, Emily and Brian Kampschroeder. He was preceded in death by his two grandfathers, Billy Gray Watson and Junior Tilley. The family would like to thank the doctors and nurses at Forsyth Medical Center in the Neuro ICU unit for their love and support of Donald, and his family. God truly blessed the family with a wonderfully compassionate and wise staff that did above and beyond what anyone could ever ask, or hope for. Thank you for the care you gave to Donald as if he were your own. May God bless you all. A Private Family Service will be held at St. Mark United Methodist Church. The Rev. Hagan McClellan will be officiating. Friends and family will gather at the home of Kenny and Dee Ann Yontz. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to St. Mark UMC, c/o Mrs. Janie Hicks, PO Box 1275, King, NC 27021.

I cannot tell you how much he will be missed. I had been very ill several years ago and Donald always stopped me to ask about my health and to discuss Carolina sports. He was a blessing to me and to everyone around him.Maria HolbeinJune 13, 2009Mrs. Tilley, Donald cut our son's hair just the way we all liked it and he always looked forward to seeing him and speaking with him.

We have been praying for you and your girls as you grieve his passing.Greer CreedJune 8, 2009Family, Donald cut my hair for over 10 years, and I drove 70 miles round-trip to let him do so.

In that year he has become a great friend. He let me bring my boys to his house to fish several times and was always ready to talk football.  When I heard this morning I felt nothing but numbness. I cannot believe that he is gone. I am going to truely miss my "Buddy."Coach ScheibMay 29, 2009Our deepest sympathy is with you at this time.  Please know that your family is in our prayers and that of our church.Amanda, Randy, Allison & Riley MabeMay 28, 2009To my dearest family, some things I'd like to say...but first of all, to let you know, that I arrived okay.I'm writing this from heaven. Here I dwell with God above.Here, there's no more tears of sadness; here is just eternal love. Please do not be unhappy just because I'm out of sight. Remember that I'm with you every morning, noon and night. That day I had to leave you when my life on earth was through, God picked me up and hugged me and He said, "I welcome you." It's good to have you back again; you were missed while you were gone.As for your dearest family, they'll be here later on.I need you here badly; you're part of my plan.There's so much that we have to do, to help our mortal man. God gave me a list of things, that he wished for me to do.And foremost on the list, was to watch and care for you.And when you lie in bed at night, the day's chores put to flight.God and I are closest to you....in the middle of the night.When you think of my life on earth, and all those loving yearsbecause you are only human, they are bound to bring you tears.But do not 	be afraid to cry; it does relieve the pain.Remember there would be no flowers, unless there was some rain.I wish that I could tell you all that God has planned.But if I were to tell you, you wouldn't understand.But one thing is for certain, though my life on earth is o'er.I'm closer to you now, than I ever was before.There are many rocky roads ahead of you and many hills to climb;but together we can do it by taking one day at a time.It was always my philosophy and I'd like it for you too...that as you give unto the world, the world will give to you.If you can help somebody who's in sorrow and pain,then you can say to God at night......"My day was not in vain."And now I am contented....that my life has been worthwhile,knowing as I passed along the way, I made somebody smile.So if you meet somebody who is sad and feeling low,just lend a hand to pick him up, as on your way you go.When you're walking down the street, and you've got me on your mind;I'm walking in your footsteps only half a step behind.And when it's time for you to go.... from that body to be free,remember you're not going.....you're coming here to me.
