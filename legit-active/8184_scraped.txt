Johnny & Associates announces earthquake relief project, "Marching J", feat. all talents
TH STAFF
Johnny & Associates have announced the creation of an earthquake relief project called "Marching J", which will feature the participation of all Johnny & Associates talents.
The project was named by president Johnny Kitagawa, and the "J" stands for both 'Japan' and 'Johnny's'. �Mr. Kitagawa says, "I put the meaning of 'Let's walk together toward the recovery."
Although Johnny & Associates housed a relief unit, "J-FRIENDS", for 1995's Great Hanshin Earthquake, it was only comprised of TOKIO, KinKi Kids, and V6. This time, however, "Marching J" will involve all the agency's talents - it'll mark the first in-house collaborative project since the company's founding in 1962. Mr. Kitagawa explained, "It was that big of a disaster. We need to get together, and take actions to make our hearts as one." �He also revealed that there were many talents who were willing to do something for the disaster relief.
The first event for "Marching J" will be through a fundraiser, which will be hosted in front of the First Gymnasium at the Yoyogi National Stadium. The event will run from April 1st to the 3rd, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. �Including Johnny's Jr. boys (and trainees), there will be over 100 talents�participating�the event under the slogan, "Use our energy without using electricity". Talk segments will also be held at the event.
Mr. Kitagawa also stated that the project does not have a set time limit, nor will this be a one-time event. He said, "We will continue to do some kind of activity every month until the end."
