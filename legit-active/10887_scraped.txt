Don was proud to serve as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II after which, he settled in Toronto and worked for Bell Canada until his retirement. Donald loved God fervently and chose to live his life by example. He attended The People's Church for 50 years where he served as an elder and was a member of the choir for 35 years. Don also took great joy in supporting the missions and global outreach commissioned by the church. No matter his circumstances, Don never complained and had patience beyond measure. He was an extraordinary example of what it means to be a loving and committed husband throughout his 69 wonderful years with his best friend, Miriam. We are so proud and honoured to have had such a loyal and dedicated husband, father, grandfather and "super- baba" who was always so generous with his time, support and unconditional love. Donald is survived by his wife Miriam (nee Martin) and their children Catherine (John) Lindstrom and Don (Lorna) Ramsay. He will also be lovingly remembered by his grandchildren Josh (Kim) Lindstrom, Rebecca (Greg) Holohan, Jaclyn, Jessica and Valerie Ramsay, as well as great-grandchildren Caleb, Jesse, Ella, Ezra and Cate. Donald was predeceased by his siblings Alex, Florence, Violet and Fred. He will also be forever missed by his extended family and dear friends. The family will receive friends at Shepherd Village Visitation Centre, 3758 Sheppard Avenue East (west of Kennedy Road) from 7-9 P.M. on Tuesday, August 16. A celebration of Don's life will be held at Shepherd Village on Wednesday. For exact details, please telephone Chapel Ridge Funeral Home (905-305-8508). Interment Highland Memory Gardens.
