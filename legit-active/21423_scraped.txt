“CMRE showed me that there are people who care and will take the time to help others, and that’s exactly what they’ve done. CMRE has helped me through the entire process of paying off my healthcare bill, something I could have never been able to do on my own. Thank you so much for all your help and attention CMRE!”

“Our facility has been working with CMRE Financial for a few years now. This has taken the collection piece off of our plate and we have had nothing but great results with CMRE Financial, the percentage of return on the accounts are quite a bit higher than we expected. Their staff is always courteous, prompt and knowledgeable in the “collections” arena. From the beginning, we have had great confidence in CMRE Financial as our collection agency.”
