Pardon Our Dust: Revitalization Work at Oakmont and Franconia Rec Centers
The Fairfax County Park Authority is undertaking significant revitalization projects at Oakmont and Franconia Rec Centers to enhance pool air quality for swimmers and spectators. These efforts align with the county’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality in its facilities, fleet vehicles, and operations by 2040.
At Oakmont Rec Center, work is underway to upgrade the pool dehumidification system, with completion expected by April 2025, weather permitting. Patrons should expect occasional construction traffic. Crane operations are scheduled for April 3, April 10, and April 18. A scheduled pool outage will begin at 7 p.m. on March 31, with normal operations resuming on April 3. These improvements will significantly enhance air quality, creating a healthier and more comfortable environment for swimmers and spectators. Similar upgrades at Spring Hill Rec Center in spring 2024 have already demonstrated positive results.
At Franconia Rec Center, Phase I of the revitalization project will begin in mid-April and conclude by early May 2025, weather permitting. Crane operations will take place on April 14 and April 17. On April 14, the child care area will be blocked off until mid-morning, while on April 17, the women’s locker room, lower dance room and lower meeting room will be closed until mid-morning. Phase II, starting Aug. 18, will focus on fitness center heating, ventilation and air conditioning upgrades and pool ductwork renovations. These upgrades will improve ventilation and temperature control, ensuring a better experience for all users.
For a full list of available Rec Centers during construction, visit the Rec Center website.
For further details, contact the Public Information Office at parkmail@fairfaxcounty.gov.

Free Wellness Opportunities with Healthy Strides
Fairfax County Park Authority’s Healthy Strides program helps improve health equity and empowers residents to make informed decisions about their wellbeing. Make strides to improve your health and wellness from any location, for free, with the Healthy Strides Wellness Workshops and virtual fitness classes.
“Healthy Strides directly supports the mission of One Fairfax by providing equitable access to fitness programs and health education resources,” said Ryan Ross, Wellness Coordinator for Fairfax County Park Authority. This program strives to provide all residents with the resources and support they need to achieve optimal health. To help meet this goal, the program offers a comprehensive suite of free and accessible opportunities to learn and get active.
Virtual Fitness Classes
Residents can participate in weekly virtual fitness classes from the comfort of their own homes at no cost. Virtual fitness classes are held through Microsoft Teams; all that’s needed is to download the app on a phone or tablet. Get active virtually with our Pilates, yoga, tai chi, body sculpting and basic training classes that cater to diverse fitness levels and interests.
“I think it's a great program and allows those who are not able to get to the gym stay healthy and fit. I really appreciate the fact that I can work out anywhere if you have internet connection and join a class. And if you are immune compromised, it allows you to work out in the comforts of your own home without worrying about getting sick from those around you,” said one community participant.
Find the Virtual Community Fitness Classes calendar at the Healthy Strides website.
Wellness Workshops
In addition to fitness classes, Fairfax County Park Authority offers free, virtual wellness workshops. These regular workshops address critical health topics relevant to the community that align with national health observances. They provide practical guidance on forming healthy habits.
