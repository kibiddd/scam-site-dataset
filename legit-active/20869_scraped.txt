"We had a wonderful birthday celebration for my wife Trish! Everything was beautifully organized by Donna and her two assistants another Donna and Maritsa. From helping me select the delicious menu, to the reception of guests, to the serving of the food and the timing of the event as it unfolded - everything was just right!"
"The set up of the room was really attractive and welcoming, there was a generous amount of food - more than enough for everyone, everything was delicious but I especially recommend the quiches! And the service was excellent - highly recommended!~"

‚ÄúDelicious, cozy, understated local gem. It is more than a typical cafe. I had the braised short ribs; they melted in my mouth! An excellent meal-- half the price and better than an appetizer just a few doors down. This neighborhood spot has a friendly staff-- Sofia & Lauren had great recommendations. With good eats, affordable prices and sweet vibe, I'll be back. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. So glad to find Jean-Jacques.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of my favorite breakfast spots - I love eating outside! Excellent French toast!
Today, they really outdid themselves & made one of my favorite birthday cakes I have ever had in my 38 years!
Buche de Noel in cake style, instead of log!
It was incredible- the smooth, rich chocolate layers are delightful.‚Äù
