Haute 100 New York member Swizz Beatz is making things happen! From new father to world peace, Swizz still manages time to keep new and fresh music rolling out, like his new album “Haute Living” which is set to drop by the end of the year.
“My new album is Haute Living because that’s my art, fashion, music, and life style Haute means the highest level,” a statement made on his Twitter page. His art–that’s right, he is also a painter. Inspired by contemporary pop-artist Andy Warhol and Canadian artiste, Martin Messier, who is both a performer and video artist.
The album features some great collaborations, like his first single, “Everyday,” featuring Eve.
Others that will appear on his forthcoming album include Lenny Kravits, Lil’ Wayne, Bono, and Jay-Z. “We got this song–it’s me, Bono, and Kanye on this one song called ‘Skyscrapers.’ I recorded with Kanye in the studio and then I recorded with Bono in this actual studio right here,” reports Swizz to Paper Magazine.
Swizz is praised and very well respected in the music business, becoming one of the best producers and rappers in his field. His work proves to be successful, making killer beats on more than 100 million albums that have sold globally.
