I think I've gone as far as I can with the group we've got."There were genuine mistakes in the last three games, something that was not there in the previous matches."I probably half-thought about (stepping down) after Estonia away, but that wasn't something I would show to the press because I wanted to fulfil my promise to the players, to the board and to the supporters."Worthington refused to criticise the fans for their recent barracking of him, but called on them to put on a united front whenever a new man is appointed."The decision was not through supporter pressure because I can deal with that. It's a football decision that I think is right," he said."The question was asked of me at the outset 'would I turn my back on my country?'. I said no then and I was determined to see it through and that is what I've done."All I would say to the fans is to be behind the team."They are phenomenal supporters and the way they travel around Europe in huge numbers is second to none. From a players' point of view and from the manager's point of view that is much valued."Of course frustration and disappointment creeps into the game, I fully understand that. But the fans have been wonderful with me for many years as a player and up until recent they have been wonderful again as manager."Despite those words, Worthington sounded one worrying note of caution for the future.He suggested that recent mood surrounding the side - from the stands and from the local media - could end up driving away important players."The one thing I think supporters have to be careful of is that negativity around the football, and from some of the press," he said."If they're not careful they will switch some of our players off and they will pack it in."Representing your country is a fantastic honour but some people deal with situations better than others. Some might think 'I don't want to be around this mood, this feeling'."It's something that has been murmured and you wouldn't want to see players stepping away from honouring their country through those circumstances."When Windsor Park is bouncing it's a fantastic place to be but please remember, as the song goes, we're not Brazil, we're Northern Ireland. Sometimes that can be easily lost."Assistant manager Glynn Snodin and goalkeeping coach Fred Barber will also finish after tomorrow's match, while under-21 boss Steve Beaglehole's position will be reviewed at the end of the year.PAJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesCommentsMost PopularPopular videosSponsored FeaturesGet in touchContact usOur ProductsRegisterNewslettersDonateToday’s EditionInstall our appArchiveOther publicationsInternational editionsIndependent en EspañolIndependent ArabiaIndependent TurkishIndependent PersianIndependent UrduThe StandardExtrasPuzzlesAll topicsBetting OffersVoucher codesCompetitions and offersIndependent AdvertisingIndependent IgniteSyndicationWorking at The IndependentLegalCode of conduct and complaintsContributorsCookie policyDonations Terms & ConditionsPrivacy policyUser policiesModern Slavery StatementThank you for registeringPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in
