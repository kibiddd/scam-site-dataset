1998 Canadian Grand Prix
The 1998 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 7, 1998. The race, contested over 69 laps, was the seventh round of the 1998 Formula One season. It was won by Michael Schumacher, however the race is probably best remembered for the crash on the first lap involving Alexander Wurz, Jean Alesi and Jarno Trulli, which resulted in the race being red flagged and restarted, only for another collision to take place between Alesi and Trulli at the same corner, and the race being started once again under the safety car.
Report
Qualifying
In Montreal, David Coulthard secured his third pole position of the season. The Scotsman managed to do the fastest time at the very end of the session. Mika Häkkinen was very unlucky during the qualifying session. He encountered a lot of traffic during his quick laps. Michael Schumacher was third, and was happily surprised by his lap time which was only 0.2 seconds behind Coulthard's time. The night before qualifying, Eddie Irvine had released a comment saying that the Canadian Grand Prix would be crucial for Ferrari, with Schumacher expressing the same opinion.

1979 Canadian Grand Prix
The 1979 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on 30 September 1979 at Montreal.
During practice Niki Lauda announced his retirement from Formula One. Ricardo Zunino replaced him for the race. The organizers would not let the Alfa Romeo team compete unless they pre-qualified. They refused to do so but a compromise was reached where one of their drivers would be allowed to take part in practice. The other, Bruno Giacomelli, was not allowed to enter the race. The race turned into a close duel between Alan Jones and Gilles Villeneuve that continued the entire race.

World Open (snooker)
The World Grand Prix is a professional ranking snooker tournament. It had previously been known as the Professional Players Tournament, the LG Cup, the Grand Prix, the World Open and the Haikou World Open. During 2006 and 2007, it was played in a unique round-robin format, more similar to association football and rugby tournaments than the knock-out systems usually played in snooker. The knock-out format returned in 2008 with an FA Cup-style draw. The random draw was abandoned after the 2010 edition. The last champion is Judd Trump.
History
The tournament was created in 1982 as the Professional Players Tournament by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, in order to provide another ranking event. Ray Reardon beat Jimmy White by 10 frames to 5 in the final to win the first prize of £5,000.
In 1984 Rothmans started sponsoring the tournament, changing its name to the Grand Prix, and moved its venue to the Hexagon Theatre in Reading. The tournament has had various sponsors and venues since. Previous sponsors include LG Electronics, who took over in 2001 and changed the tournament's name to the LG Cup. After LG withdrew their sponsorship, the Grand Prix name was revived for 2004 and was sponsored by totesport. Between 2006 and 2008 the event was sponsored by Royal London Watches.

Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)
The Grand Prix is an award of the Cannes Film Festival bestowed by the jury of the festival on one of the competing feature films. It is the second-most prestigious prize of the festival after the Palme d'Or. Prior to its creation, the Special Jury Prize held the "second place".
Name
Since 1995, the official name of the award has been simply the Grand Prix, but it has had two other names since its creation in 1967: Grand Prix Spécial du Jury (1967-1988), and Grand Prix du Jury (1989-1994).
In addition, the award should not be confused with the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, which is the previous name of the Palme d'Or, the highest prize of the Cannes Film Festival.

2000 Canadian Grand Prix
The 2000 Canadian Grand Prix (formally the XXXIIX Grand Prix Air Canada) was a Formula One motor race held on 18 June 2000 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal, Canada. It was the seventh round of the 2000 Formula One season and the 38th Canadian Grand Prix. The 69-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from pole position. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Giancarlo Fisichella third for the Benetton team.
Michael Schumacher started from pole position alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled for first place until Coulthard served a 10-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello to take the lead until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.

Go onboard with Sebastian Vettel's BMW Sauber F1.07 for a quali lap around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the 2007 United States Grand Prix.
For not risking another concussion so close to the huge crash from the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, The FIA medical delegate forced the Polish driver to take a rest for this weekend, although the medical exam was OK.
Kubica was replaced for the USGP weekend by the 19-year-old Formula Renault 3.5 driver Sebastian Vettel (back at the time he was leading the championship) and the next day, he clinches the first point finish that he made the youngest point scorer in F1 (broken in 2015 by a 17-year-old Max Verstappen in Malaysia).

1998 Canadian Grand Prix
The 1998 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 7, 1998. The race, contested over 69 laps, was the seventh round of the 1998 Formula One season. It was won by Michael Schumacher, however the race is probably best remembered for the crash on the first lap involving Alexander Wurz, Jean Alesi and Jarno Trulli, which resulted in the race being red flagged and restarted, only for another collision to take place between Alesi and Trulli at the same corner, and the race being started once again under the safety car.
Report
Qualifying
In Montreal, David Coulthard secured his third pole position of the season. The Scotsman managed to do the fastest time at the very end of the session. Mika Häkkinen was very unlucky during the qualifying session. He encountered a lot of traffic during his quick laps. Michael Schumacher was third, and was happily surprised by his lap time which was only 0.2 seconds behind Coulthard's time. The night before qualifying, Eddie Irvine had released a comment saying that the Canadian Grand Prix would be crucial for Ferrari, with Schumacher expressing the same opinion.
