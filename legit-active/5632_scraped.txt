“Yves is multi-talented, I worked with him in IT few years ago and was impressed by his knowledge and abilities. Once he switched in the Financial Advisor role, I had no doubt that he would be able to master this very different subject as thoroughly as he did in IT. And I did not hesitate to become his customer right away.
When he asked me to do a Risk Tolerance Test, I was not really thrilled (I did these many times) but he managed to surprise me again by having a very detailed test and I felt that this one was much better to truly assess my risk tolerance than the so-called tests used by other firms. In short, Yves is bright, dedicated and reliable!”
Benoit H. Dicaire 🇨🇦
“Yves is a self-started and motivated individual, who always strives to exceed any expectation. He was constantly committed to his job making sure tasks were done on time while keeping the highest standards.”

ANNOUNCEMENT: DTLab launches the Digital Credentials Training Program to fight cybercrime, improve privacy protection and accelerate digital inclusion.
Our two courses - Digital Credentials 101: Fundamentals and Digital Credentials 102: Introduction to Implementation - are for organizations, governments and individuals embarking on their digital credential journeys. The new program is the first of its kind in Canada and is offered in both official languages.
According to the Canadian Anti-fraud Centre, financial losses from fraud alone have more than tripled from $165 million in 2020 to $554 million in 2023. In response to this, our new Digital Credentials Training Program provides participants with the necessary knowledge to better protect themselves and their organizations using digital credentials.
After taking these courses participants will be able to:
- Understand digital identity and credentials at an introductory level
- Adopt a common language and terminology with fellow participants
- Be able to think critically about digital identity and credential programs and solutions
In doing so, DTLab is contributing to the ongoing fight against cybercrime and fraud.
Learn more about our course and register today! English and French cohorts kick off this fall.

Cybersecurity is the responsibility for each and everyone.
It can be very frustrating for citizens who took care of their data security and privacy for decades to see some 3rd party entities or companies or even the government leaking data so often.
We may have to rethink our data security as a nation.

Eugene K. Poma of EP Services our partner will attend this event as well ❗ ❗ ❗
Monday, November 11 · 3:30 - 5pm GMT, Skills for Change will be hosting a webinar called Credit Basic with Credit Canada.
They will be tackling the following topics :
1- The specific case of credit card usage and why it is important to understand the necessity to pay off credit card balances regularly, in order to stay in the grace period and pay no interest.
2- The dangers of high-cost credit. Knowing what kind of credit-granting organizations that should be avoided e.g. payday lending organizations.
3- The importance of building a good credit history – Why it is important; How to check your credit; What you need to know, and need to do, in order to have a credit history that is good enough.

This week, #FNFA will be in Ottawa, ON advocating for #Monetization as an innovative solution to accelerate infrastructure funding and development.
Why #Monetization? The current pay-as-you-go model has failed and can only build a few infrastructure projects each year. Monetization would build many more projects and could help close the estimated $349.2 billion-dollar infrastructure gap, something the federal government committed to do by 2030. That is simply not possible under current policy. In fact, it would take about 130 years using the current model.
Stay tuned for updates on our progress! Learn more: https://lnkd.in/gwckaH4K

Cette semaine, l'#AFPN sera à Ottawa, en Ontario, pour plaider en faveur de la #monétisation en tant que solution innovante pour accélérer le financement et le développement des infrastructures.
Pourquoi la #monétisation ? Le modèle actuel de financement par répartition a échoué et ne permet de réaliser que quelques projets d'infrastructure par an. La monétisation permettrait de réaliser beaucoup plus de projets et de combler le déficit d'infrastructures estimé à 349,2 milliards de dollars, ce que le gouvernement fédéral s'est engagé à faire d'ici à 2030. Cela n'est tout simplement pas possible dans le cadre de la politique actuelle. En fait, il faudrait environ 130 ans avec le modèle actuel.

In today's digital age, adopting a cloud smart strategy is crucial, especially for the public sector in Canada.
A cloud smart strategy emphasizes cost efficiency, allowing public sector entities to make the most of their IT budgets. Unlike the traditional reliance on hyperscalers, which can often lead to unpredictable and ballooning costs, a cloud smart approach ensures that agencies only pay for what they use. This optimized expenditure allows for better allocation of resources, reducing the financial burden on taxpayers.
In this video, our CEO Craig McLellan talks about how ThinkOn’s cloud smart strategy is specifically designed to support the public sector in Canada.
Discover how our business outcomes can help your organization achieve its goals with unparalleled efficiency and security.

encrypt their controlled goods data when uploading or transferring data to the cloud
restrict access to their controlled goods data to individuals who have been security assessed under section 15 of the Controlled Goods Regulations
report security breaches affecting their cloud-stored controlled goods data to the Controlled Goods Program

register with the Controlled Goods Program to be able to store controlled goods data
implement a security plan detailing the controls used to protect the physical assets and locations for their cloud solutions as well as the cloud environment itself
ensure that only employees who have been security assessed under section 15 of the Controlled Goods Regulations have access to a client’s controlled goods data when providing technical assistance
