"Ugh, It's so creepy." Then, she gets out her tape recorder.For Brown, the ugly and the beautiful are often so closely entwined that what sounds wrong in the moment might be put to a useful purpose later, and vice versa. For her most recent album, "World So Sweet," she recorded the voices of people she met on the street for a song called "How to Make a World Class Gymnast."Read one line at a time, the lyrics don't seem so bad. When you put them all together, the effect is a bunch of folks with good intentions making a really spooky statement. Listening to the rest of the album, it's easy to see that as a metaphor for life as Brown sees it.She seems to find hope in sticking it to humanity, and "World So Sweet" is filled with portraits of characters that range from the sympathetic to the downright skewering. That they're communicated through Brown's clear, sweet voice and atmospheric arrangements layers on the meaning and emotional nuance.As she prepared herself for an upcoming show at Mississippi Studios, we tried to sort it all out.Q: World So Sweet has a song called "How to Make a World Class Gymnast." What inspired you to record all those different people speaking the lyrics, and what do you think it added to the album?A:My hope was that it would create an effect that would give the listener a general sensory hit, all at once. I wanted it to create the kind of confusion I see involved in molding young lives and raising kids up -- the good and the bad sides of that. Kids are so vulnerable and at the mercy of grownups, especially within their families. As a culture, we idealize families but don't pay a lot of attention to what happens when dangerous or even just poorly coping folks -- most of us! -- get their less-than-healthy hands on these little sensitive lives. The lyric repeats "You get them when they're young and you bend them," then "First an arm. Then a leg. Then the heart. Then the head." I had the nice folks of the Woodstock neighborhood read the lines from a book in which I'd written one line per page, flipping pages so they couldn't read ahead. I wanted the menace in the lyric to be softened or reinforced by the individual sound of these voices. I tried to get a good mix of young, in between and old. The overall effect to me is of such kindness, helpfulness from these voices. They kind of break my heart! But when you stop and consider what they're saying -- a helpful how-to on how to bend children (and in gymnastics, that's extreme bending), it's unnerving. I hope.Q: The early songs on the album seem to groove and stretch out, with oft-repeated refrains, whereas the later songs seemed more terse and clipped, leaving the listener hanging. Was this intentional? Do you think the listener has more patience at the beginning of the album? How do the song forms evolve into their final states?A:One of my favorite parts of putting together an album is figuring out the order and transitions. I get very, very strong ideas of what should go where, and how. Actually, in the process of making the album, it always seems to sort itself out in that regard. It's just a feeling. So, no, no rhyme or reason in the way you're thinking. I hadn't noticed, by the way! But yes, an order determined by natural flow and by the story, by what feels right. I'm a pretty selfish writer/album maker. I'm most concerned with just suiting myself and what sounds and feels right to me. I completely understand if listeners have no patience with me from beginning to end, all the way through.Q: Last year, you gathered 50 people at a piano store to play F chords. Did you know that was going to turn into the intro to your next album? How did it become what it is?A:Yes, I did know. I was rehearsing at Sherman Clay and saw this Candyland of pianos -- 50 of them! -- and turned to Jeff Stuart Saltzman (with whom I've recorded the last five albums) and said, "If I get 50 people in here to play these, can you record it?" He said, "Yes." I had already written the intro "Sweetness on Earth" and planned to use it. It just broadened to accommodate the 50 pianos. That was a really amazing and magical evening. The Portlanders who turned out were a special bunch, and so mixed. Experienced pianists, novices, people who'd never touched a piano, friends, strangers. And they could sing! It was the most beautiful sound. I'll always be thankful for that night and those lovely people.Q: What kinds of keyboards/pianos do you play on the album? How important is the tone/timbre of the instrument to you? Do you have to make sacrifices in that regard when you perform the material live?A:I play piano (both Jeff's and Secret Society's), Pro-One, various other synths, Mellotron, Companion Organ (my little cheap one), toy pianos. Oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some. I also play guitar and a lot of percussion. Tone and timbre are very important to me, but it's Jeff who's the biggest stickler on that count. He's responsible for getting those great piano sounds. He's always thinking about sound, from the get-go, early on, and is a fiend about mic-ing -- getting the right mic/tone. Then, when it comes to mixing, he's very picky. He's rightly regarded as one of the best around, partly because of his incredible attention to sound. But Jeff's talented in so many regards. I count on it and get the benefit of that on my albums.Performing live is such a problem. Sacrifices, yes. And I've worked with some really fine sound people. My dream is to just have my very own so we could work out a good consistent system. Oh, Santa, please. I prefer having a real piano, but the down side to that is that they don't mic as well, live. My HoJos keyboard (as I call it) always feels rinky-dinky and cheesy to me, but it's definitely easier to make heard on stage.Q: Darkness and discord seem to play important roles in your work, both in the lyrics and music. Why is that?Just my brain, I think. And whatever's gone into making me up; my life experience and however I've absorbed it. Isn't that always it? I'm a bit of an Eeyore and I suspect I always would have been, naturally, even without the things that wound up molding and shaping (bending) me. Those forces are potent and sticky and I still struggle with the fallout. But the weird thing is, I'm actually a very hopeful pessimist. Or realist, more like. I -- maybe because of my bad experiences and skeptical view of the people and the world -- am profoundly grateful, most of the time. I whine, but mainly I have an overwhelming appreciation and thankfulness for my life and especially for those people I love, now. I see the world as heartbreakingly ugly, awful, and beautiful. But every day, beautiful.Q: PJ Harvey has talked about people confusing her personality with the characters in her songs. Do you get that from fans? How much of your lyrics are fictional and how much are nonfiction? How much are you and how much are what you see around you?A:Well, a lot are not about me. But they also are me. If I'm telling a story about something or somebody not me, it's usually because something in that story resonated with me or matched up with what's stewing in me. I'm telling the story but it often may be less about the specific story and more about something it says about some larger characteristic of humanity that fascinates, concerns or interests me. I find myself returning again and again to issues of injustice, the unprotected and vulnerable, lies we all tell ourselves (denial), social contracts/thumbscrews, cherished myths, religion and other institutionsthat guide and twist so many lives, human hubris and other jolly qualities.Q: Your songs seem to be as much about creating an atmosphere and telling a sonic story as telling a story with words. What drives that?A:Firstly, thank you. That's one of the nicest things you could've said to me. I care equally about the music and the words and it matters a lot to me how they complement each other. I love that work! It's one of my chief joys in songwriting. It's like figuring out a puzzle, making the words and music really work together to create a stamp, an overall impression I hope to achieve. It really does take both. There's a flow to a sentence and a trick to getting a thought to match meter without sounding forced or clunky. I love working that kind of thing out -- it's like brain exercise. I love words and rooting around in my head for the words to express something in just the right way to fit the music. Or, conversely, working out music to host the words, just so. Sometimes I choose words just for how good they feel to say, the vowels and consonants, flowing one into the other, for how they bump up against each other. It's definitely a sensory thing but also involves brain. Love it.Q: Given the sometimes theatrical feeling of your music, have you ever considered writing a musical or doing some kind of stage show based on your songs?A:My sister, Katie Taylor (recently retired executive and artistic director ofOpera Theater Oregon) and I have long entertained ourselves with writing really bad musicals. We torture my dear husband, Jay, with them. Have yet to finish any of them but have partial versions of "Oh, Hell!" (based on Dante's Inferno) and a musical version of "Willard!" set in Umatilla. I wrote some really pretty songs for that last one -- very "Oklahoma!" -- and would like to actually finish it. I can definitely see doing that, and also movie soundtrack work or a short opera.Q: Animal imagery plays a big role on the new album, from the stingray on the cover to the anemones, carrion birds, "Kitty" and taxidermied heads inside. What roles do these animals play in your songs? Do you feel that animals tend to elicit different responses in your listeners?A:Fellow creatures are so vulnerable and exist at the whim of ... humanity. I've always loved animals, and rescue bees and spiders and snakes, etc. My neighbor had a stuffed possum when I was little -- too young to know it was a cruel joke. I loooooved that possum and would carryit around and snuggle it and they'd laugh at me. I think they taxidermied it to look especially repulsive. That is a weird human thing -- shooting animals when they're sleeping on a branch or something and then posing them in a "RAWWWRRR!" pose. I still love possums and don't understand why people hate them so much. The animals in these particular songs are more symbolic of certain human types. What's the opposite of anthropomorphizing? I worry a lot about the other things that live here with us. That whole still-pervasive "dominion over the creatures" thing really bothers and concerns me. Who the hell do we think we are?Q: You mentioned that Mercy in Nebraska is about the Safe Haven Law. Talk about how that became a song. How often do politics/current events creep into your music, and are there any that are currently creeping in? A:They usually creep in because they stir up something already in me, churning around. Sometimes I'm only half-aware of it and the writing of the song really brings it out. In the case of the Safe Haven Law in Nebraska, reading about it and the awful unintended consequences (whole families being dumped at local hospitals) horrified me and (darkly) amused me, because of what it so boldly revealed about people -- we sad, awful, desperate people. Here we are in the Heartland, cradle of home and family and apple pie, and when given the option, scads of parents are abandoning whole families of 6, 7, 8 children in one single, swift dump. What does that mean? I felt so horrible for the children. But I could also understand the desperate parents. I don't sympathize with dumping your kids. Those poor kids. But there's so much rosy mythology surrounding parenting and family in America. This was just one rare, glaring rip in the fabric that showed our dirty little pedestrian petticoat. In varying degrees, I believe almost all people who have children wish at some point that they hadn't, if even for a moment. But it's blasphemy to admit that. Things like that always grab me. Those qualities are in all of us. What makes them come out?Q: What can you tell us about this upcoming show at Mississippi Studios?Coming up: Rachel Taylor Brown, The Brothers Young, Michael the BlindWhen:9 p.m. FridayWhere:Mississippi Studios, 3939 N. Mississippi Ave.Tickets:$10,www.mississippistudios.comWebsite:www.racheltaylorbrown.comA:I'm very excited to have the wonderfulMichael the BlindandBrothers Youngplaying the show. These are good eggs, a whole carton of good eggs, and wonderful musicians. I have some wonderful people playing with me, too -- Ben Landsverk, Leigh Marble, Jeff Langston, Liz Savage, Lisa Stringfield, my sister Katie, Tricia Beck, Todd Bayles. I'm not sure if we're going to get to larnin' Mt. Athos (a new song). I cut rehearsal time a wee bit short and we're all sort of cramming this week. But I'd love to do it; if not now, soon! I wrote it after watching a 60 Minutes show on a very old monastery on a very beautiful Greek island (or isthmus?). They don't allow women on the island, anywhere, at all. Which just made me want to go spread my girl germs all over it. Really? You think none of these men's heads might be turned even more by a handsome lad than a woman? Hmm? Anyway, I wrote this song.--Jake Ten PasIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
