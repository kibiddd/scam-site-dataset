Lessons
At Artisans Stables we strive for excellence in riding skills, horsemanship, and safety. All of our horses are well versed in teaching beginnersâbuilding their confidence as they learnâbut they are also suitable for those ready to compete in rated show series. Our team of trainers has been developing great riders and horses with a goal oriented approach on the âAâ circuit shows for over 20 years. Our trainersâ ability to motivate while maintaining professionalism and high standards of sportsmanship is what makes us so successful.
Individual lessons are $90 per hour, or $70 each if 2 or more per week, not guaranteed same horse each lesson. 24 hour cancelation notice required if you wish to recieve a make up lesson.
Training
Artisans Stables' training philosophy is based on a strong foundation. We believe that dressage is essential to good horsemanship, bringing balance and strength to horse and rider. After an introductory/evaluation lesson, we will develop a lesson program with our client that will meet the individual needs of both horse & rider. Full training packages is available for clients with their own horses, or for riders who lease a horse from Artisans.
Artisans Stables offers full board and training for $1650 per month. Price does not include supplements. Leasing is also available (pricing varys depending on horse).
