Matt Ryan (rower)
Matt Ryan (born 23 June 1984 in Sydney) is a retired Australian rower who has represented at two Olympic Games.
Ryan competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics, where he won a silver medal in Coxless four. In London 2012 he rowed in the Australian men's eight which placed 6th.
Ryan began his rowing at The King's School, Parramatta and was part of the First VIII crew in 2001 and 2002 that won the AAGPS Head of the River.  The 2001 crew which also contained fellow future Australian senior national team rowers Nicholas Hudson and Sam Loch, also went on to win the Barrington Cup to be crowned National Schoolboy champions.  In addition to this, the 2001 crew won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.  In 2002, Ryan stroked the Australian Junior Coxed Four to a gold medal at the World Junior Championships in Trakai, Lithuania.
Continuing to move through the underage ranks, Ryan was a bronze medallist in 2003 in the Men's Eight at the Nations Cup regatta (now the World Under 23 Championships) in Belgrade, Serbia.   The following year, Ryan returned to the top of the podium at the World Under 23 Regatta in Poznan, Poland in an all-New South Wales, Coxed Four.

by: Matthew Ryan
Walking outside our old houseTragically dressed trying to coax your ghost outThere's some things I'm ready to confrontSome that I didn't do and some that I've doneAngry inside over a cup of black teaYour watery eyes and perfume were choking meBut I don't need to tell you how it wentExcept that all things beautiful are blurred into sadnessSadly love, know it will really let you inI need your little hands to hold my expression'Cause I've been cursed until the kingdom comesTo always have and miss someoneTo always have and miss someoneIt was one bedroom with a dog in the thornI remember thinking about dad as I was walking out the doorLooking back seeing the girl you never should beHeartbroke and poor lovesick and lonelySadly love, know it will really let you inI need your little hands to hold my expression'Cause I've been cursed until the kingdom comesTo always have and miss someone
