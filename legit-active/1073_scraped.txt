According to prosecutors, the brothers stormed into the station after learning that a third brother, Steven Jean-Babets, 22, was being held on a marijuana charge and traffic violations.Gilbert and Sunderland police officer Gary Sibilia testified Wednesday that the defendants arrived at the station after Gilbert had called to inform them he had Steven Jean-Babets in custody. Sibilia, a former Northfield police chief, said he picked up Steven earlier that day but had concerns about sending him to the Franklin County House of Correction because of his mental state.
"I feared it would not be the right place for him to go," Sibilia said.
After a clerk magistrate set bail at $270, Gilbert telephoned Kenneth Jean-Babets to tell him they had his brother in custody and ask if he could come up with bail. Jean-Babets replied that he was going to kill Gilbert and his family, according to testimony.
A surveillance camera shows Kenneth and Patrick entering the lobby of the public safety complex shortly afterward. The officers testified that there was a knock on the door, and when Gilbert opened it, Kenneth Jean-Babets said, "You have something of mine," referring to the marijuana confiscated from Steven. The brothers then attacked the officers, according to testimony.
Sibilia said he was warding Patrick Jean-Babets off when he saw a knife slide across the floor.
"That's when I really feared for my life," he said.
Gilbert wrote in his initial report that Kenneth moved the knife toward him, but under cross-examination by defense lawyer Barry Auskern, he acknowledged that the defendant never lunged at him.
Prosecutor Jeremy Bucci played several videotapes for the jury, including one that showed Steven Jean-Babets, in lock-up, reacting to the fight outside the room.
After throwing his sneakers against the wall, Jean-Babets hides under the bench to which he's handcuffed, saying, "I'm down!" when he hear the officers command his brothers to get on the floor. He repeatedly says, "I'm sorry," "I don't want to fight with you," and "I played the wrong card" as chaos ensues in the other room.
The officers subdued Kenneth and Patrick Jean-Babets after several minutes. Gilbert testified that he hurt his back in the scuffle and had to be treated briefly at a hospital.
Kenneth, Patrick and Steven Jean-Babets and a fourth brother are all biological siblings who were taken away from their birth parents at an early age by the state Department of Social Services. Like their biological parents, Kenneth, Patrick and Steven Jean-Babets have mental health issues, according to their defense lawyers.
The four brothers were adopted by David Jean and Donald Babets, whose law suit against the state over its foster care regulations paved the way for gay couples to adopt in Massachusetts.
The case is expected to go to the jury on Thursday.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
