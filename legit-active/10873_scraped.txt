Matt AndersonU.S. Men's National Team
"I always feel like I have to be at my best. That‚Äôs the way our team runs and the way that I operate, to give everything I have whether that‚Äôs me serving, playing defense, or passing. The guys really helped me today. It kept me positive." - after defeating Brazil in the 2024 Olympic quarterfinals
Miles PartainU.S. Beach National Team
‚ÄúWe are just trying to be aggressive and be the best we are capable of, win or lose. Our vision is farther than any one game, even here at the Olympics. Playing before thousands of fans is awesome and something I will remember for the rest of my life.‚Äù - after winning their Round of 16 match in the 2024 Olympics
Annie DrewsU.S. Women's National Team
‚ÄúPool A was such a dogfight and it really showed us anything can happen. As we‚Äôve gone on in this tournament, we‚Äôve gotten better and better at not getting rattled.‚Äù - after defeating Poland in the Olympic quarterfinals
