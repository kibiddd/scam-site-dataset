We were beyond impressed with our recent transportation experience for our company party. Not only were they prompt and friendly, but their staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and enjoyment. Fernando, our driver, deserves special recognition for his professionalism and helpfulness. We eagerly anticipate future bookings with their company.

We decided last minute that we needed to book transportation for our wedding party and had to scramble to get things lined up a week before. Paula at Silver Star was quick to respond and a pleasure to work with. We were able to lock everything in 4 days before our wedding and it all went perfectly! The shuttle was on time and clean. Our driver was so nice and helped us make an extra stop with ease. We couldn‚Äôt be happier with the service Silver Star provided!

We used Silver Star for our wedding day transportation. We could not have asked for a better company! They were on time and patient! The drivers got us where we needed to be and were pleasant to work with. The 30 passenger party bus was great for our bridal party. It was spacious, clean and stocked with cups, ice and Prosecco! I would highly recommend Silver Star for any event or any of your transportation needs. Melissa was also very helpful, responsive and flexible when planning out the transportation for the wedding day and getting us what we needed!

Mario and his team were wonderful! They were professional and timely. We even added a second vehicle just a few weeks ahead of our wedding and they were happy to accommodate. We can‚Äôt thank Silver Star enough for handling our transportation needs on such an important day!

So glad we went with Silver Star for our wedding day! It was one thing I needed to just happen seamlessly on our special day and Silver Star took care of that. My driver on the way to the church even came in to the church and fluffed my train and veil before I walked down the aisle ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt have to do that and it was such a kind gesture. Afterwards he poured us a champagne toast and rolled out a red carpet! The larger limo was wonderful as well. Top notch class and service all the way!

Wonderful experience! ‚Äì We had a great time on our limo city tour. The ride was clean and comfortable, the driver was knowledgeable, and it was a fun experience.

Private Limo Tour of Dyker Heights ‚Äì Miguel was our driver for the evening. Great communication from the company and him. I received a text when he was in route to our hotel. He also called when he was a few minutes away. I cannot say enough good things about Miguel! He was so personable, courteous and made sure we had a wonderful evening‚Ä¶.Do not miss this opportunity! So much more enjoyable booking a private tour. Well worth the money!
K F - Canton of Basel, Switzerland
A Perfect Experience! ‚Äì My daughters and I reserved a car in order to tour the Christmas lights in Dyker Heights (Brooklyn). Our driver (Miguel) was prompt to pick us up at our hotel and very professional throughout the night. He gave us some tips on houses to look for and took a picture of our group at one of the stops. He was flexible with the time we wanted to spend walking the neighborhood and never seemed to be in a rush. It was a great evening that we will never forget!

Fantastic Holiday Lights ‚Äì My wife and I had a great time on the NYC holiday lights tour. Mario was a fantastic guide and made us feel like family as he took us around town. He went out of his way to make sure that we saw everything we wanted. I would highly recommend joining Silver Star for a tour.
mmnmrn4 (Couple) - Hamburg
Silver Star was exceptional! Our driver went above and beyond time and time again. He even assisted with opening the church doors for my bride and caring for her train throughout the entrance. They were not only on time but arrived a little early and were accommodating in every way! I highly recommend silver star for your occasion!
Danyela B
Working with Silver Star was great, and their divers did an excellent job the day of our wedding to make sure everything went well and everyone got to our wedding and reception on time. I had no clue what I was doing when I reached out to Paula, but she was so patient and informative as I figured out my needs and logistics‚Ä¶.Overall it was a fantastic experience working with Silver Star and I‚Äôd happily recommend them to anyone who needs transport for their wedding or other big event.
