Our Coxes ledge trip was nothing short of amazing, once the sun came up double headers of jumbo seabass started to fly over the rail. Everyone on board easily caught limits. Jigs and bait both worked great. We also caught a good number of jumbo bonito, porgies and trigger fish.
Our future block island trips will go all the way to coxes weather permitting, because fishing is that good book online to experience this amazing fishing

What a trip we just had. Back at the dock early with full boat limit of yellow fin tuna. Anchor came tight around 1am and all hell broke loose at 2:30am. It didn't matter if you used bait, jig or poppers fish were going nuts and with a few fish pushing 100lb mark we made a quick work of a boat limit and headed home.

We just came back from our two day tilefish trip and fishing was phenomenal! Everyone on board had limits of golden and blueline tilefish. We also hit some deeper spots for some exotics which produced rose fish, white hake and jumbo barrel fish. More pictures from the trip on our facebook page
