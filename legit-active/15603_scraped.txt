The only drawback was that there were no open blackjack tables. And the ones with the $15 & $25 minimum bets were full with a ring of people waiting to sit down.
They had some great entertainment as well with a group doing great covers of 80’s songs.
They actually had a couple beers available that weren’t Molson.

First thing is the exterior look is really very appealing and the interior 5 floors and a separate Quebec pavillion is amzing and can get a bit overwhelming by design which is good. For slot enthousiasts not even close beats all of the many casinos I have visited in Canada And northern USA. They have almost every machine from Low Volatility to very High volatility machines. You will find huge selection of Classic Old school slots to the newest slots from multiple gaming vendors certainly something for all tastes (makes findingan available meachine you like easy) Multi denom serves both low and high roll budgets very pleased with this. One thing you will love is you dont have to wait for low handpays is a thing of the past as machines are sett to what I believe is 10k$ where machines will print ticket. My personal opinion the Ainsworth selection is very very weak there and not talking about Must Hit by machines. I only saw one multi play Mustang 2 , eagle Bucks , Thunder cash etc.. machine.
Staff wise I would say is ok very friendly with plenty of smiles. Good bars great eating options and weekend evenings are pretty entertaining with dancing solid music and live bands on floor. Younger players seeking some fun can enjoy the Quebec Pavillions unique perspective as well as what appears to be a new and amazing arcade there. Out of town visitors sadly no onsite hotel nor resort style when in Montreal a well worth visit.
For table games Very very nice from full live dealers to live wheel eelectronic betting roulette something for again everyone. Personally I cant evaluate experience but dealers seem to be friendly.Read moreCasino MHello 773georgesc, We thank you for your great review, we are happy that you thought of us for your entertainment, hoping to see you again soon, we wish you a very nice day.Read moreWritten November 8, 2024This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited November 2024Traveled with familyWritten November 6, 2024Travel25346533585940 contributions3 of 5 bubblesA decent, non Las Vegas attempt at a Casino.

I had no hope of finding her, but Joshua, the security guard, very calm, smiling and professional, convinced me to wait.
The head of security, Victor (?), arrives after 30 minutes with my jacket!!! With the cameras, we've been able to identify the lady who claims to have the "wrong" jacket. I was not allowed to know who she was to avoid it next time, because she returned the jacket unchallenged. From now on, she'll be listed to watch. Good hearing, hi, ma'am.
A few years ago, I couldn't remember where I parked my car; security immediately found the place. That's it!
It's the only place I dare dance alone.
