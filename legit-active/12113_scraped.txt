Submit your own tip.Yard Art of Glenn Stark Art has been moved. Can't find it. Sad. [Joseph Matthews, 03/14/2022]The statues have been moved into storage to make way for construction. Because of decay, the city doesn't plan to put them back out again.
Yard Art of Glenn Stark The art is being moved to make room for a water park. A local told us it would be relocated to the city park. When we went to investigate, we found one of his pieces in front of a closed antique store. Perhaps the rest is being repaired or restored before being placed in the park. [Judy Ramsey, 07/26/2021]
Yard Artist Glenn Stark Stopped by to look at the art in the yard of wood carving artist Glenn Stark, and before we knew it Mrs. Stark came out and gave us a tour of the carvings and told us the story of most of them. We were then invited in to meet the artist himself and see many more wonderful artwork.
Wonderful people and a fascinating collection of his life's work. Stop if you can, it was an experience for sure, and I think we made his day just by stopping by!
[Clark Haas, 10/18/2010]
Yard Artist Glenn Stark Glenn Stark, now in his 90s, created a humorous assemblage of wood carved and concrete-sculpted figures all over his yard. The statues are mostly painted, and of varying sizes and subjects -- fish dangle from a tree, there's a Gryphon, a woman on horseback (Calamity Jane), an angel playing a harp, a dinosaur, Indians, totem poles, and more. A "Hagar the Horrible" concrete Viking holds the Stark mailbox.
Glenn has plenty of his creations indoors, so call ahead for an appointment and he may show you his stuff.
