Three great cultural organizations make their home here. Place-des-Arts is a beautiful art venue nested in the middle of Montreal and a great spot to hang out as there is always something to see, do, or hear in there. It is the largest cultural and artistic complex in Canada.Place-des-Arts is Montreal's central entertainment complex.

We first ate at Eggspectation and then continued our walk noticing what a change a few hours produced: from being rather quiet at 10am to being very lively at mid day.  I would expect in the evening to be poor madness.Lots of shops, restaurants, coffee places etc - a typical touristic area.Read moreWritten October 27, 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
