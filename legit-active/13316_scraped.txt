Lyrics:
C
Fuck the hippies in the haight
G
and fuck the punks and fuck their skates
D
fuck the hipsters when their glasses clack
C
together as they mate
G
fuck the food and fuck the foodies
C                    G
fuck the pizza (so it's called)
C                   D
fuck the culture, fuck the men who shave
C              G
their heads cause they've gone bald
CHORUS
C
fuuuck san francisco
G
from the clouds down to the ground
C
fuck every single detail of this
D
godforsaken town
C                              G
and if the city by the bay should somehow slip into the sea
D                            C?
don't think anyone will give less of a
G
shit than me
VERSE
fuck the hills and fuck the views
fuck the com for ta ble shoes
you need to walk here; fuck the
muni, and fuck the buses too
fuck city lights, fuck the wharf
Ah, the mission, it's alright
fuck lombard street, fuck the golden gate and
fuck it all at night
CHORUS
fuuuck san francisco
from the clouds down to the ground
fuck every single detail of this
god forsaken town
and if the city by the bay should somehow slip into the sea
don't think anyone will give less of a
shit than me
VERSE
fuck the parking, fuck the cars
fuck the microbrews in bars
fuck metallica and the dwarf that
plays the drums, yeah, fuck you lars
fuck the weather, fuck the fog
fuck the yuppies and their dogs
fuck the internet-bred whiners as they scribble in their blogs
CHORUS
fuuuck san francisco
from the clouds down to the ground
fuck every single detail of this
god forsaken town
and if the city by the bay should somehow slip into the sea
don't think anyone will give less of a
shit than me
don't think anyone will give less of a
shit than me
