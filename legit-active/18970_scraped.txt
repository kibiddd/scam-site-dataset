Dwight Yorke
Dwight Eversley Yorke CM (born 3 November 1971) is a Tobagonian former football player. He played for Aston Villa, Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham City, Sydney FC and Sunderland. He was the assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team until the completion of the qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Along with Russell Latapy and Pat Jennings, Yorke holds the record number of participations in different World Cup competitions, including qualifying stages ‚Äì six in total (1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010). Yorke was nicknamed The Smiling Assassin because of his goal scoring abilities and his constant smile.
Club career
Aston Villa
Yorke was first discovered by Graham Taylor, at the time the Aston Villa manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke appeared in a team that played a friendly match against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and he made his First Division debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1‚Äì0. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the 1995‚Äì96 season, he then switched to centre forward and quickly established himself as one of the Premier League's top strikers.

How GOOD were Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke?
Chemistry.
The main reason why you can't throw together a group of star players and expect them to perform wonders on the field.  If the chemistry isn't there, chances are that the results won't follow.
If you saw these two play together, you know exactly what I mean when I say that they're relationship was as close to telepathy as us mere humans can ever hope to achieve.
In their prime, they linked together to form one of the most potent strike partnerships that Europe has ever seen
Which brings us to the question of the day; how good were Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke?

Chemistry.
The main reason why you can't throw together a group of star players and expect them to perform wonders on the field.  If the chemistry isn't there, chances are that the results won't follow.
If you saw these two play together, you know exactly what I mean when I say that they're relationship was as close to telepathy as us mere humans can ever hope to achieve.
In their prime, they linked together to form one of the most potent strike partnerships that Europe has ever seen
Which brings us to the question of the day; how good were Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke?

Dwight Yorke
Dwight Eversley Yorke CM (born 3 November 1971) is a Tobagonian former football player. He played for Aston Villa, Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham City, Sydney FC and Sunderland. He was the assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team until the completion of the qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Along with Russell Latapy and Pat Jennings, Yorke holds the record number of participations in different World Cup competitions, including qualifying stages ‚Äì six in total (1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010). Yorke was nicknamed The Smiling Assassin because of his goal scoring abilities and his constant smile.
Club career
Aston Villa
Yorke was first discovered by Graham Taylor, at the time the Aston Villa manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke appeared in a team that played a friendly match against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and he made his First Division debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1‚Äì0. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the 1995‚Äì96 season, he then switched to centre forward and quickly established himself as one of the Premier League's top strikers.
