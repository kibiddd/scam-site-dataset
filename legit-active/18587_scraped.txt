About Us
SERvice TO MAnkind. The Sertoma Club of Venice was chartered in 1976 as part of Sertoma International, a leading non-profit civic service organization for more than eleven decades. Since 1912, professionals have banded together to provide help for their communities, to foster lasting friendships and to learn more about the needs of mankind. Sertoma Club of Venice's primary focus has been on providing exceptional care to children who are challenged with communication impairment through our non-profit center, the Sertoma Speech Clinic of Venice.
