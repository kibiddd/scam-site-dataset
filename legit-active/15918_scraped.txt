We obsess over our client experience—and it shows
Rated 5 out of 5 stars based on 430 customer reviews.
I was a first time buyer and new to the Columbus area and I had the privilege working with Natasha from New Albany Realty.  Luckily I ran into her during an open house I attended and glad I did.  Natasha went above and beyond helping me throughout the process from start to end, making my first time buying experience a pleasant one.  She was able to accommodate last minute showings, provided honest opinions, and provided me with trustworthy industry professionals.  I will definitely reach out to New Albany Realty and Natasha for future needs.read moreread less

We had a great experience working with New Albany Realty!  Our agent Kandis, was awesome to work with throughout the whole process.  Even with our first offer falling through, Kandis quickly negotiated with a previous interested party to secure a sale so we didn't miss any days on market.  She was always available (day and night) to answer questions and advocate for us.  We also want to give a big thanks to Heather Graham and Drew Lehman on the team.  Both were great to work with, professional, kind and helpful.  We enjoyed working with the entire team.  They all made the dreaded home selling process a very pleasant experience.  We can't say enough good things about them and would definitely recommend you working with this agent and her team!  Russ & Angelaread moreread less

We have had the pleasure of knowing Rob for many years and entrusted him in both the purchase and sell of our home. To say that we are pleased would be an understatement. Rob and his team were wonderful to work with and would highly recommend them for any of your real estate needs.read moreread less

We had the pleasure of being represented by Kandis Hall in both buying and selling. She demonstrated expansive market knowledge, had tremendous communication and was supportive all the way through the process. She also negotiated the sale price of our house well over asking in just days of listing. We cannot recommend her enough.read moreread less

We are so grateful to Kauser for finding us a beautiful home! We had been in the market for two years and it was just getting harder to find what we wanted. But Thankfully we found Kauser!!! She was amazing, knowledgeable, on top of her game and always available to accommodate us. We highly recommend her. We not only found a new home but a great friend. We are so grateful❤️❤️read moreread less

Summiyah, thank you so much for your kind words! It means a lot to us that you not only found a beautiful new home, but also built a wonderful friendship along the way. We truly appreciate your recommendation and look forward to being here for any future real estate needs!

I am very happy that we chose Heather Graham from New Albany Realty as our realtor. From the start I knew we made a good choice as she was very responsive and flexible and took a lot of time to listen to what we wanted from a home and helped us find the perfect place. Heather provides a personal touch and connection that you won’t get with just any realtor. Thank you Heather for finding our new home!read moreread less

We cannot say enough positive things about Kandis Hall when it comes to both selling and buying a home. We have lived in New Albany for about five years and got Kandis' name through friends, and we are so glad we did. Not only was Kandis able to find us our dream home off market but she was so easy to work with when we sold our home. We have two young children so thinking about the selling and open houses made us anxious but Kandis put our minds at ease. She made the process seamless from start to finish. Kandis truly goes above and beyond for her client's in every way. Kandis worked through every step of the selling process with us and never missed a beat. It is hard to pinpoint a favorite thing about Kandis. She is knowledgeable, kind, hardworking, and responsive. If you are looking to buy or sell a home in New Albany or anywhere, you should make Kandis Hall your first call!read moreread less

Thank you, Claire! We’re grateful you chose to work with Kandis and our team, and we’re delighted to know you felt supported every step of the way. If you ever need anything in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Congratulations on your new home!
