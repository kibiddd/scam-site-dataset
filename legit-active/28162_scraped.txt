GYM Promotions trots out two of it‚Äôs prospects tonight at the Casino in the burgeoning hotspot of Canadian boxing, Montreal, as fellow undefeated aspirants Antonin Decarie and Olivier Lontchi take center stage.
Welterweight Decarie, 17-0 (5), has the higher profile assignment as the 25 year old from Laval meets seasoned Mexican campaigner Israel Cardona, 36-8 (28), over ten scheduled rounds.
Cardona‚Äôs glory days are well behind him but the 33 year old Hartford, CT man did hold IBO belts at super feather and light welter as well as USBA/NABF lightweight trophies leading up to his failed bid to unseat IBF Lightweight Champion Paul Spadafora in 1999.
Since returning from a near four year layoff in 2006, Cardona has had mixed fortunes, winning two and losing as many in his four bouts. He should provide educating rounds for Decarie, who has outpointed a host of typical prospect building opposition since turning pro in three years ago.
Super bantamweight Lontchi, 14-0 (6), is coming off a solid points victory over ex-WBO Bantam boss Cruz Carbajal last November in which the local man picked up the WBO NABO/NABA belts.
Facing the former Canadian Featherweight supremo in a non-title eight rounder will be Mexico‚Äôs Henry Arjona, 17-9-1 (11), whose NABA Featherweight title bid last December was declared a no contest after Arjona was injured by an accidental headbutt in the fourth and unable to continue.
The highly skilled Lontchi needs to impress in this one if he is to get closer to his stated dream fight against fellow Canadian and current IBF Champion Steve Molitor.
