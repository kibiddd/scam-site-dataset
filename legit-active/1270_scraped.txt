USS Arneb (AKA-56), an early Moore Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.-built unit, photographed off Mare Island Naval
Shipyard, 13 February 1946. The first three Moore-built units were converted at Portland, OR., where they received pole radar masts forward of the stack supporting an
air search radar. Their surface search radar antenna was mounted on the fore topmast just above the lookout station. The stack on all the Moore-built ships appears to
be larger than on the ships built by Federal Ship Building Corp.
