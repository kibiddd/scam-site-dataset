Jake Beckley
(b. August 4, 1867 - d. June 25, 1918)
One of baseball's earliest stars, Jake Beckley played more games
at first base than any man in history. He had 2,931 hits, 1,600
runs scored, and 1.575 RBI. His dashing handle-bar mustache made
him a fan favorite. "St. Jacob's" 243 career triples are fourth
on the all-time list.

Comments: In September,
2002 I picked up my first Beckley, a PSA 3 (MK) T206 with an eBay
win. I upgraded to a PSA 4 in January, 2003 and then a PSA 5 a couple
weeks later with another eBay win. In August, 2004 I upgraded yet
again to a PSA 6. Then, an opportunity came up to obtain a T206
"Back" that I didn't have represented in the collection. I purchased
this T206 Broadleaf card off the Net54 B/S/T website in April, 2006
from Tom Botticelli. I have not seen another example surface since.

Description:
The nearly 525 cards which make up the T206 set are
the most popular of the early tobacco issues. Players are depicted
in color lithographs surrounded by a white border. The player's
last name on the -7/16" X 2-5/8" cards appears at the bottom with
the city and league, when a city had more than one team. Backs contain
an ad for one of 16 brands of cigarettes. There are 389 major leaguer
cards and 134 minor leaguer cards in the set, but with front/back
varieties the number of potentially different cards runs into the
thousands. The set features many expensive cards including a number
of pose and/or team variations.
