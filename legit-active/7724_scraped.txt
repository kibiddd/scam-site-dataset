Warlord: A Life of Winston Churchill At War
Warlord: A Life of Winston Churchill at War
Presented By
Carlo D’Este
Eminent  military historian Carlo D’Este speaks about his new book, Warlord: A Life of Winston Churchill at War, 1874-1945, on Thursday,  November 20, at 6:30 p.m. at the Central Library, 14 W. 10th  St.
D’Este’s  new biography of Churchill is the first study of the great twentieth century  leader to examine his life and accomplishments through a military lens. While  countless books have been written about Churchill the politician and world  leader, D’Este – author of the acclaimed biographies Patton: A Genius For  War and Eisenhower: A Soldier’s Life – argues that Churchill saw himself first  and foremost as a soldier, and that his lifelong obsession with military  history and tactics not only shaped the man and leader he became, but would  play a major role in the Allied victory in World War II.
While  his pivotal role as a wartime leader is at the center of this new biography,  D’Este also breathes new life into Winston Churchill the man. “In no particular  order, Churchill was brilliant, pampered, petulant, romantic, pragmatic,  courageous, egotistical, eccentric, possessed of enormous perseverance,  opinionated beyond measure, and impossibly demanding.” D’Este writes. “He drank  too much, suffered from depression (his ‘black dog’), ‘waddled rather than  walked,’ and by any criterion ought to have been too old to carry the  enormous burden of a prolonged war that threatened Britain’s existence.”
Warlord will be available for sale, and the author will sign copies purchased during  the event.
