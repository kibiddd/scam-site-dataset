Canadian War Memorial Green Park London England
Canadian army cadets place their hands on the edges of this sloping bronze memorial - water flows downwards across maple leaves embossed in the memorial.  In the summer the memorial is used by children as a water slide.  This is located in Green Park, just north of Buckingham Palace. Information related to the creation of this memorial can be found here:www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/stories/connolly_granche.html
