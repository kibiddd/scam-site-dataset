Acupuncture restores the regulatory movement of zheng (healthy) qi
Cass Hicks L.Ac. combines the practice of three styles of acupuncture. She has extensively studied five element acupuncture, Japanese acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Each patient is treated as an individual and is encouraged to participate in their own health and healing.
It is with a heavy heart that I have decided to close my San Francisco office due to Covid-19. I have loved practicing on Union Street for 21 years and am grateful to all of you who have trusted me in supporting your healing journey. Please contact me for any questions or concerns you may have in navigating your way forward regarding acupuncture.
Stay safe, Cass
