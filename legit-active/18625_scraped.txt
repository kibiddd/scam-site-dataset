The Rangers sent down two heroes of their 2023 World Series. Because 2025 is about meritocracy

Jacob deGrom is done after four innings and 70 pitches. He allowed three runs on four hits with two strikeouts and one walk. One of the hits was two-run homer by Salvador Perez. #Rangers have deGrom scheduled to pitch Sunday.

#Rangers' rotation order to start the season (all right-handers): Nathan Eovaldi, Jack Leiter, Tyler Mahle, Jacob deGrom. Kumar Rocker. An opener could be used Friday ahead of Leiter.

Dane Dunning was outrighted by #Rangers to Triple A Round Rock and is no longer on the 40-man roster. A player with at least four years' service time can refuse an assignment but would have to forfeit his salary. Dunning is making $2.66 million this season.
