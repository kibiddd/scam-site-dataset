About Thomas C. Starns, Sr.
Thomas' surname was also recorded as Starnes as was his fathers. His father was known as Thomas or Leonard. His mother came from Holland, her maiden name was Hart. (his son Thomas listed his mothers birthplace in the 1880 census as Ireland) It is believed that Thomas was descendent of Thomas Starnes of North Carolina, Virginia and Green County Tennessee era - 1734 - 1818 and immigrant ancestor Frederick Staring, era 1700-1774. Land, to the west, originally belonging to North Carolina and South Carolina became Tennessee and Georgia. These lands were in dispute up until 1790 thru 1818. Thomas lived in southeast Virginia until after the Revolutionary war, when the Starnes of southwest Virginia moved into North Carolina and Greene County Tennessee, Then on to Jackson Township, Fountain County Indiana. From there some of the family went into Kansas. The Staring brothers were among the Palatines who immigrated from Wonsheim, Alzey, Germany under subscription of Queen Ann of England.
Thomas and his wife are buried in Zackmire Cemetery near Wallace Indiana.
The Starns family is also related to the (Mueller) Miller side of our family through Thomas Sr's, wife Maria Elizabetha Brunner and her ancestors.
Note of interest: In the 1880 Census record, the enumerator lists his son Thomas' fathers birthplace as South Carolina and mothers as Ireland.

My great great great grandfather Thomas Starns SR
Added by HaroldMiller77 on 10 May 2008
Thomas was born October 12th 1781. At the time of his birth he was in South Carolina, which location is now in Tennessee. His grandfather Frederick I Staring was born in the village of Alzey, Germany located on the banks of the River Seltz, a tributary of the Rhine.  From early records found after WWII it appears the family descended from Frederick and Barbara Staring of Wonsheim.  The Starings were basicly fruit growers. After a hard freeze in the early 1700's Frederick, undersubscription of Queen Ann of England who desired to establish English settlements, along with his brothers were a part of the Palentine Immigrants, took up the invitation to settle  in the New Carolinas.  Thomas SR lived with his wife in Southeast Virginia until after the Revolution, when they moved.  He shows up in North Carolina before being listed on the Tax list of 1811 for Greene County, Tennessee.
After the war in 1785 North Carolina granted General Nathanael Greene (a Rhode Islander who was credited with outstanding military ability in his victory over the British) a 25,000 acre land grant which encompassed a part of Greene County . Thomas Starns SR married Mary Ann Elizabeth (they called  Betsy) Brunner, also spelled Bruner.  Betsy was from Maryland, her father Jacob Brunner was a Revolutainary Soldier.  His mothers name was Mary Cline who migrated from Germany. After their marriage they lived in Georgia and later to Indiana where they and several of their children are buried in Zackmire Cemetary near Wallace, Indiana. They had 12 children, the first 11 born in Tennessee. After Thomas SR died Elizabeth, his wife, lived with her son John Starnes.  The 1840 census record shows her as head of household living next door to her son John. They lived in Jackson Township, Fountain County, Indiana. The 1850 census shows her living with her son John. The 1860 census also shows her living with John Starns family as does the 1870 census.  All record her birth place as Maryland.
The family tree prepared by Maurice Woehrie of Plano, Texas "Ancestors of Maria Elisabeth Bruner" has conflicting birth and death information.
