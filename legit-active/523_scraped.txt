USS WYANDOT (AKA-92)
Wyandot (AKA-92) was laid down on 6 May 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1192) at Oakland
Calif.
by the Moore Dry Dock Co.; launched on 28 June 1944; acquired by the Navy and simultaneously commissioned on 30 September 1944 Comdr. E. G. Howard in command.
Following her shakedown
Wyandot departed San Francisco on 25 November 1944
bound for the Hawaiian Islands. She made port at Pearl Harbor on 2 December and
after loading cargo earmarked for the Marshalls and Marianas
headed for Eniwetok and Guam. After delivering her cargo to those western Pacific bases
the attack cargo ship returned to the Hawaiian Islands.
Wyandot departed Pearl Harbor on 26 January 1945 and proceeded thence via Eniwetok to Tacloban where she joined the forces massing for the assault on Okinawa. Assigned to a support role with the amphibious forces
Wyandot (partially unloaded) was returning from a night retirement alert about 0400 on 29 March when a Japanese horizontal bomber
probably on a night heckler mission
came in off Wyandot's starboard quarter and dropped a pair of bombs
one of which hit close aboard the ship's starboard quarter
sprinkling her stern with what appeared to be picric acid.
The second bomb plunged into the water near the attack cargo ship's starboard side and scored an underwater hit
making two large cracks in her hull. The two forward holds and the forward magazine flooded quickly
and Wyandot listed slightly to starboard. Putting the remainder of her landing craft and boats in the water
the vessel painfully made her way to an advanced repair base
down by the bow and steaming slowly
but still afloat.
Within a short time
the ship's force
aided by the salvage experts of the repair unit
had made the necessary temporary repairs; Wyandot consequently returned to her place off the beaches of Okinawa and continued discharging ammunition
vehicles
gasoline provisions
and special equipment earmarked for the American 10th Army on Okinawa.
Wyandot
her mission at Okinawa completed
sailed for the west coast of the United States
via Pearl Harbor
for permanent repairs and reached the Naval Dry Docks at Terminal Island
San Pedro
Calif.
on 6 June. After brief periods at San Diego
and later San Francisco
Wyandot headed for Pearl Harbor once more; but too late to participate in any further combat operations. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 28 August.
Wyandot subsequently visited the Far East that autumn
departing Pearl Harbor on 7 October and visiting
in succession
Okinawa; Tientsin
China; Guam; Eniwetok; and Kwajalein before returning to Pearl Harbor on 27 November. The next day
the cargo ship got underway for the Atlantic
steamed via the Panama Canal; and arrived at Norfolk
Va.
on 19 December.
Wyandot operated out of Norfolk for the next two years. Early in 1947
she departed the Hampton Roads area and took part in the 1947 Atlantic Fleet exercises; maneuvers that took the ship as far as Trinidad in the British West Indies. Departing Trinidad on 8 March
the attack cargo ship took part in further exercises before she made a transatlantic passage to Casablanca
French Morocco. Staying at Casablanca from 24 to 30 March
Wyandot returned via New Orleans to Norfolk on 30 April.
Again operating off the eastern seaboard early that summer
Wyandot subsequently headed for her first deployment in Arctic waters
departing Boston on 16 July 1947 for Thule
Greenland
and the Devon and Cornwallis Islands. Returning to Boston on 25 September
Wyandot spent the next year operating along the eastern seaboard and gulf coast of the United States
as well as making two cruises to the Caribbean and one to Panama.
On 16 July 1948
Wyandot departed Boston
visiting the Arctic again as part of the Navy's annual coldweather exercises in those climes. She revisited the bases she had called upon the previous year and returned to Boston on 18 September
en route to Norfolk.
Over the next two years
Wyandot operated out of Norfolk and made her first Mediterranean deployment
visiting ports in Italy and French Morocco; the island of Crete; Great Britain
Cuba; Puerto Rico
the Virgin Islands; Haiti; Newfoundland; Bermuda; Nova Scotia; the Panama Canal Zone; and Curacso
Netherlands West Indies.
Early in 1951
Wyandot was selected to participate in Operation "Bluejay" (transporting construction materials to the northern part of Greenland) and was busy in that mission from May to September of that year. She returned to that area in 1952 as part of Operation "SuNAC" (Supply Northern Atlantic Construction). The following year
Wyandot conducted logistical support missions in the Caribbean and later participated in the joint United States and Canadian resupply operations with Arctic weather stations. Wyandot again deployed to the Mediterranean and Caribbean areas between 1953 and 1955
winning the coveted Battle Efficiency Award for 1955
In the spring of 1955
Wyandot joined Task Force 43 for Operation "Deepfreeze I" in the Antarctic. After a brief yard availability
the ship loaded supplies and equipment at Davisville
R.I.
and shifted to Norfolk
from whence she departed on 14 November. Sailing via the Panama Canal and Port Lyttleton
New Zealand
Wyandot arrived at McMurdo Sound
Antarctica
on 27 December. While in those cold southern latitudes
she served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd
officer-in-charge of the Antarctic programs.
After establishing the base at "Little America
" Wyandot returned home and operated with the Atlantic Fleet into the late 1950's. Decommissioned on 10 July 1959 and struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1960 the ship was reinstated on the list because of the increased east-west tension over the crisis situation in Berlin.
Recommissioned in November 1961
Wyandot was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) in March 1963 and reclassified as TAKA-92. Later reclassified as T-AK-283
Wyandot served with MSTS
Atlantic
through the 1960's and was shifted to MSTS' successor organization
the Military Sealift Command (MSC) by October 1973
and to MSC
Pacific
by 1 July 1974. On 31 October 1975
Wyandot was placed in the Maritime Administration Reserve Fleet.
Wyandot (AKA-92) was awarded one battle star for her World War II service.
