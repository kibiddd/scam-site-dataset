Froch wants to end the fight before the scores reach the judges. Ward, with a near 50% knockout ratio, is not the puncher in the contest, but he is the better boxer and the better mover. Froch anticipates Ward's defensive manuevers to avoid a physical fight. The Nottingham boxer is going to cut the distance to prevent Ward from staying outside of the danger zone. Whether it's a straight knockout or the referee stepping in, Froch wants to end the contest with a taste of explosive drama."I'm going to stop him. Whether it's by knockout or by the referee jumping in and he's hanging on and I'm whackin' him around while he's backing around the ring. Pushing him off me and putting him in some serious trouble. Whether it's that sort of stoppage or a regular knockout, that's how I see the fight going. I'm the puncher of the two. I can bang with both hands. If I catch him with big shots, it's gonna put him in trouble," Froch told Scoop Malinowski of boxinginsider.com. "I think he'll do what he needs to survive and get through the fight. If that means he has to stay out of the way, jab and move, and not get involved, that's what he'll do. But it's my job to close the ring down, cut the corner off, get in front of him and do that and do it well. And use my strength and power which I know I can use. He might try to smother me and stay in close quarters and try to rough me up staying on my chest." 0 commentsTagsCarl FrochAndre WardWard-FrochWard vs FrochWorld NewsCommentsBe the first to comment.Add CommentAll Boxing ArticlesRead the latest top stories and boxing newsLoading...Sitemap
