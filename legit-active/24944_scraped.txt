Listen while you read!
I make an impact on lives
Through truth as well as lies
I overcome your eyes and
Leave an etched memory forever
It's my gift, my intentions are
Only well, its my gift
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
I lead people everyday
Always in the correct way
Never lead astray, and
Leave an etched memory forever
It's my gift, my intentions are
Only well, its my gift
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind is hard to find
An open mind
I make an impact on lives
Through truth as well as lies
I overcome your eyes and
Leave an etched memory forever
It's my gift, my intentions are
Only well, its my gift
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
