But buried beneath the decade’s strikes and power cuts are stunning cinematic gems, says John PattersonJohn PattersonFri 16 May 2008 16.40 BSTShareNo one who lived through the 1970s in Britain is ever likely to forget the experience or wish to revisit it. The three-day week, endless strikes, power cuts, the two narrow Labour election victories of 1974, the IRA's mainland bombing campaign, political stasis and deadlock under Heath-Wilson-Callaghan: the decade saw the excruciating demise of one political dispensation, and the violent birth-pangs of another.British cinema of the 1970s, by contrast, is almost impossible to remember. While Hollywood enjoyed its 70s renaissance, while new German cinema flourished and the Italian and French cinemas continued to produce groundbreaking work, British cinema, so vibrant throughout the 1960s, seemed to keel over and die. It didn't - not quite - but it takes some dedicated cinematic archeology to disinter several gleaming threads of endeavour that suggest British cinema didn't die after all, but went into a form of internal exile.There were other kinds of exile, too. When the American studio money that had largely underwritten the "British" new wave throughout the 1960s dried up in 1970, British cinema experienced a body-blow from which it took almost a decade to recover. Those intervening years seem like a wasteland of Confessions and Steptoe and Son movies, the last gasp of Hammer horror and the Carry On series. A few isolated landmarks stand out, often of debatable Britishness: Get Carter, The Wicker Man, A Clockwork Orange, O Lucky Man, Barry Lyndon, Scum, Quadrophenia, Rude Boy, two marvellous, unsettling films from the Polish exile Jerzy Skolimowski (Deep End, The Shout), the excesses of Ken Russell and the innovations of Nicolas Roeg.The 1970s saw most British film-makers either fleeing British shores for Hollywood or fleeing cinema for television, particularly at the BBC plays department, properly dubbed by critic David Thomson, now of this paper, as "the last studio". The BBC was a refuge: the budgets weren't huge, but radicalism was permissible and an attentive national audience with only three channels to watch was there for the taking. Advertising, meanwhile, was still incubating the major British film-makers of the 1980s - the Scott brothers, Adrian Lyne and Alan Parker - whose early films were merely stepping-stones to Hollywood. Other better established talents - Mike Hodges, John Boorman, John Schlesinger, Karel Reisz - decamped for Hollywood (or in the case of twice-exiled Joseph Losey, for France) or worked as directors for hire on American-backed films at cash-strapped facilities such as Pinewood and Elstree.So what remained, exactly, for those young directors yet to get established, those left out in the cold or those who were just too political? Theirs was a hardscrabble life of cadging funds from myriad sources, often in minuscule increments to permit another day or two of filming; of feature-length movies - some of them near-masterpieces - made for risibly low sums (as low as £3,000); of taking years to complete movies only to see them fumbled by distributors; of backing one's own movies; or seeking funds from the highly politicised BFI production board (formerly and more accurately called the Experimental Film Fund) or the National Film Finance Committee, both at different times bossed by Mamoun Hassan, whose beneficent influence on British alternative cinemas cannot be overstated.The BFI was behind early movies by Bill Douglas, Terence Davies and Barney Platts-Mills that are some of the most notable achievements of the period. Douglas's harsh, unflinching autobiographical trilogy - My Childhood (1971), My Ain Folk (1973) and My Way Home (1978) - shot in his coalmining hometown of Newcraighall, has been acclaimed, rightly, as the greatest film-making achievement to come from Scotland. With an austere look derived from Russian, Scandinavian and Italian neorealist film, it also disavows British feature film-making strategies and links itself more closely to the poetic strain of the British documentary movement. Its forthcoming release on DVD is long overdue and a moment to celebrate this great director, who made only one more film, Comrades (1987), and whose early death is one of the great tragedies of recent British film.Platts-Mills also managed to make only three movies in the 1970s, also against enormous odds. His debut, Bronco Bullfrog, made with a cast of East End teenage amateurs, edges in on Loach territory, but with a far rougher, rawer, funnier edge. Private Road (1971), starring Bruce Robinson and Susan Penhaligon as a writer and his lover tormented by class differences, received creditable notices despite rotten distribution, while The Hero (1982), a Scottish period drama with dialogue in ancient Gaelic, belongs with the Douglas films and Bill Bryden's Ill Fares The Land (1982) as a keynote Scottish movie.It is hard to know how a director as tender and emotionally raw as Terence Davies could have got his start without the BFI. For many viewers, the Terence Davies Trilogy (comprising the shorts Children, Madonna and Child, and Death and Transfiguration), with its long shots of people sobbing, its openness about homosexuality and loneliness, its naked grief and pessimism ("It makes Ingmar Bergman look like Jerry Lewis," noted the New York Times' Vincent Canby) is extremely forbidding and hard to watch, and hence just the kind of material a government arts body should be subsidising. Unlike Platts-Mills and Douglas, however, Davies did keep working, but the fact that in the next 20 years he made only four more movies surely constitutes an indictment of British cinema today.Elsewhere, British cinema of the 1970s resembles a tiny archipelago of cinematic islands, each with its own creative and political microclimate. Perhaps the most heroic endeavour in this area was Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's Winstanley (1975). Having spent their late teens and 20s - from 1956 to 1964 - slaving and cost-cutting to assemble It Happened Here, their dystopian speculative account of a Nazi-occupied England in the second world war, they then spent another eight years making this account of the Levellers' encampment on St George's Hill, Weybridge, in the aftermath of the English civil war. Fanatics for period detail, and deeply versed in every aspect of silent, European and Hollywood film-making, the two directors corralled accurate military uniforms and period costumes, 17th-century religious rhetoric, and even obsolete breeds of farm animal, to provide the backdrop to the film's radical politics. Given the power and assurance of these two movies, the fact that Mollo and Brownlow have never completed a further feature is another huge loss to British cinema.Elsewhere we find such homeless oddities as Peter Hall's Akenfield (1974) and Stuart Cooper's Overlord (1975). Akenfield, derived from Ronald Blythe's 1969 bestseller about a Suffolk village in the 20th century, opened the London film festival in 1974 and was simultaneously transmitted on TV before an audience of 14 million viewers, before disappearing for 30 years (it was recently rereleased, and it's stunning). A far more obscure movie on related themes, David Gladwell's Requiem for a Village, seems to have disappeared altogether.Overlord was financed by the Imperial War Museum. Cooper, an American-born documentarian resident in England, spent, he says, about 3,000 hours assembling army cameramen's footage of the preparations of D-Day in 1944. He then recruited screenwriter Christopher Hudson to write, and Kubrick's cinematographer John Alcott, fresh from Barry Lyndon, to shoot original sequences about one soldier's training, to interweave with and link up the vintage documentary footage. The result, notwithstanding its unlikely backer, is a sombre and moving film about, in Cooper's words, "the bleakness of sacrifice". Its rerelease last year drew favourable comparisons with the greatest war movies.Let us conclude with Radio On, one of the few movies made in Britain in the 1970s that conveys a tactile sense of how Britain felt at the end of that miserable decade: coca-colonialised, depressive, burnt-out, broke. In many ways Chris Petit's debut, inspired - and backed - by Wim Wenders, is a one-stop detour by the new German cinema through Callaghan-era Britain. Its concerns with establishing a different, uniquely British kind of filmmaking dovetail with the (non-chauvinistic) cine-nationalism of the German innovators in the face of the Hollywood domination. It barely made a tremor back then; now it looks like a lost road-map of possibilities for British cinema, none of which were ever taken up.These, I believe, are among the truly great British films - the most truly British and most truly filmic - of their era. Slowly but surely they are rising once again to the surface, altering, correcting, our understanding of the topography of British cinema in an overly scorned era. It's so good to have them back.· Radio On is released on DVD on May 26. The Bill Douglas Trilogy is released on DVD on June 23. The Terence Davies Trilogy is released on DVD on July 21. Overlord is available now on DVD.· This article was amended on Saturday May 24 2008. Ronald Blythe's book Akenfield and its film adaptation, directed by Peter Hall, were set in a Suffolk, not Sussex, village as we said in the article above.
