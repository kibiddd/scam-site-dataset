Built for Chicago Tribune owner Robert R. McCormick and recently sold, it is home to luxury residences these days. The architecture is a truly remarkable example of the Gothic Revival style created by famous architect, Raymond Hood and his firm. The top of the tower is designed after the Tour de Beurre beurre of the Rouen Cathedral. Another notable feature of this spectacular skyscraper is its elaborate Neo-Gothic arched portal. Magnificent gem of Chicago and not to be missed.Read moreWritten October 12, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Besides a stunning architectural design, Tribune Tower has a collection of building fragments from around the world, embedded into the building's stone facade, which makes it unique and even more memorable. Tribune Tower faces  Pioneer Plaza, Chicago River, Michigan Avenue Bridge, Wrigley Building,  and it is an inseparable part of the history of Chicago. Since 2018 the building has been converted into luxury condominiums. The views of Tribune Tower are spectacular , whether you are on E Wacker Drive or Chicago Riverwalk, at the north border of the Loop area or close by at N Michigan Avenue. Tribune Tower building is beautiful, and it is undoubtedly an iconic historic site to visit. In 1989, Tribune Tower was designated Chicago Landmark.Read moreWritten August 22, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In recent years, however, the newspaper was sold and moved out of the building, which has been converted to condominiums. But one peculiar quirk remains untouched, making it perhaps the most amazing building in Chicago. Crammed and embedded into the base of its walls are bricks and pieces of stone from the most famous structures in the world, 149 fragments of famous world architecture, artifacts collected by Chicago Tribune correspondents in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Tribune Tower was being constructed. Walk around the building and you'll see fragments from the Taj Mahal, the Alamo, Great Wall of China, Westminster Abbey, the White House, Great Pyramid of Egypt, Berlin Wall, Omaha Beach, Remagen Bridge, Pearl Harbor, the Parthenon, Abraham Lincoln's tomb, the Colosseum in Rome, Notre Dame Cathedral, Fort Sumter, Vatican City, Arch de Triumphe, Corregidor, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Cumberland Gap, Andersonville prison, Little Bighorn, Antarctica, the Hagia Sophia, Pompeii, even a moon rock from the Apollo 15 mission in 1969 and a piece of twisted metal from the World Trade Center after its destruction in 2001.Read moreWritten August 21, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Completed in 1925, it sits at a prominent location near the corner of Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive where Michigan Ave crosses the Chicago River. The whole area makes for some great photos and can also be experienced by strolling on the Chicago Riverwalk. This was once home to the Chicago Tribune newspaper but has been converted into residences in the past 10 years. It is interestingly decorated on the exterior with rocks embedded into the walls from many famous landmarks of the world.Read moreWritten March 10, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Built between 1923-25, this is a 36 floor skyscraper with elaborate Neo-Gothic features from top to bottom. One of the most interesting aspects of the Tribute Tower are the embedded fragments from many historic and important landmark buildings and structures from around the world including the Parthenon (Greece), Great Pyramid (Egypt), Angkor Wat (Cambodia), Great Wall of China, Taj Mahal (India) and Westminster (England) amongst many others. This makes for a fun bit of sightseeing in addition to viewing the Neo-Gothic building characteristics.Read moreWritten May 25, 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Again, Chicago has amazing examples of every architecture, especially on the river and this combined with the Wrigley building are the city's best examples of neo-gothic.  Where the Tribute Tower really distinguishes itself with its slender verticality topped by the buttress tower.  It is a modern gothic temple to media and for nearly 100 years it has been the of an American publishing giant.  Of course today media has changed, certainly newspapers but the building is a testament to longevity of media in Chicago.Read moreWritten November 26, 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I walked around the building and took pictures of every rock or artifact that was embedded into the exterior walls, there were several   artifacts from places I've been to like the Rock from the Battle of Little Big Horn, or Scott Bluff just to name a few, but the real gem is the Big Map in the lobby. It appears to be three stories high. The Desk Staff are very professional but please obey the rules. This is a Residence Building so please respect their privacy. If you ask nice you may be allowed to take a picture of the Big Map. They just don't make buildings like this anymore.Read moreWritten July 20, 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
