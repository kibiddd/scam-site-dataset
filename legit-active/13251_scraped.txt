It's essential to apply through the official Government of Canada website (Canada.ca/eTA), and the cost is $7 Canadian. Applications should be made as early as possible since approval times can vary.Validity and LimitationsSome travelers mentioned that an eTA is valid for five years or until the passport expires, whichever comes first. It's important to note that while an eTA allows you to board a flight to Canada, it does not guarantee entry into the country, which is determined by Canadian Customs and Immigration at the point of entry.Special ConsiderationsTravelers have called out that those who have ever held Canadian citizenship should not apply for an eTA but must use a Canadian passport. Additionally, an eTA is not required for entry into Canada by land or sea, only by air.This summary was generated by AI from Tripadvisor forum posts. See related postsWas this helpful?What are the requirements for entering Canada?Entry Requirements OverviewAccording to forum posts, travelers entering Canada must be fully vaccinated and have completed the ArriveCAN app submission within 72 hours before arrival. Additionally, a valid passport is required for entry.Testing and QuarantineSome travelers noted that there are no pre-entry testing requirements for fully vaccinated individuals, but a random selection for a PCR test upon arrival is possible. Travelers should also have a quarantine plan ready, even if not required to use it, in case they are symptomatic or do not meet the fully vaccinated criteria upon arrival.Documentation for MinorsFor minors, especially when traveling by land, it has been mentioned that American children can enter Canada with just a birth certificate, without a passport. This information is confirmed on the U.S. State Department's website, but travelers are advised to verify on Canadian sites or directly with Canadian authorities.This summary was generated by AI from Tripadvisor forum posts.

This service allows travelers to experience multiple time zones and diverse landscapes.Alternative Train OptionsSome travelers have highlighted the Rocky Mountaineer as a luxury option, offering routes like First Passage to the West and Journey Through the Clouds between Vancouver and the Canadian Rockies. This service is known for its scenic views and high-end amenities but comes at a higher cost compared to VIA Rail.Travel ExperienceTravelers have called out that while VIA Rail offers a more budget-friendly option with sleeper and seating accommodations, it does not prioritize its trains on tracks, leading to potential delays. The Rocky Mountaineer is praised for its exclusive focus on daylight travel, ensuring passengers do not miss the scenic views.Booking and PlanningFor planning and booking, users have recommended resources like the VIA Rail website and the Man in Seat 61 website for detailed information on routes and accommodations.

Several travelers have shared their experiences of delays and additional documentation requests after disclosing past convictions. For example, one user noted a lengthy eTA processing time after declaring a DUI conviction from over 10 years ago, indicating that even older offenses could trigger a review process.Documentation and Review ProcessTravelers have called out that when applying for an eTA with a criminal record, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) often requires supplementary documentation, such as police certificates. Some users reported that after submitting the required documents, it took weeks or even months to receive eTA approval, suggesting a thorough review by Canadian immigration authorities.Advice for ApplicantsFor many users, the general advice is to apply for an eTA well in advance if they have a criminal record. This allows ample time for potential additional reviews or document requests. Additionally, being truthful and providing all requested documentation upfront can facilitate the process, as seen in cases where users eventually received their eTA after complying with all IRCC requirements.This summary was generated by AI from Tripadvisor forum posts.
