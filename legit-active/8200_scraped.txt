BiographyAwardsTriviaIMDbProAll topicsFred Kohler(1887-1938)ActorIMDbProStarmeterSee rankProlific "heavy" in American films of the silent and early talkie eras.
A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Kohler left home as a teenager,
working various jobs while trying to establish a career in vaudeville.
During this time, according to his son, actor Fred Kohler Jr., Kohler worked in
a mine and lost part of his right hand in a dynamite accident.
Eventually he fell in with a touring theatrical company and worked
onstage around the U.S. for several years. In his mid-twenties, he
ended up in California and found roles in silent films. He quickly
found a niche as a villain, by virtue of his imposing size and his
fearsome features, typically and most memorably in The Iron Horse (1924). He worked
primarily in Westerns, but films of all sorts benefited from his skill
at screen nastiness. In a series of silent Paramount Westerns based on
Zane Grey novels, Kohler not only played the heavy, but also repeated
some of those roles when these films were remade as talkies a decade
later. His career lasted without let-up until his sudden death due to a
heart attack at 51 in 1938.BornApril 20, 1887DiedOctober 28, 1938(51)BornApril 20, 1887DiedOctober 28, 1938(51)IMDbProStarmeterSee rankAdd to list
