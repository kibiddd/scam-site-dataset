NOTES FROM THE WEBMASTER
MARCH 2025Advisory per normal:I’m staying current by uploading one or a few reviews at a time,rather than the bulk uploads of yore, since the architecture ofAISLE SAY’s new design supports it. So please return periodically;there should be new reviews appearing somewhat regularly.You’ll know there’s new stuff when the featured picture to the right changes.Meanwhile—also again—if you’d care to check out my new book,which, happily, has received rave reviews from the pros and five stars from readers, it’sTHE NOVELIZERS:An Affectionate History of Media Adaptations and Originals,Their Astonishing Authors—and the Art of the CraftIts feature-packed website is thenovelizers.netAnd it’s for sale at Amazon at these links, incasebound color hardcover,grayscale trade paperbackand budget-priced color ebookMARCH 2025
