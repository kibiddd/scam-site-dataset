About RSS
RSS is an XML based document format for syndicating news and other timely news-like information. It provides headlines,
URLs to the source document and brief description information in an easy to understand and use format. RSS based
"News Readers" and "News Aggregators" allow the display of RSS headlines on workstation desktops.
Software libraries exist to read the RSS format and present RSS headlines on webpages and other online applications.
These NWS supplied RSS documents use the RSS 2.0 format. Each RSS item links to the html/web documents described above.
Additional technical information is available from the following non-US Government website:

Comments on this service are welcome.
About XML
NWS offers hourly weather observations formatted with xml tags to aid in the parsing of the information by automated
programs used to populate databases, display information on webpages or other similar applications. This format is not
to be confused with RSS and cannot be read by RSS readers and aggregators. These files present more detailed
information than the RSS feeds in strings friendly for parsing. Both the RSS and XML feeds offer URLs to icon images.
Additionally, a list of what phrases may appear in the <weather> XML tag and suggested
icons is available. To access these feeds, select a state and then the last XML link in the column.
