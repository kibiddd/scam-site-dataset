Mormonism in the 20th century
1910s in sociology
1910s
The 1910s (pronounced "nineteen-tens", also abbreviated as the "teens") was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 1910, and ended on December 31, 1919. The 1910s represented the culmination of European militarism which had its beginnings during the second half of the 19th century. The conservative lifestyles during the first half of the decade, as well as the legacy of military alliances, was forever changed by the assassination, on June 28, 1914, of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. The murder triggered a chain of events in which, within 33 days, World War I broke out in Europe on August 1, 1914. The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial, one-sided Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on June 28, 1919.
The war's end triggered the abdication of various monarchies and the collapse of five of the last modern empires of Russia, Germany, China, Ottoman Turkey and Austria-Hungary, with the latter splintered into  Austria, Hungary, southern Poland (who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Moldavia. However, each of these states (with the possible exception of Yugoslavia) had large German and Hungarian minorities, there creating some unexpected problems that would be brought to light in the next two decades.  (See Dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire: Successor States for better description of composition of names of successor countries/states following the splinter.)

The Cult of Mormonism
Thanks to Keeps for sponsoring this video! Head to https://keeps.com/Philion to get 50% off your first Keeps order.
Mormonism is a modern religion founded by American "Prophet" Joseph Smith in 1830 with the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ and publication of the infamous Book of Mormon. Now nearly 200 years old, it has spiraled into one of the fastest growing religions in the world. The actual history of Mormonism is one of absurdity, a completely fabricated story designed to fulfill Smith's agenda. Operating like a billion dollar corporation instead of a religion: this is the cult of mormonism.

Mormonism is a modern religion founded by American "Prophet" Joseph Smith in 1830 with the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ and publication of the infamous Book of Mormon. Now nearly 200 years old, it has spiraled into one of the fastest growing religions in the world. The actual history of Mormonism is one of absurdity, a completely fabricated story designed to fulfill Smith's agenda. Operating like a billion dollar corporation instead of a religion: this is the cult of mormonism.

Understanding the roots of the Latter-day Saints.
Joseph Smith grew from a treasure hunting farm kid in Upstate New York, to the prophet and founder of the LDS Church. This is a story of American expansion, persecution, and a gifted storyteller.

People from all over the world, and from all walks of life, are learning that the Book of Mormon can help us become better people and feel closer to God.

1910s
The 1910s (pronounced "nineteen-tens", also abbreviated as the "teens") was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 1910, and ended on December 31, 1919. The 1910s represented the culmination of European militarism which had its beginnings during the second half of the 19th century. The conservative lifestyles during the first half of the decade, as well as the legacy of military alliances, was forever changed by the assassination, on June 28, 1914, of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. The murder triggered a chain of events in which, within 33 days, World War I broke out in Europe on August 1, 1914. The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial, one-sided Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on June 28, 1919.
The war's end triggered the abdication of various monarchies and the collapse of five of the last modern empires of Russia, Germany, China, Ottoman Turkey and Austria-Hungary, with the latter splintered into  Austria, Hungary, southern Poland (who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Moldavia. However, each of these states (with the possible exception of Yugoslavia) had large German and Hungarian minorities, there creating some unexpected problems that would be brought to light in the next two decades.  (See Dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire: Successor States for better description of composition of names of successor countries/states following the splinter.)
