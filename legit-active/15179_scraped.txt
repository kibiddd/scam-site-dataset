VIDEO: Liverpool 2-3 United (FA Youth Cup Quarter-Finals)
March 13, 2011
Manchester United came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Anfield in the FA Youth Cup quarter-finals, in a game that saw two players from each side sent off. Larnell Cole scored United’s first from the penalty spot, after Paul Pogba was bizarrely shown a second yellow for dummying his penalty kick. Ravel Morisson went on to score two goals, the second of which five minutes before time, to see United through to the semis to face Chelsea.

Liverpool played kick and run football while we moved the ball around well. This was a strong factor in our superiority. The future is definitley uniteds after this showing.

Those players you mentioned I'd be surprised if 2 of them make it let alone 8. I would bet money with you but I don't want your kids to miss out on their rat stew.

Travesty of a sending off.  Proves refs can't count.  The Chelsea decisions were payback for Rooney's elbow, last week's Liverpool decisions were payback for SAF's 'strong, or fair, either would do' comments.  We're supposed to be even now.

I think 90% of the people here will dare to bet a few quids on all the names that guy mentioned, that they will probably be shipped out to a league 1 side soon. At least Arsenal's boys have the media talking about them, I seriously have never even heard of any of those that this guy mentioned.

Marq - The media talk about the Arsenal players because they are a bunch of fucking lick up cunts.  Our boys are quietly making a name for themselves and if it's only the likes of all associated with United acknowledging that, then that's all that matters.  I would cringe if the media were wanking over our players, putting needless pressure on them.  The future for Liverpool is fucking shit, even Alonso was laughing with Spanish teammates when he said that they had replaced him with Lucas.

Redmist you must be a biggest dumbo creature to be living in this earth.You say you were the best team but still you lost.
You say refs spoiled the game but we also lost two players.
You say your keeper did nothing except pick the ball out of the net 3 times but you still lost.
But what are you made off.Pigs shitt. Pathetic comment dude.
You are a disgrace to us by wearing red.Please go and wear some other color dress.

A scouse and intelligence in them same sentence talking about school? I haven't laughed so much in my life. The hypocrisy of these statements all because we knocked them out the cup after being 2-0 down., Yeah the Spice Boys were better than the Fledglings too which is why they went on to dominate English footba...Oh wait they din't. Now go back to fingering your nan and rimming your grandpa RedPissed off at everything that isn't inbred and scouse.

I'm not sure this proves anything. Neither side is doing that well in the youth league and Villa who are in the other semi are far stronger. 1 or 2 top players in both sides but no more than that.

Listen you clowns.. Liverpool have won the FA youth cup more than any other club and the last time we won it we produced one first team player who non of us think is really going to make it at the club big however he will be a premier league pro if not at Liverpool else wear - Jay Spearing.
Its not about winning the FA Youth cup its about producing talent for the first team. And we've got it coming through in bucket loads!
The only thing coming out of your youth team at the moment is bucket loads of Sh@#e!
This is easy! its like shelling peas...
Ash you won!!! WANKER!!! LOL

Just admit it, you got well beaten, despite the ref trying to help you. Let the future take care of itself. Right now I think I'd bet on United's youngsters making it in the next few seasons, but only time will tell.

Jay spearing is shit pal.  We aren't talking about players that will make it at any premier league club as we have dozens of them.   Shawcross jones bardsley spector richardson etc etc. We have players all over the premier league.  How many have you produced out there?   Fuck all. Out of the team that featured yesterday giggs svholes oshea wes da silvas gibbo all have been at united since their teens and most come through the youth system.   Tunnicliffe morrsion and possibly pogba all have a great chance of making it BIG at united.

RedMist - You're an ignorant cunt.  I think you'll find that we have won it more than any other club, including the monopoly of it in the 1950's.  Go and treat yourself to something from the dustbin you fucking bastard.

@Redmist
David Ngoo, would that be the same David Ngoo that United had on trial and choose not to persue further? Seriously if you are going to bang on about how great your youth side is perhaps you shouldn't include players that United had on trial and decided weren't good enough as you look foolish
And I seem to recall either at the end of last season or may have been in the summer someone at the club saying that the youth quality was lacking and there would be lucky to uncover one player who was a regular first team starter in the current youth setup. Will try and find the link to the quote later

Now i understand that not only you are the most bumbo creature on this planet but you are also having delutionary problem.
You say you have won the most fa youth cup go and check the sources you monkey ass its Manchester united with 9.
But you are bound to make mistakes as you thought as the team which was  wearing red won 9 trophies and it must be loserpool.
Again pathetic stuff dude.Try again.

Tremendous results (Senior and Youth) that further vindicate Sir Alex's siege.
