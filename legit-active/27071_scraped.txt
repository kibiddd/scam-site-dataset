"Chai" actually means "tea" in Hindi, so when people say "chai tea," they're essentially saying "tea tea." Traditional chai is a blend of black tea with a variety of spices, milk, and sweeteners. Take a LookSUPPORT EACH OTHERJUST MY CUPPA CHAIJUST MY CUPPA CHAIWe believe in supporting one another and are happy to stock plenty of handmade pottery mugs "made with love" by various artisans from Alberta, Manitoba and BC.Stop by our location in both Calgary Farmer's Markets in Calgary to see what's in stock.#supporteachotherIn-store OnlyMEET THE OWNERJUST MY CUPPA CHAIMEET THE OWNERWe really appreciate and send a sincere thank you to all our customers.

The Local Difference
We are a independent, local family-owned and operated loose-leaf tea business based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
We curate the finest teas and/or hand-blend with premium ingredients to bring you the best teas possible for over 22 years!
All the tea packaging, graphic design, labeling and so on, is done here by hand right in Calgary.
Family is, and always will be a huge part of our success -  my children have all worked along side me in the store and the warehouse.
Nieces, Nephews and Family friends are an important part of our workforce, we are proud to have been able to and still do, employ extended family!
We offer bulk discount pricing, just email us for larger quantities and it can be brought to our storefront for your pickup.
Do you have something you are looking for - talk to us about special orders brought in just for you or custom blends.  We'll find it, blend it or tweak it -- until it's just right.
