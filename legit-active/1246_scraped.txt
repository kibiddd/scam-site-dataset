While the atmosphere is generally calming, it can become lively, which may not suit those in search of peace. The service receives mixed reviews, with some guests noting occasional warmth but also instances of inattentiveness.
Cleanliness is a strong suit, despite occasional hiccups in amenities replenishment. However, the hotel's value is questioned by guests who feel the costs outweigh the benefits, especially with some room and amenity shortcomings.Jump to all reviewsAmenitiesSatisfactoryAtmosphereLivelyCleanlinessMixedLocationBeachfrontRoomsCleanServiceInconsistentValueExpensiveWas this helpful?Tripadvisor is not responsible for this summary or the opinions in it.
