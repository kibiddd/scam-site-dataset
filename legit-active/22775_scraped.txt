In the first segment of this series, Associate Head Coaches Chris Collins and Steve Wojciechowski break down the perimeter and big guys with individual skill work focusing on fundamentals and principles of Duke Basketball.Coach K takes the court and discusses early season goals and how his practice is designed.  Throughout the practice, Krzyzewski explains how he chooses drills and how they translate into accomplishing team goals. After the practice, the Associate Head Coaches hold a Q&A session. Listen in as they discuss their ball-screen defense, zone offense, scouting philosophy and more! Individual WorkoutsCoach Wojciechowski begins the workouts warming-up the post players with defensive fundamental drills. After the warm-ups they jump straight into physical drills to defend the post, counter baseline drives, and finishing off possessions with rebounding. On the offensive side of the ball they work on finishing at the rim, playing off penetration, and ball-screen situations that replicate game-situations. Coach Collins takes the perimeter players onto the court warming them up with ball-handling and fundamental passing drills. After the warm-up they work in the full-court on developing good ball pressure and ball-handling ability. On offense, they work on spacing, surveying the court, and attacking the basket. Within all of their drills they stay true to their principles and work on the situations that they will see in live situations.PracticeCoach K begins practice working on fundamentals requiring constant communication. See how they build from 3-on-0 and 5-on-0 weaves into both 2-on-1 and 3-on-2 situations. Watch the Blue Devils transition from 5-on-0 down the court and come back into their half-court offense against a set man-to-man defense.Moving on to the defensive side of the ball, they begin working on 5-on-4 close outs and also 5-on-5 "change." Coach K builds his defensive pressure by demonstrating his full-court and three-quarter court presses and traps ("41", "42", "32" and "31 White") to pick-up the tempo.Coach K then demonstrates the different offensive sets they use to overload the court against the 2-3, 3-2, and 1-2-2 zones. These sets provide reads for the players to have multiple options for lay-ups and wide-open three point shots.Q&A SessionCollins and Wojciechowski run the session to answer any question about Duke's philosophy and what was demonstrated in both the practice and workouts. They answer questions regarding their ball-screen defense and how they attack both middle-screen & rolls and side-screen & rolls. Collins details Duke's defensive numbering system including the presses and traps that were covered in the practice. Both Collins and Wojciechowski break down baseline and sideline out of bounds plays giving you thirteen quick hitters from special situations.Order today and watch as Duke Blue Devils prepare for the 2010-11 season looking to repeat as NCAA National Champions!419 Minutes (4 videos). 2011.All Access videos are designed to allow viewers from all over the world to see how successful coaches run their practices in a "live" practice setting. All Access videos allow viewers to see the practices un-edited and in real-time. You will see how top coaches run their drills, interact with their team and staff, how they motivate their team, the cue words they use, the atmosphere of the practice and how practices are structured from day to day. Many coaches visit successful colleges and high schools to watch practice. But if you live out of state or out of the country, visiting another coach's gym can be costly. That's why we created the All Access Practice Series of videos -- to bring the practices to you!

This is a great DVD. I've used several drills to implement my offense and defense. I've showed the DVD to our players so they could see how the drills are suppose to look. It really motivated them and we have great practices. It comes with a PDF practice plan that I use. I coach a boy's JV team.

I own all of the Duke All-Access DVD sets and each set is loaded with great information.  This set is no exception.  Coach K, Wojo, and Collins all provide excellent detailed information that can be used at any level.  There is so much information on these DVD's that I made a master index of all the topics covered and then use the index to find what I need, when I need it.
