"The toilet in the 1st hotel room didn't flush, so we had to move to another room.2022-08-25""Nice hotel, but I had to stand in line for over 20 minutes at check-in. 2022-08-14""Close to the stadium.

"The hotel was outdated and smelled bad. The front desk clerk left me on hold for almost 20 minutes when I called; I ended up hanging up and calling back. When I arrived, I had to wait 10 minutes to check in, and then the key card for the room wouldn't work. After 2 failed attempts, the clerk ended up having to come and let me in the room. On a positive note, the beds were comfortable.2022-01-04""Close to everything you'd need, and just 5 minutes from the stadium. The room was perfect; everything was clean. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't have any issues at all.2021-06-28""The hotel checks rooms at checkout, but I was upset that I was charged my $100 deposit when a small ink pen mark was found on a bedsheet.2020-07-07"     < Hide

"The hotel was convenient to St. Luke's Hospital. The room was clean, and the beds and furniture were nice. The employees were pleasant and helpful. Average breakfast bar. An OK place to stay.2022-05-11""Not a good value. Our floor and room had an awful smell, and housekeeping was poor. No microwave, and the bedding wasn't up to par. Breakfast was late and wasn't good at all. We had to park at the very back of the parking lot, and there was no lighting. Don't stay at this hotel if you want to be comfortable.2021-11-01""We went to our room and found it hadn't been cleaned. The hotel clerk apologized and gave us a new room, but it didn't have a whirlpool tub. She was helpful and printed out directions for us. Not a lot of parking in front of the building, so you may have to park in back, but there was security.2020-11-11"     < Hide

"Close to the hospital. The room was spacious and clean, and had a kitchenette. I felt safe. There was unfinished work in the bathroom, and the blinds needed repair.

"Not worth the price. The shower door leaked water all over the bathroom floor. We had to wipe it up with the towels, and when we asked for more towels, housekeeping said they didn't speak English. When I called the front desk, I was told that rooms were only serviced every other day. The hallway carpet was dirty. There was only 1 working elevator, and it wasn't readily available. Find a better hotel.2023-04-17""The hotel was close to the hospital, and the room was clean and quiet. Parking was convenient to the entrance.

"We were disappointed. While the staff was responsive, the hotel has deteriorated since our last stay. The carpets were worn and frayed, the furniture was stained, and there seemed to be a lack of upkeep. We requested housekeeping service, but what we got was just fresh towels and the folding back of the comforter. No other housekeeping was done. The restaurant was just a small grill. We won't stay here again.2022-05-19"     < Hide

"Ideal location for our business trip. The hotel room was quiet, even though it was across from the elevators. Check-in and checkout were quick and easy. The breakfast lady was the best. I recommend staying here.2022-11-17""The hotel room was clean.2020-03-02"     < Hide

"The beds were comfortable. The hotel charged a parking fee.2019-02-23""Good hotel for a good price.2018-11-29""The housekeeper didn't service our room the 2nd day. I was disappointed, but I felt safe and the front desk clerk was nice. The room had a microwave, fridge, coffee pot, and hair dryer. The TV was small, and there weren't many towels. I'd stay at this hotel again.2018-01-24"     < Hide

"Excellent service, and the staff provided a great restaurant recommendation. I highly recommend this hotel.2020-12-07""The circular drive in front got congested. Fast check-in and nice lobby. There was hair on the sofa in our suite, and the sink didn't drain well. The hallways needed vacuuming, and the table and decorations by the elevators were covered in dust and fingerprints. The elevators were speedy. Don't expect the hotel to be especially clean.2018-11-01"     < Hide

How Do We Order Hotels?
We order the hotels on this page by how close they are to this attraction.
Most of our competitors order these same hotels in other ways that make them more money.
How Do We Define Motel?
To us, motels are smaller lodgings that have rooms you can enter directly from the parking area.
At hotels, on the other hand, you can enter your room only through a hall inside the building.
Hotel Booking Tips
Beware of non-refundable reservations that could cost you a lot of money if you change or cancel them. +Non-refundable reservations are a gamble that will usually save you less than $10. If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -
Don't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot – because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -
Always read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -More >
When you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.
The earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.
