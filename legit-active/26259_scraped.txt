Ian Momoshiki said on 19/Jun/22Mohammed-170cm said on 24/Nov/21
He ain't taller than 175-175.5 cm
i think 5'9 1/8 is the range he would get constantly in measurements, which is 175,5. he look solid 1 inches taller than rob here, and rob is self proclaimed 173 cm
Ian Momo 'Questionable 5'10' said on 7/Feb/22strong 5'9, i would say 175,5-176 range or almost 5'9 1/4
Jackie Lee said on 6/Jan/22A solid 5ft 9 guy. Considering rob is 5ft 8.25 or 8.5, he can even look 5ft 9.25 or 9.5 if he stood better
Mohammed-170cm said on 24/Nov/21He ain't taller than 175-175.5 cm
Editor RobHe's shorter in person than someone like Andrew Lincoln, who of course is taller than him in film.
Lawrence099 said on 3/Dec/20Exactly 1 inch on rob 5â9 1/8 175.5 cm
Vincent Caleb said on 24/Oct/20He looks like a comfortable 5â9â.
Kebapsever said on 25/Jun/20He looks 5â9,5 (177cm) in the picture with you. If the foot wear is same I think he deserves a upgrade.
Andy5'91/2 said on 30/Apr/20watching doctor who i thought in the weak 5â10 range but hes hovering over an inch taller than rob maybe an inch exact but. I give him 5â9.5 he could be 5â9.25 but i feel 5â9.5 is Right i love that weâre the same height
JohnMoore-162cm said on 17/Mar/20a solid inch taller than Rob , I do believe Rob is more like 5'8 1/4" , we get 5ft9 1/4"
Nik said on 9/Feb/20His honesty is a credit to him!
Nik said on 5/Feb/20He can pull it off!
Chris Junior Hernandez 1990 said on 24/Jan/20I believe John wake up at 5'9 7/8 and settle down at 5'9 1/8 before bed.
Bobby 5'10 (178cm) said on 18/Mar/19If he levelled his head, his eye level should be 5'4. I'm guessing his level is closer to 5 inches?
Christian 6'5 3/8" said on 23/Feb/195'9" at the very least. Could be 5'9.25"
burnitdownhomies said on 12/Jan/19If he stood up straight he could look 5'10.
berta said on 29/Dec/18he look like a guy that is 5 foot 9 ore 1/8 over it
Bwk said on 28/Nov/18Finally an actor who's actually honest about their height.
MrFish said on 7/Oct/18Rob, what's the absolute shortest you would guess Simm at? Thanks.
Editor RobComfortably taller than 5ft 8.5 men, but shorter than 9.5 men. Whether a little under or over 5ft 9? Tough to say.
Bobby said on 21/Sep/18Definitely looks 5'9 but you can tell how 5'8 and 5'9 don't look much different in terms of eye level.
Editor RobHe's lowered his eyelevel by half inch at least in this shot.
khaled taban said on 18/Aug/185'9.25"/176cm
RedFire said on 25/Jul/18He seems more like a 5'8 in this pic, or else you were wearing taller shoes. A 5'9 is still looking a bit taller than this. A 5'9 usually have their head reach to the eyes, eyebrows of a 6'1. But I don't buy this guy as a 5'9.
Nik said on 7/Jul/18It is good to see the honesty of another 5 foot 9 er!
Denzo said on 9/May/18He's a good few inches smaller than me when met at doctor who convention and I'm 5'11.5 so I'd say he's around 5'9.
HonestSlovene said on 8/Oct/17He looks exactly 5'9".
Cameron said on 18/Sep/17Looks 176 in the above pic.
Aaron Kyro ( 6'0") said on 8/Aug/17I think he's bit shorter than 5'9"
rob said on 11/Jun/175ft10.1 out of bed
5ft9.8 morning
5ft9.7 lunch
5ft9.6 afternoon
5ft9.6 evening
5ft9.5 night
S.J.H said on 9/Jun/17He had more hair advantage than big rob giving that impression if he face straight will be 5'9.25
bear hugger said on 7/Jun/17he looks more 5ft 10
World Citizen said on 27/May/17A legit 5 ft 9 guy. Not shorter.
Ted said on 27/Apr/17Looks a solid 5'9 here, 5'9 1/4 maybe.
Mark(5'9.25 said on 28/Feb/17I would have said 176 cm if he tilted his head up, but this or 175.7 is arguable!
Editor Rob Simm is shorter in person than Jenny's sister who is just over 5ft 9.
Revan said on 10/Feb/17Solid 5'9"
Rampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 12/Dec/16Solid 5ft9 guy. Can't rule out 176cm either
S.J.H said on 20/Sep/16Good example of a 175cm person
truth said on 6/Jun/16Seems like a decent 5'9", only his lowered eyelevel can suggest less.
CD said on 3/Jun/16Exactly 5ft 9, not above or below
Peter 179cm said on 3/Jun/16Yep around 175cm,any chance he might be 176cm,Rob?
Editor Rob not impossible, I'd have said an honest 5ft 9 up close.
S.J.H said on 31/Aug/15Looks a good 5'9 but i'm curious how tall he claim?
BarelyLegal said on 4/Aug/15he's exactly 1.74
184.3cm (Night) said on 8/May/15@hhhh
He is tilting his head, look at the top of their heads Rob is shorter.
hhhh said on 6/May/15They look the exact same height
disz said on 19/Apr/15Spot on. Looked an inch shorter than 5'10 Andrew Lincoln in Boston Kickout and Human Traffic.
John86 said on 6/Nov/14Some of you guys need to get your eyes tested, claiming he looks 5'10 in the picture lol. He CLEARLY looks an inch taller than Rob, two is delusional..
5'9 dead on.
Vibram said on 26/Oct/14Always looked a bit small in Life In Mars to be honest, I guessed like 5ft7.  Surprised he's of average height. Maybe it was that long leather jacket with big collar only accentuating his narrow shoulders and slight frame?
delvin said on 1/Oct/14is 176 cm a good estimate for him ?
Editor Rob Jenny's sister si 176 on the nose and looks taller in person than him.
lelman said on 14/Oct/13@avi I feel a 2' difference is needed before you start feeling short. I don't feel short next to my 6' uncle, but next to my best friend whose just over 6'1" I feel small haha.
It also depends on gender I think, if I see a 5'11" guy next to me I feel normal, but when I see a 5'11" girl suddenly I feel short next to her, despite being the same height.
avi said on 13/Jul/13@rob
Looks 1/2 more but could be .7. Do you feel short next to someone who's barely inch taller? Cause I run into so many like this and the difference is actually small but I can feel it like its more.
Editor Rob I saw simm again at the natural history museum a week or so ago and 5ft 9 range I think he looks.
miko said on 30/Jan/13Was he arrogant Rob? I've heard he can be at times.
Editor Rob he was nice to folk from what I saw
Voiceless Dental Fricative said on 30/Jan/13Is him leaning his head forward giving him the illusion of extra height?
Editor Rob if you've as much hair thickness at your crown as he has (as opposed to it being totally flat) I don't think it makes much difference if you tilt your eyelevel a cm down.
Jamesy said on 18/Jan/13Yeah but rob do u agree he looks over 5'9 in the pic?
Editor Rob I think he looks the height he looks in person, 5ft 9
Jamesy said on 18/Jan/13Rob in your pic he looks 5'10.  Bigger footware?
Editor Rob he looked a 5ft 9 guy to me
Chad Bronson said on 4/Jun/12I saw him at the Sheffield Crucible a few weeks ago. Since we were looking down on him, he didn't appear all that tall, especially since his cast mate was at least six foot. I would have pegged him at about 5ft 7 - 8in, about the same height as me, but somehow I don't think that would be right...
Michael  said on 28/Nov/11Oddly he looks 6 ft at least in Doctor Who... surprised.
W E Mole said on 17/May/11Worked with him. Very good actor and decent chap. He likes a thick sole. He's around 5' 8.5"
big d said on 24/Mar/11Spot on with 5'9". Just walked past him in north london
Anonymous said on 1/Nov/08I dated him for a while and he was no more the 5 9"
Lmeister said on 15/Jul/08In the second last episode of Lakes you can see Marshall Lancaster and John Simm standing next to each other with similar shoes. John is maybe an inch taller not much more. I'll send you a screecap later...
Snoodle said on 22/Jun/08I'd say probably a 5"7' or 5"8', on Doctor Who he was significantly shorter than both John Barrowman and David Tennant. Either way, brilliant actor :)
Lmeister said on 10/Apr/08Finally he is closer to his real height. I'd give him 5ft8.5 compared to the other cast in Life on Mars. He wears the biggest heels in that show. He is a great talent on of the best actors right now.
louis,dr who fan#1 said on 9/Apr/08but i thought that a male timelord was at least 6 foot. maybe he's 6'2(an inch taller that david tennant)at 1 point he looked taller the david tennant looked talller. im about 5'9/5'10 but im only 14 so im still growing and this is going right off the conversation(lol)
Rebecca Wright said on 9/Mar/08No no no. he's much taller than that. I passed him on the high street and he's definitely 5'9.
Richey said on 9/Dec/07I met him a few months ago and he's pretty short...I'm a tiny 5'5 and I could easily look him in the eye with only a slight head tilt.I'd say he's 5'7-5'8"
Anonymous said on 1/Sep/07We met him the other day. I'd say 5'7" at most.
sithius said on 15/Aug/06Wow, I always thought him about 5'8 watching the life on mars series. I wouldn't say 5'10 though.. maybe 5'9?
anonoymous said on 25/Jun/06appears 3 inches smaller then philip glenister in life on mars (6ft) is john in the 5ft9 range?
