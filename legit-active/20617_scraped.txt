Announcements
New Bradbury Stamm Construction Hall of Ancient Life Opening Feb. 15!
The Museum’s highly anticipated new exhibition hall, the Bradbury Stamm Construction Hall of Ancient Life, opens to the public on Saturday, February 15! With around 300 fossils from across New Mexico, the Bradbury Stamm Construction Hall of Ancient Life completes the Museum’s exploration of prehistoric life and tells the story of 300 million years of evolution in what’s now New Mexico.
Learn about ancient sharks that swam the shallow seas that once covered New Mexico, follow tracks made by the largest arthropod to have ever lived on Earth, and view New Mexico’s oldest known fossil: a trilobite that lived around 500 million years ago. This exhibition will be on view on the Museum’s second floor.
Now Open: Conserving America’s Wildlands: The Vision of Ted Turner
Blending stunning wildland photography with never-before-seen fossils and other specimens from the museum’s Research Collections, Conserving America’s Wildlands: The Vision of Ted Turner paints a vivid picture of the deep history found in our wild places and the value of conservation. On view through the end of 2024.
More information about the new exhibit is available HERE. This exhibition is presented by Thornburg Investments.
Planetarium welcomes new, immersive performance
Starting on Dec. 8, head to the Planetarium for Mesmerica 360, a fully immersive music and art cinematic projection show. Mesmerica 360 blends the atmospheric music of James Hood with visually stunning graphics and imagery. For more information and to purchase tickets, go to: tickets.mesmerica.com/albuquerque.
Mammals put brawn before brains
Prehistoric mammals bulked up, rather than develop bigger brains, to boost their survival chances once dinosaurs had become extinct, research suggests.
For the first 10 million years after dinosaurs died out, mammals prioritised boosting their body size to adapt to radical shifts in the make-up of Earth's animal kingdom, researchers say. Read more
