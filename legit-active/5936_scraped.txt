What to Know
Critics Consensus
A beautiful, epic Western, Brokeback Mountain's love story is imbued with heartbreaking universality thanks to moving performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.

Ledger and Gyllenhaal deserve nothing but praise for their brave, sensitive portrayals of troubled souls...

Outlook
What is remarkable about the film is how it doesn't politicise the homosexuality theme, transcends it to become the story of two people in doomed love. The two lead characters are wonderfully delineated.
Rated: 3/4

Newsweek
Brokeback Mountain is in no rush. Its emotional impact builds slowly, its rhythms in tune with the countryside--the rugged grandeur of the mountains; the arid, bleak vistas of backwater Western towns.

Joe Lipsett
The Queer Gaze (Podcast)
20 years on, Brokeback Mountain remains a milestone of queer cinema. There's an interesting discussion to be had about the casting of straight actors and the depiction of intimacy, but the film's score and tragic ending remain iconic
Rated: 4/5

Battleship Pretension
It remains a rarely-surpassed high-watermark for both Ledger and Gyllenhaal, who were both nominated (it remains Gyllenhaal’s only nod), and who each capture something in their characters and something in themselves as actors that seems a tad elusive.

Sure, there are happier gay films out now, ones that involve more queer talent both in front of and behind the camera, but here I am still, clinging onto this masterpiece like Ennis holding onto that damn jacket.

I am incredibly broken by this movie. It's so emotionally moving.
I am probably the last person in the world who didn't watch it until now, and oh, I have been missing a masterpiece.
I cried like a baby.

Sadness all around.
Sad for the people, sad for the animals, sad for the mountain.
I realize that this film tells a story of two people who can’t be together because of societal resistance and hypocrisy, even violence against them.
But some of their actions are strange.
Why would you (Jack) marry a firey cowgirl if you know you are not ready to end your relationship with Ennis?
Why would not you (Ennis) at least find a better place to kiss Jack when he comes to visit with you?
Of course Alma will notice!
I mean, cheating is not nice, but normally people will try to hide it better.
Strange.
I like Loreen, Alma Jr. and Jack/Ennis’s boss the most here.
