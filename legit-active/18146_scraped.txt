Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania i/Àåp…õns·µªlÀàve…™nj…ô/ (Pennsylvania German: Pennsilfaani), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The state borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.
Pennsylvania is the 33rd largest, the 6th most populous, and the 9th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's five most populous cities are Philadelphia (1,560,297), Pittsburgh (305,801), Allentown (118,577), Erie (100,671), and Reading (89,893). The state capital is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82¬†km) of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92¬†km) of shoreline along the Delaware Estuary.
The state is one of the 13 original founding states of the United States; it was originally founded in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake.  It was the second state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787.  Independence Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were drafted, is located in the state's largest city of Philadelphia.  During the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of the state.

Pennsylvania (album)
Pennsylvania is Pere Ubu's eleventh studio album.  The album marks Tom Herman's return to Pere Ubu's studio work after a twenty-year absence.
Director's Cut
In 2005, to celebrate Pere Ubu's 30th Anniversary, a "Director's Cut" was released which featured new mastering, alternate mixes, and two bonus tracks.  David Thomas explains: "The point of doing a Director's Cut is to benefit from that older and wiser thing.  I reviewed all alternate mixes from the session, sometimes discovering that an earlier mix turned out to be superior to the chosen mix. As well, 10 years later, we have access to improved mastering technology. Consequently, there is a greater clarity and cohesion to the Director's Cut. We are not going to make both versions available. The Director's Cut is the way it's supposed to be. Period."

Thermite welding process for joiningrailway tracks #indian #railway #welding
Thermite reaction is the reaction used to join the
railway tracks. It is an exothermic redox reaction in
which more reactive aluminium metal replaces iron
from its oxide to produce molten iron which is used
for joining the railway tracks.
Welding work in railway is done by welder who is an
expert technician. Time management has to be given
a lot of attention in this work so that welding is
perfect. All this work is done by blocking the railway
line or it is done outside the railway line.

Driving Along PA Route 611 Bypass from Doylestown to Furlong
Hi Everybody, and Welcome to my Stevenofpa YouTube Channel. We're glad you're here!
This video shows you what it was like to drive along the PA Penna Pennsylvania Highway Route 611 bypass (which goes around Doylestown, PA, Bucks County, the county seat) and traveling southbound towards Furlong, PA. Then a left hand turn is made onto Edison-Furlong Road. You can see lots of cars and a motorcycle, too! The road changes from a 4-lane highway to a two-lane road.
The vehicle being driven is a 2006 Chevy Chevrolet Malibu sedan, black, with a grey interior.
Please post your questions and comments below, and Thanks for Watching. ENJOY!

Driving From Warrington To Doylestown, PA On PA Route 611 North
After catching some trains in Bristol, Pennsylvania I then headed to Doylestown to attend a university volleyball match so I decided to film driving on PA Route 611 North from Warrington to Doylestown in Bucks County. I've been on this major state highway before & got on it from the PA Turnpike a few minutes ago.
Thankfully I didn't encouter any traffic today since it was just after rush hour. This roadway runs from Interstate 95 in the southern part of Philadelphia north to Interstate 380 in Coolbaugh Township in the Pocono Mountains.

Hey, guess what. I also added a cool tune to this video as well! Again, for some reason, my videos from a few years ago, don't appear to have any sound in them. So I grabbed a song from the YouTube Audio Library, for your listening enjoyment. I hope you think it's cool too! This song is called:
Comfortable Mystery 2 - Film Noire Kevin MacLeod Ambient Calm 0:53

Hi Everybody, and Welcome to my Stevenofpa YouTube Channel. We're glad you're here!
This video shows you what it was like to drive along the PA Penna Pennsylvania Highway Route 611 bypass (which goes around Doylestown, PA, Bucks County, the county seat) and traveling southbound towards Furlong, PA. Then a left hand turn is made onto Edison-Furlong Road. You can see lots of cars and a motorcycle, too! The road changes from a 4-lane highway to a two-lane road.
The vehicle being driven is a 2006 Chevy Chevrolet Malibu sedan, black, with a grey interior.
Please post your questions and comments below, and Thanks for Watching. ENJOY!

After catching some trains in Bristol, Pennsylvania I then headed to Doylestown to attend a university volleyball match so I decided to film driving on PA Route 611 North from Warrington to Doylestown in Bucks County. I've been on this major state highway before & got on it from the PA Turnpike a few minutes ago.
Thankfully I didn't encouter any traffic today since it was just after rush hour. This roadway runs from Interstate 95 in the southern part of Philadelphia north to Interstate 380 in Coolbaugh Township in the Pocono Mountains.

Thermite welding process for joiningrailway tracks #indian #railway #welding
Thermite reaction is the reaction used to join the
railway tracks. It is an exothermic redox reaction in
which more reactive aluminium metal replaces iron
from its oxide to produce molten iron which is used
for joining the railway tracks.
Welding work in railway is done by welder who is an
expert technician. Time management has to be given
a lot of attention in this work so that welding is
perfect. All this work is done by blocking the railway
line or it is done outside the railway line.
Please like and subscribe my channel for railway
knowledge.

After catching some trains in Bristol, Pennsylvania I then headed to Doylestown to attend a university volleyball match so I decided to film driving on PA Route 611 North from Warrington to Doylestown in Bucks County. I've been on this major state highway before & got on it from the PA Turnpike a few minutes ago.
Thankfully I didn't encouter any traffic today since it was just after rush hour. This roadway runs from Interstate 95 in the southern part of Philadelphia north to Interstate 380 in Coolbaugh Township in the Pocono Mountains.
