Luton Town F.C.
Luton Town Football Club /ÀàluÀêt…ôn Ààta än/
is an English association football club based since 1905 at Kenilworth Road, Luton, Bedfordshire. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed "the Hatters" and affiliated to the Bedfordshire County Football Association. Its first team is contesting the fourth tier of English football, League Two, during the 2015‚Äì16 season. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous promotions and relegations, and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the First Division; the team won its first major honour, the Football League Cup, in 1988.
The club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined the Football League before the 1897‚Äì98 season, left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in 1955‚Äì56 and contested a major final for the first time when playing Nottingham Forest in the 1959 FA Cup Final. The team was then relegated from the top division in 1959‚Äì60, and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the Fourth Division from the 1965‚Äì66 season. However, it was promoted back to the top level by 1974‚Äì75.

Stacey Dooley investigates what is going on in her hometown of Luton and finds out why it is known as the extremist capital of Britain. Why is the far right on the rise? Media commentators all have their theories about what is happening there, but Stacey is uniquely placed to tell the story through the generation she grew up with - the people who are now shaping one of the most controversial towns in Britain. Stacey meets friends - some wearing veils and others who are fully-fledged EDL supporters. She goes to the heart of the Muslim community, dominated by one of the country's most extreme Muslim groups, meeting both self-proclaimed radicals and those trying to counter them. Is it all hype? Or is 'L-town' such a pick-and-mix of culture that e...

Luton are back under the Kenilworth Road floodlights on Tuesday night when Stoke City are the visitors to LU4.
Kev is joined by The Lutonian journalist James Cunliffe to look ahead to the game between two out of form sides.
The lads look at Stoke and where their strengths and weaknesses lie along with a few key figures to look out for before the attention turns to the home side and who could line up for them in amongst this latest injury crisis.
The boys point out the boxes that they would like to be ticked over the course of the 90 minutes as well as their score predictions.
Do either predict a Town win? Listen in to find out on the longest running, award-winning Luton Town podcast!

The Luton Town Supporters' Trust was created, and initially named Trust in Luton, in 2003 to help force out unpopular former owner John Gurney.
Current club chief executive Gary Sweet was part of the group that effectively forced the club into administration and out of Mr Gurney's control, for a new consortium to take over, headed up by Bill Tomlins.
Another change of ownership again brought problems and administration followed again in 2007, until the club was eventually bought out by the fan-led 2020 consortium, headed up by Sweet, which has now helped steer the history-making Hatters from the non-league to the Premier League.
The Supporters' Trust is a democratic, non-profit organisation run by fans for fans. The purpose of a Trust is to help fans to join together and strengthen their influence over the way Luton Town Football Club is run, and to improve the links between their club and the community it serves.
In a way, we‚Äôre like a union, believing that many voices are stronger than one and that the best way to influence the club is to represent many fans, not just ourselves.

Stacey Dooley investigates what is going on in her hometown of Luton and finds out why it is known as the extremist capital of Britain. Why is the far right on the rise? Media commentators all have their theories about what is happening there, but Stacey is uniquely placed to tell the story through the generation she grew up with - the people who are now shaping one of the most controversial towns in Britain. Stacey meets friends - some wearing veils and others who are fully-fledged EDL supporters. She goes to the heart of the Muslim community, dominated by one of the country's most extreme Muslim groups, meeting both self-proclaimed radicals and those trying to counter them. Is it all hype? Or is 'L-town' such a pick-and-mix of culture that extremists are attracted here like no other town in Britain?
#WarnerBros #WBITVP #FullEpisode #FreeTV
Stacey Dooley, born in 1987 in Luton, seeks to explore the truth behind her town‚Äôs divided reputation. Despite media portrayals of Luton as a hotbed of extremism, Stacey wants to investigate the real dynamics between the English Defence League (EDL) and Muslim extremists like Al Muhajiroun.
She revisits her old school, reconnects with childhood friends, and engages with both communities to understand their views. Stacey also visits Bury Park, a predominantly Asian area, where she faces hostility from extremists but insists this does not represent the majority.
Stacey‚Äôs journey includes meetings with EDL members such as Tommy Robinson (Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon) who was at the forefront the recent #UKRiots / #FarageRiots, as she explores the far right's rise in Luton, and delves into the complex discussions around Islam, including Sharia law and the radicalization of youth. Despite tensions, Stacey emphasizes that extremists on both sides are a minority, and stresses the importance of bridging divides in her hometown.

Luton Town F.C.
Luton Town Football Club /ÀàluÀêt…ôn Ààta än/
is an English association football club based since 1905 at Kenilworth Road, Luton, Bedfordshire. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed "the Hatters" and affiliated to the Bedfordshire County Football Association. Its first team is contesting the fourth tier of English football, League Two, during the 2015‚Äì16 season. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous promotions and relegations, and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the First Division; the team won its first major honour, the Football League Cup, in 1988.
The club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined the Football League before the 1897‚Äì98 season, left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in 1955‚Äì56 and contested a major final for the first time when playing Nottingham Forest in the 1959 FA Cup Final. The team was then relegated from the top division in 1959‚Äì60, and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the Fourth Division from the 1965‚Äì66 season. However, it was promoted back to the top level by 1974‚Äì75.
