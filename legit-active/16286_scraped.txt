Play as many holes as you could in 12 hours to trigger donations.  Joe and I rode together.  He finally hits a bad shot under some low-branched pine trees on hole # 58 or 59 and with a smile on his face turns to me and says ...Bill "how'd you like that trick shot?  Wait till you see the one coming up."   He was a good man.  Glad I had a chance to know him...Bill Carter.Joan and Alex FlewellynMay 31, 2011Dear Lynn, Kevin, Laura, Julie, Sarah and Jana,You all are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time of loss.  We are praying for God's mercy and grace to comfort you and keep you the days ahead.  There was no doubt that Joe loved his family and how proud he was of all of you.  Sitting while waiting on Thomas to be born, he talked of each of you and how pleased he was with your choices in life and the excitement of thinking of your futures.  He was a proud Papa Joe! The sparkle in his eyes when Thomas was born is something we will always remember.Our love and deepest sympathy,Joan and Alex FlewellynShowing 1 - 24 of 24 resultsMake a Donation in Joseph BISHOP's nameMemorial Events for Joseph BISHOPTo offer your sympathy during this difficult time, you can now have memorial trees planted in a National Forest in memory of your loved one.Plant TreesPlant TreesFuneral services provided by:Marshall-Donnelly-Combs Funeral Home - Nashville201 25th Ave North, Nashville, TN 37203Call: 615-327-1111How to support Joseph's loved onesHonor a beloved veteran with a special tribute of ‘Taps’ at the National WWI Memorial in Washington, D.C.The nightly ceremony in Washington, D.C. will be dedicated in honor of your loved one on the day of your choosing.Read moreAttending a Funeral: What to KnowYou have funeral questions, we have answers.Read moreShould I Send Sympathy Flowers?What kind of arrangement is appropriate, where should you send it, and when should you send an alternative?Read moreWhat Should I Write in a Sympathy Card?We'll help you find the right words to comfort your family member or loved one during this difficult time.Read moreView AllResources to help you cope with lossEstate Settlement GuideIf you’re in charge of handling the affairs for a recently deceased loved one, this guide offers a helpful checklist.Read moreHow to Write an ObituaryNeed help writing an obituary?
