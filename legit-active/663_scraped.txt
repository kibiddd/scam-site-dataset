Travelling with your children on Air Canada is simple!  Here are some useful tips for a seamless travel experience:
Family Check-in
Flying with kids under age 6? Make it easier by looking for Family Check-in signage at select airports¹.
Early Boarding
Kids under age 6 and their family board early², before general boarding. This means extra time to store belongings and settle in.
Family Seating
We’ll make sure you and your kids under age 14 sit close to each other at no extra charge³.
¹ Available for domestic and international departures from Toronto-Pearson Int. (YYZ) and Montreal-Trudeau Int. (YUL) airports, and for domestic flights from Vancouver, and Edmonton International airports.
² Make sure to be at the departure gate by the time indicated on your boarding pass to take advantage of pre-boarding between zones 2 and 3.
³ A fee may apply if you decide to change the free standard seat assignment provided, or if you select Preferred Seats.
Because families should stick together!
When you book your flight online, indicate that you are travelling with children, and we will assign generic seats in proximity to each other for you and your children before check-in. You can then review your seat assignment by going to My Bookings.
For Air Canada Vacations bookings, go to  the “View & Print Itinerary” link.
If you book directly with Air Canada Reservations, be sure to tell our agents that you’re travelling with a child under the age of 14, and they’ll make sure you’re seated close together at no extra charge.
If you did not book your travel via Air Canada directly, you can contact Air Canada Reservations to be seated, or go to My Bookings to review your reservation before check-in and validate your seat assignment.
If we are unable to seat one adult in close proximity to a child, you may contact Air Canada Reservations to change your booking to another flight on which we can provide proximity seating, or cancel your trip, all at no extra charge.
Choosing your own seats
For the best choice in seats, it’s always better to select them when you book your flight. Note that a fee may apply when choosing your seats in advance. A fee may also apply if you decide to change the free standard seat assignment provided, or if you select Preferred Seats.
Fun for Kids!
To keep the little ones happy, we offer a variety of cool giveaways on select flights. And don’t forget to check out the “Kids” section on our In-Flight Entertainment , which includes 75 hours of movies and games just for kids.
Goodies*
Special Luggage Tag
At the Family Check-in counter, your kids can pick up a special luggage tag. It’s a fun way to add personality to their bags and commemorate a trip.
Activity Books & More
On Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights within North America, we offer activity books to keep your kids entertained.
On international flights, your kids can enjoy new fun travel goodies, like a tote bag filled with things young explorers will love, including an activity book, a crayon kit, and more.
* Subject to availability.
Special Services
Meals
Special meals for infants and  children are available on all of our international flights and in Air Canada Signature Class, Business Class, Premium Economy and Premium Rouge on all flights.  You can order your special  meal at time of booking on aircanada.com, or by contacting Air Canada Reservations at least 24 hours prior to departure.
Formula, breast milk, juice and baby  food (in small containers) are permitted in carry-on baggage. Because onboard refrigeration may not always be available  on all aircraft types, the cabin crew is unable to look after these items on  board. We therefore ask that you bring these items in a small cooler to keep  them at the desired temperature. If available, extra ice may be provided as  needed.
Change tables
All our aircraft - with the  exception of a few Canadair (CRJ) regional aircraft - have changing tables in  the front or back lavatories.
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
If you have a normal pregnancy and no previous history of premature labour, you may travel by air up to and including your 36th week on Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge and Air Canada Express.
We’re also happy to support breastfeeding on board our aircraft, whenever safety permits.
Identification Requirements

Child Welfare  and Safety
Infants
For safety reasons, Air Canada recommends the use of a Child Restraint Device on board an aircraft rather than lap-holding your infant.
Children (age 2 and up)
Using a child restraint device is optional for children age 2  and up on an Air Canada aircraft. However, do not transition your child from a child restraint device to a seat belt if  your child is not tall enough and their legs are too short to bend over the  edge of the seat. These children are not  ready to wear a seat belt only as they will tend to slide under the seat  belt. Even when your child is properly seated, the seat belt will be pressing  against their abdomen rather than on their hips. In an emergency situation,  your child may be seriously or fatally injured.
Safety Regulations
Air Canada is bound by Transport Canada regulations with regard to  acceptable child restraint devices.
Only approved child restraint devices can be  used on board our aircraft. Most child restraint devices that are used  in cars can be used on an aircraft.
Canadian  Aviation Regulations do not allow an adult passenger (age 16 years and older),  at any time, to be in charge of more than one infant on board an aircraft. This  applies whether the infant is seated on the adult's lap or sitting in a child restraint  device in an adjacent seat.
Some  child restraint devices are a combination of a child restraint system and a  booster seat. To be acceptable for use in the aircraft, the internal harness  system must be installed and all child restraint device-labelling requirements  must be met. When used as a booster seat, the internal harness system is  removed and is not approved for use on board the aircraft.
The  use of a child safety seat or restraint device is:
Mandatory for an infant under 2 occupying a seat. Infants occupying a seat must be properly secured in their safety seat or restraint device whenever the seat belt sign is on. For the welfare and safety of your child, we recommend using a child restraint device for your child, especially during takeoff, landing and turbulence.
Optional for a small child,  dependent on the manufacturer's guidelines for the device's maximum weigh.
Air  Canada does not provide seat restraint devices for small children or infants. An infant for  whom a seat has been purchased must be properly secured in an approved child  restraint device.
Please consult our “Child Restraint Devices” tab to get information about acceptable Child  Restraint Devices, Prohibited Child Restraint Devices, Exceptions on the Air  Canada Signature Class, Weight Restrictions, Combination Systems, Checked  Baggage rules and Carry-on Baggage rules.
The age of  your child will determine which booking, seating and ticketing rules apply.  Please refer to the ‘Children and Travel’ tab for guidance on how to make sure you and  your child are seated close together.
Infants (under age 2)
An infant as young as 7 days can travel on an Air Canada  flight.
At no time can an adult passenger (16 years of age or older) be  responsible for more than one infant.
Whenever the seat belt sign is on:
An infant seated on a parent's lap must be held securely.  Lap held infants are not adequately secure during takeoff, landing and  turbulence. We recommend that you purchase a seat for your child and use a  child restraint device.
An infant for whom a seat is purchased must be properly secured in an approved  child restraint device.
Air Canada does not provide child restraint devices. See the ‘Child Restraint Policy’ tab on  this page.
Children (age 2 to under age 12)
The use of an approved child restraint device is optional for  children age 2 and up. See the ‘Child Restraint Devices’ tab.

† The discount on the adult fare does not apply to any taxes, fees, charges and surcharges.
†† The child’s fare applies only to children under age 12. Youngsters age 12 and up will pay the adult fare. If your infant child’s second birthday occurs between the departure and return segments of an international trip, you have the option to pay:
The full published child's fare for that flight (and be certain to have a confirmed seat both ways), or
The infant fare on the departure, and the published child's fare on the return. Call Air Canada Reservations to book this option.
Travelling with an infant or child  in the Air Canada Signature Class cabin
With exceptions, child restraint devices are not permitted. Call Air Canada Reservations for  details.
When occupying a Classic or Executive Pod in Air Canada Signature Class, a child age 2 to 7 must be seated directly in front of, directly behind or in an adjacent seat facing the accompanying parent or guardian.
The child and the accompanying guardian will receive a mandatory  briefing on the safety features of the Air Canada Signature Class cabin prior  to takeoff.
Please contact Air Canada Reservations whenever booking travel with young children in Air Canada  Signature Class to ensure the availability of appropriate seating.
Bassinets
If you're travelling with a young (or small) infant in Economy Class, you may request a bassinet in advance of travel by contacting Air Canada Reservations. However, we are unable to confirm availability until the time of your flight's departure.
Bassinets are assigned on a first come, first served basis, subject to availability at time of flight departure.
Bassinets may be provided on the following aircraft:
Boeing 787-9 (789)
Boeing 787-8 (788)
Boeing 777-300ER (77W)
Boeing 777-200LR (77L)
Airbus A330 (333)
For safety reasons:
Bassinets can be used only for infants weighing less than 12 kg (25 lb) who are unable to sit upright.
The cabin crew is responsible for installing the bassinet once the seat belt sign has been turned off.
Please note that bassinets are installed at bulkhead rows where armrests do not lift.
Strollers
You can bring one stroller for each child you are travelling with in addition to your carry-on and checked baggage allowance and regardless of your destination.
Air Canada strongly recommends the use of small collapsible umbrella type strollers.
Small strollers - with a collapsed diameter not exceeding 25.5 cm (10 in) and a length not exceeding 92 cm (36 in) - can be checked free of charge at the baggage counter or at the boarding gate. When accepted at the baggage counter, your stroller is delivered to the arrivals baggage hall at your final destination. When accepted at the boarding gate, it is delivered to you at the aircraft door at every point in your journey.
Large heavy strollers can only be checked at the baggage counter because gate facilities in airports are not designed to accommodate them. Additional baggage fees do not apply. Large strollers are also subject to space limitations, and there is a risk that they cannot be accommodated in the aircraft.
If you're travelling with a collapsible wagon, it should measure less than 25.5 cm (10 in) in diameter and 92 cm (36 in) in length while collapsed.
You can bring a collapsible wagon free of charge at the baggage counter or at your boarding gate. When checked at the gate, your wagon will be delivered to you at the aircraft door at every point in your journey.
When using an approved child restraint device for travel with an infant or child, it is the parent’s or guardian’s responsibility to be familiar with:
The device manufacturer’s installation instructions
The method of securing and releasing their infant or child from the device
The method of quickly releasing their infant or child from the restraint in the event of an evacuation
Approved child restraint systems

Prohibited Child Restraint Devices
Booster seats: a booster seat (or cushion) is defined as a removable device for use in a vehicle for the purpose of seating in an elevated position a person whose mass is 18 kg (40 lb.) or more. It is designed to be used with an automobile lap and shoulder belt and is therefore not approved for use in an aircraft.
Belly loops and vests or harness type devices.
Hammock-type seats, such as Fly LegsUp, Flyebaby.
Little Cargo® seats (notwithstanding any claims from manufacturers that they are approved for use in aircraft).
The following devices are not approved for use as a restraint device during taxi, take-off and landing, or at anytime the seat belt sign is illuminated; they can, however, be used for comfort at all other times during the flight.
Infant sling/wrap carriers similar to Snugli™ or Baby Bjorn™ are accepted in addition to the infant's carry-on allowance if required for use on board the aircraft. The parent or guardian will have to remove their infant from the carrier every time the seat belt sign is illuminated.
Infant beds similar to Flyaway Kids Bed, BedBox cannot block access to the aisle and must be stowed when the seat belt is illuminated.
Other important rules, regulations and exceptions
Air Canada Signature Class
For safety reasons, child restraint devices are not permitted in the Air Canada Signature Class cabin. Some exceptions apply. Contact Air Canada Reservations for details.
Infants under age 2 can travel in the Air Canada Signature Class cabin but must be held in the adult's lap.
When occupying a Classic or Executive Pod in Air Canada Signature Class, a child age 2 to 11 must be seated directly in front of, directly behind or in an adjacent seat facing the accompanying parent or guardian.
CARES™ child restraint devices cannot be installed in the Air Canada Signature Class cabin.
All approved devices must fit between the armrests of the seat. They must be installed according to the directions on the device and secured using the seat belt fitted on the aircraft seat.
Weight restrictions are specified on all child restraint devices.
Rear-facing devices are generally restricted to babies weighing less than 9 kg (20 lb.).
Forward-facing devices are generally restricted to babies or children weighing 9 to fewer than 30 kg (20 to 65 lb).
A combination system (i.e. both a child restraint system and a booster cushion) is accepted for in-flight use provided it is used as a child restraint system and the internal harness system is installed, and all labelling requirements are met. It must not be used in-flight as a booster cushion*, with the internal harness system removed.
Pouch-type infant carriers (e.g. Snugli™, Baby Hawk or Ergo) are allowed for use on Air Canada flights, except during take-off, landing, taxiing on the runway and at any time the seat belt sign is on.
A restraint device that cannot be restrained due to size, design, or damage must be transported as checked baggage, as it cannot be stowed under the seats or in the overhead bins.
Please contact your travel agent or Air Canada Reservations for more information and possible exceptions to these rules (e.g. medical reasons).
* A booster seat (or cushion) is defined as a removable device for use in a vehicle for the purpose of seating in an elevated position a person whose mass is 18 kg (40 lb.) or more. It is designed to be used with an automobile lap and shoulder belt and is therefore not approved for use in an aircraft.
Checked baggage rules
To/from all destinations, infants and children age 0 to 11 years may check a car seat or booster seat free of charge in addition to their regular baggage allowance.
Customers are asked to write their name and address on all devices with the use of an indelible (Sharpie-type) marker.
If you are travelling with a car seat for a child of 2 years and above, we recommend that you bring your car seat for use on board instead of checking it. Please refer to our Child Welfare and Safety section.
Carry-on baggage rules
A child restraint device may only be accepted as carry-on in addition to the infant's child carry-on allowance provided a seat has been purchased for the infant/child.
Infant sling/wrap carriers like Snugli™ or Baby Bjorn™ are accepted in addition to the infant's carry-on allowance if required for use on board the aircraft. These carriers are not approved for use as a "restraint device" and may not be used during taxi, take-off, and landing, or at any time the seat belt sign is illuminated. The parent or guardian will have to remove their infant from the carrier every time the seat belt sign is illuminated.
