Our community engagement initiative
Positive food habits for life
The Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation, is an Australian not-for-profit founded in 2004 by legendary cook Stephanie Alexander AO. Twenty years on, we are still fighting for the health and wellbeing of Australian children and young people by delivering fun, hands-on and inclusive food education across the country.
Our globally recognised and evidence-backed Kitchen Garden Program equips children with the skills to grow, harvest, prepare and share fresh, affordable and culturally diverse food, enabling them to develop positive food, wellbeing and sustainability skills for life.

The Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation would not be possible without our supporters. We rely entirely on the generosity, shared vision and commitment of schools and early childhood services, volunteers, philanthropic organisations, government, business and individuals.
The Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as traditional owners of the land on which we live and work, and we pay our respects to their elders, both past and present.
