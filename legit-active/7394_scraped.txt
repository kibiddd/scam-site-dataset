boss (Max Sylvester Hendrix) and his wife (Mary Bailley), wholesome,
green-eyed, dark-haired Wanda Hendrix was involved in her hometown's
little theater group when she was "discovered" by a passing talent
agent and signed up by Warner Bros. Her family
moved to California.Forgoing bit parts, the petite and lovely up-and-comer was immediately
featured in featured roles in both
Confidential Agent (1945) and
Nora Prentiss (1947) for Warner
Bros. and
Welcome Stranger (1947) for
Paramount. Signing up with Paramount, she earned one of her best film
roles with
Ride the Pink Horse (1947),
in which there was talk of an Oscar nomination, and appeared elsewhere
in the light comedy
Miss Tatlock's Millions (1948)
and the melodrama
My Own True Love (1949).After appearing on the cover of Coronet magazine, decorated WWII
hero-turned-Universal star
Audie Murphy took notice and
arranged a meeting with her. They married on February 8 1949, and she
co-starred with him a year later in one of his western vehicles,
Sierra (1950). The marriage had problems
from the beginning. Audie, who wanted her to give up her career,
suffered from flashbacks and paranoia from his traumatic war-time
experiences and often held her at gunpoint during violent episodes. The
frightened woman left him after only seven months and divorced him soon
after, charging him with mental cruelty. The final decree came on April
14, 1950.The negative publicity that came out of their stormy marriage did
little to enhance Wanda's status in Hollywood and, after a few standard
oaters and war yarns, the more notable ones being
Captain Carey, U.S.A. (1949)
co-starring Alan Ladd,
The Highwayman (1951) with
Charles Coburn, and
Roger Corman's
Highway Dragnet (1954) with
Richard Conte, her career waned.
The actress retired completely from pictures in 1954 to marry
millionaire playboy and sportsman James L. Stack, Jr., brother of actor
Robert Stack. She earlier appeared with her
famous brother-in-law in the films
Miss Tatlock's Millions (1948)
and My Outlaw Brother (1951).The career sacrifice did little to help the marriage and the couple
divorced in 1958. Returning to acting, she made a comeback on stage,
film and TV but experienced little progression. Overlooked in her three
1960s films, her last film roles were filmed in the early 1970s.
"Mystic Mountain Massacre", co-starring
Ray Danton, was never released, and the Civil
War horror
One Minute Before Death (1972),
based on a short story "The Oval Portrait" by
Edgar Allan Poe, in which she
co-starred with Barry Coe and
Gisele MacKenzie, died a quicker death
than even the title suggests.In 1969, she married a third and last time, to oil company executive
Steve La Monte in Las Vegas. At one point, she considered collaborating
with author Douglas Warren on an autobiography of her first husband,
Audie Murphy, but it never came to
fruition. Divorced from her third husband in 1980, Wanda died shortly
thereafter at age 52 of double pneumonia in Los Angeles. She had no
children.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.netFamilySpousesSteven LaMonte(June 7, 1969 - November 17, 1980) (divorced)James Stack(June 26, 1954 - November 3, 1958) (divorced)Audie Murphy(February 8, 1949 - April 19, 1951) (divorced)TriviaSister-in-law of actor Robert Stack at one time, she served as Stack's
matron of honor when he married actress Rosemarie Stack in 1956.Developed a drinking problem in the 1960s due to the few acting roles she was offered.Her marriage, after a two year-engagement, to Audie Murphy was a disaster. The World War II hero suffered from traumatic stress disorder and was prone to fierce jealousy, yet slept with other women. He kept a gun under his pillow and also gambled away all of Wanda's money betting on horses. Despite breaking up after a year, she continued to love him and was devastated after he died in a plane crash in 1971.Interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Burbank, California.Ex-aunt-in-law of Elizabeth Stack and Charles Stack.1 moreAllQuotes[in 1971 interview] I'd love to work again but young people are now in casting and they don't know my name or my work. The industry has changed so very much.
