Premature ejaculation (PE) spray is a topical product created to help delay orgasm. Delay or PE sprays contain desensitizing ingredients such as benzocaine, lidocaine, or Promescent that serve to dull sensation in the penis so that men can last longer during sexual intercourse.
While these products may appear appealing for those who suffer from subjective PE – at least three out of four use occasions with their partner – do they really work?
What are premature ejaculation sprays and do they work?
First, not all delay sprays are the same; some contain benzocaine and lidocaine – topical anesthetics for decreasing sensation in the skin. These ingredients block nerve signals from carrying sexual stimulation to their brain, which can slow ejaculation down significantly but won’t eliminate it completely.
How does a premature ejaculation spray work?
According to product manufacturers, these products addressed safety concerns about using local anesthetic on sensitive areas. Many delay sprays are designed to be applied directly to the penis shaft and glans, producing a slight numbing effect within minutes. This can help prolong sexual intercourse for those with PE or erectile dysfunction (ED).
So how do you use delay spray?
Delay spray typically comes in small bottles containing enough product for three-to-five uses per bottle; users should start by spraying two-to-three pumps of this solution onto their genital region – not all over it! Users may need more than one spray depending on your sensitivity level. It is important that after using any topical anesthetic to wait a few minutes before engaging in sexual activity – or using oral sex. This is because the active ingredients need time to fully absorb into their skin and take effect, otherwise there may be an excess spray left on your partner’s genitals that can cause skin irritation upon contact.
Which premature ejaculation sprays are best?
Generally speaking, benzocaine-based delay sprays tend to work faster than lidocaine based products like Promescent Delay Spray as they have fewer particles per volume making them easier for the body to use quickly when necessary. However, this does not mean one type is better than the other. It all depends on your level of sensitivity and desired effect, as well as whether or not you have any allergies to particular ingredients.
Are there any safety concerns when using premature ejaculation sprays?
While most delay sprays are considered safe for use by adults 18+, it’s always important to consult with a doctor before trying them out in order to make sure they don’t interfere with current medications one might be taking. Similarly, those who suffer from sensitive skin should avoid such products altogether due to their potential risk of allergic reaction – including increased itching/swelling, redness and rashes – which could be exacerbated further if used in combination with latex condoms.
How long does a premature ejaculation spray last?
Generally speaking, most delay sprays will start to wear off after about 30 minutes or less depending on the brand/formula being used as well as how much was applied; there are usually no lasting effects beyond that point. However, it’s important to note that not all brands have been tested for safety so individuals should consult product labels carefully before applying any PE-related products.
Finally, those suffering from lifelong premature ejaculation might find that using a delay spray isn’t enough to treat their condition, as some may need other forms of therapy such as pelvic floor muscle exercises or even generic Cialis. That being said, these sprays can provide relief in the short-term and serve to prolong sexual intercourse for those who are looking for ways to control ejaculation naturally.
Key Take Aways
Premature Ejaculation (PE) sprays have become increasingly popular over recent years with many brands claiming they can help men last longer during sex. However it is important not all delay products will work equally well; benzocaine based sprays may work faster than lidocaine-based products.
Moreover, not all delay sprays have been tested for safety so individuals should consult product labels carefully before using any PE related product.
When used correctly and in the right doses promescent Delay spray can help men with lifelong premature ejaculation to last longer during sexual intercourse or increase sensitivity to enhance a more pleasurable experience without needing excess amounts of medication or other forms of treatment such as pelvic floor muscle exercises.

When many guys first realize they have a problem with premature ejaculation they will get on the internet and start looking for a solution. One of the first proposed solutions you are likely to come across is a premature ejaculation pill consisting of natural extract that it is claimed will help you maintain control over your ejaculation during intercourse. But do these premature ejaculation pills actually work? Let’s find out.
More Effective Alternatives?
Before we take a look at the various types and brands of pills you should be aware that there are alternative ways to treat premature ejaculation that tend to have better long-term results.
Specifically, a premature ejaculation training program that teaches you to develop control naturally through a series of exercises and tactics. By far the best of these is Mike Anderson’s recently released Beyond Delay program which has been producing outstanding results since its release. If you try using PE tablets we recommend that you also give this guide a go as well. On his website, Mike goes into a great deal of detail about how his program works and what it covers.
Not All Pills Are Equal
Ok, now let’s get back to looking at and reviewing the range of premature ejaculation pills available for men.
While many of the companies selling premature ejaculation pills tend to make a number of exaggerated claims as to the results they deliver, it does appear that for at least some men an increase in lasting time and sexual control is attained.
The only true way to know how you will respond to these tablets is to try them yourself and gauge the results. Luckily most companies selling premature ejaculation pills offer a refund on the purchase if you are not satisfied so it is relatively easy and risk-free to give them a try.
Below are the 2 most effective pills for PE and we recommend that you make your choice from these three brands as many other products marketed are of lesser quality and have been reported to not honor the refund policies listed on their sites.
Delay Premature Ejaculation Pills
Delay is a very popular choice for men looking to last longer in bed and has earned itself a great reputation from users and industry experts alike. formulated by a group of pharmaceutical scientists, nutritionists, and relationship and sexual health professionals, Delay premature ejaculation pills are probably the most popular tablets on the market having been successfully used by thousands of men. They are priced quite reasonably and offer a full refund on all purchases.
You can check out the Delay site here
ProSolution+
ProSolution+ is another great choice. It’s a premium product and is more expensive than some of the standard pills, but has a much more potent mix of active ingredients than all the other pills we have looked at. If you are serious about stopping your premature ejaculation and don’t mind spending a few extra bucks for a top-notch product then this will be the choice for you.
Here’s the ProSolution+ site.
A Combo Method
If you are really serious about giving yourself the best chance of stopping premature ejaculation it may be best to try a combination of premature ejaculation pills while at the same time completing a premature ejaculation program such as the Beyond Delay system discussed above. After all, the more methods you try the quicker you will find the treatment method that will work for you.
For a more detailed look at premature ejaculation pills, what’s in them, and how they stack up as a premature ejaculation treatment check out Dan Becket’s rundown on this treatment method
Ejaculation Freedom Review: Is This Popular PE Program Worth It? Last Longer In Bed Guides / By
Mark Isud
If you are thinking about purchasing and using Dan Becket’s popular Ejaculation Freedom program read this first. Because as good as the course is, it’s not for everyone.
First up, if you’re not yet familiar with the Ejaculation Freedom program by Dan Becket, here’s a quick rundown. It is a downloadable program to help men treat premature ejaculation through a series of exercises and “re-programming techniques” that are claimed to help most men who complete the course last 20 minutes longer in bed.
Sounds too good to be true right? Well, it may be for some men. But for guys who can apply themselves and are apple to complete the exercises, this is a great way to cheaply and privately extend your ejaculatory latency; which is just a fancy way of saying that you’ll last longer in bed.
On the site, this article on the techniques men can use to last longer in bed gives a good rundown of what the program does. If you haven’t read it already it’s well worth the read.
Who Shouldn’t Use The Ejaculation Freedom Program?
While most guys who suffer from premature ejaculation are going to get a lot from Ejaculation Freedom, it’s probably not the best choice for some men.
Men With Religious Limitations
While the guide is very professionally written, a few of the exercises involve what most would consider a form of masturbation or self-stimulation. So if you are a devoutly religious person belonging to a faith that absolutely prohibits any form of self-stimulation you may not be able to complete all the training exercises.
You’ll still get a lot out of the other parts of the guide. For example, the meditative and visualization training (which may well be even more powerful) will be fine.  The same goes for the Kegel training and sexual technique modules.
Guys With Limited Privacy
For some of the exercises, you will need some privacy where you can relax, focus and feel confident that you won’t be disturbed. If you’re a guy living alone you’ll likely have ample opportunity to complete the exercises which took me about 20 minutes, 4 or 5 days a week when I used the program.
If you are a married guy, perhaps with kids it may be more challenging to find some “alone time” where you know you won’t be disturbed. If you have a supporting wife or partner that can definitely help, but let’s be honest, a lot of guys are going to want to complete the program in secret due to the unfortunate stigma that is sometimes attached to premature ejaculation.
You’ll Need To Be Self-motivated
Most guys are going to be fine with this and have ample motivation to complete all the training modules. After all, they are not overly difficult or challenging and are actually pretty fun. Plus the rewards of being able to have enjoyable sex and satisfy your partner should be more than enough to keep you motivated for the 4 to 6 weeks it will take you to complete all the training.
However, if for whatever reason you are the type of guy who lacks self-discipline and finds it hard to complete things then you may be better of seeing a coach or sexual counselor face to face to give you that extra motivation and support.
How Does The Ejaculation Freedom program work?
Now let’s get into the nuts and bolts of how the program actually works, what exercises you’ll be doing, and how long it will be until you start improvements.
Dan does a very good job of explaining this on his site so I won’t go into that much detail here. but I will focus on the parts that worked for me the most and my personal experiences completing the program.
Mindset changes
At the start of the program, you’ll be encouraged to make some seemingly simple mindset changes about the way you approach sex. In hindsight, this now seems like basic stuff, but unexpectedly it is one of the things that helped me the most.
The first change was to not look at me PE as something wrong with me. And instead, view ejaculation control as a skill I was about to learn. It’s a really small shift in thinking but it helped me a lot.
The second shift was to not think of my ejaculation as this force or pressure that builds up and I have to hold back. But as a simple function that I could learn to control.  Again it’s a small shift in thinking which really helped and prepared me for the actual training.
Turnback Training
I would say that the turnback training is the part that helped me the most. It’s a series of edging exercises but it’s really different from the traditional types of edging that you see everywhere. Once I got to the point where I could “turn back” once during sex it wasn’t long before I could do it over and over.
Visualization Techniques
These were also really useful. I found that I could use these during sex and often minutes would go by in a sort of “lost in the moment” state where I wouldn’t even be worried or thinking about ejaculating early. These visualizations allowed me to link up my mind with the new techniques.
Random Tips
Some of the things that helped me the most were the small and almost random tips that Dan would throw in when describing a situation, technique, or position. For example, we would say “if you a losing control here, try circling your tongue around the roof of your mouth 4 times” or “at this point put your hands on her upper back and run them over the tip of her shoulder blades while focusing in”. They almost always seemed to work. It’s amazing how such a small tip or change can sometimes make all the difference.
Will You Really Be Lasting 20 minutes every time?
On the Ejaculation Freedom website, Dan makes the bold claim that on completion of the program “all men will be able to last 20 minutes or more during sex”. Let’s be honest, this sounds too good to be true, especially for you guys who experience severe premature ejaculation.
In my case, I was able to get to this point after about 6 weeks. However, I don’t always choose to go this long as I can usually bring my partner to orgasm sooner than this. I found that after finishing the Ejaculation Freedom program that I stopped thinking about time during sex. However, I am always present and notice my arousal levels as they go up and down during sex (Dan calls this “riding the wave”).
Another thing I noticed is that after a finished the program and began lasting longer my orgasms became much longer and intense. I wasn’t really expecting this by I must say that it’s a great side effect.
Is It Worth The Money
I just checked and the program is currently discounted to $49 (Which is a lot less than I paid for it a while back) which makes it one of the best value options. It’s cheap, you can do it in private on your own, and it’s just really easy to get started. So, in my opinion, the money probably won’t even be a consideration for most guys who are forever missing out on great sex due to their premature ejaculation.
If you decide to see a sex counselor for a series of consultations (which is also recommended) you are likely to be paying $1000 dollars and up, so I think this is a very cheap way to tackle your premature ejaculation.
Are There Better Programs For Premature Ejaculation?
The other books on premature ejaculation that I have purchased were not in the same league as Ejaculation Freedom. The only superior alternative I could imagine would be to find a good sex counselor who specializes in premature ejaculation (or try to book sessions with dan himself).
There are some good general books on sex and relationships that I recommend, and that may also help your premature ejaculation somewhat. But they lack the detail and specific training exercises that you’ll find in the EF program.
Where To Download Ejaculation Freedom By Dan Becket?
The course can be downloaded directly from EjaculationFreedom.com. The Ejaculation Freedom book is a PDF file and can be saved to your computer or smart file. It looks like they no longer sell a hard copy physical book as I’m guessing most guys would prefer to download everything these days. After all, it’s not the kind of book you’d have lying around on your coffee table or prominently displayed on the bookshelf.
Here’s the main website: ejaculationfreedom.com

Good luck. And if you do finish the program please let me know how it went.

Now that you are through that all-important phase, you can move to a more standard pace.
How To Tune In During Sex
Together with your physical methods, you should also enhance your emotional techniques and control during intercourse because this is where most men get it wrong. The important thing with this is to get into the habit of emphasizing the massive amount of sensations that you will be encountering. Lots of men get it wrong by trying to divert themselves during sexual intercourse, but the trick is to alternatively really pay attention to all of these sensations, and not merely what’s happening in the genital section.

Despite the fact that just about all individuals are different in both mind and body, if you confront premature ejaculation there’s a very good possibility that you can blame it on one or more of the discussed reasons. And don’t worry if you are familiar with a handful of these causes in yourself because they can all be addressed without difficulty.
For a more detailed look at the causes of premature ejaculation, we recommend reading Dan Becket’s great article on the topic of PE triggers and how to prevent them.
Gene history
We quite often forget about our inherited genes and how all humans have developed, considering this is one factor that can be more often than not neglected for males troubled with this trouble. Whilst most couples may want your sessions to go for as long as you want, your own body in most cases has different intentions. This is because where our body is involved, the most crucial thing is always to make sure that an individual’s seeds are transferred through to a succeeding generation and not whether or not you give your lover a climax.
The mental side of intercourse
It’s undoubtedly true that in the case of some of us, the state of the psychological areas can certainly play a key part in whether you will preserve control during sexual intercourse. Any time our thinking begins to feel pressurized, it will in many instances go on to hinder the physical segments of your body promoting too much muscular strain. At this moment your entire ejaculation system will probably start to firm up, at once creating premature ejaculations.
Masturbatory arousal
When many males are in adolescence and find out about masturbatory arousal, quite a few teenagers accumulate harmful habits as they attempt to finish as rapidly as is possible. In fact, the method by which young males pleasure themselves is more or less teaching the body along with their ejaculatory system to warm up then finish incredibly swiftly. In the aftermath of all this attention given to having an orgasm promptly throughout self-stimulation, when you start serious romantic relationships, that added stimulation is generally, too much to withstand leading to a hair-trigger response.
Bodily understanding
Numerous males not to mention a number of medical doctors pay no attention to this contributing factor, however, to me it’s among the more important areas with little doubt. Perhaps you could now determine what amount you genuinely comprehend pertaining to what happens inside your body during intercourse. With regard to a good number of males, it is perhaps next to nothing. The truth is, regardless of who you might be, you’ll need to practice as to learn precisely how to be in charge of your ejaculatory responses to turn out to be amazing during sexual intercourse. Actually, by making use of some of the most effective ebooks for preventing quick ejaculation, most males should certainly see large end results by understanding the concepts of the rules of ejaculation control.
Moving Forward
When you return to this checklist you should be fairly quickly able to have no trouble choosing which reasons are relevant for you. And don’t stress in the event you recognize a few triggers from the list, due to the fact that an excellent how to last longer in bed plan, for example, this popular one can quickly develop your performance. Most guys affected by rapid climaxing presume that they’re pretty much stuck with it, however, this isn’t the case. PE actually is highly manageable if you employ the correct strategies.

Regretfully, you will find certain faulty guidance over the internet regarding the causes of a lack of control in bed and exactly how it can be effectively treated. Here are a number of the more common rapid ejaculation treatment selections and a look into each of their usefulness.
Sensitivity Lowering Creams
Desensitizing premature ejaculation sprays in many cases are promoted to folks troubled by PE to make an effort to help reduce the arousal of sexual intercourse. The product can be applied to the genital area well before intercourse and generally takes a few mins to begin functioning.
I recommend that you don’t use many of these materials because there are more than a few negatives. Despite the fact that all these products can assist some folks to last longer during sex in some circumstances, all these sprays seem to in addition, decrease the enjoyment of sexual activities.
Likewise, in the event that a small volume of such a solution touches your partner, she is going to promptly lose a decent degree of arousal, leaving sexual activities extraordinarily monotonous from then on in.
Quite a few men might even have to endure unwanted skin allergic reactions to some of such sprays.
Condoms With Desensitizing Agents
Lately, various brands of prophylactics have begun being publicized towards adult men afflicted with ejaculation problems. A local anesthetic matter is added within the inside of this condom which results in an anesthetic effect within the penile tip.
Though these rubbers might benefit just a few guys battling with mild to moderate pe, they are definitely ineffective as a permanent cure, seeing as the method will come with lots of of the equivalent side effects as local anesthetic balms.
Medication
Big pharma organizations are making an attempt to invent a premature ejaculation prescription drug for a lack of control in bed with very little progress.
Nevertheless, a couple of medications may be in some cases prescribed to adult men troubled by a lack of sexual control.
The collection of prescription drugs tend to be grouped as SSRIs. Even though selected males will be accepted as a medication for a lack of sexual control, sufficient care has to be employed if deliberating on this course of action.

Premature Ejaculation Pills

The best possible rapid ejaculation systems should not just look at a particular component. What they need to do is include both the mental and the internal solutions, using an uncomplicated fashion.
