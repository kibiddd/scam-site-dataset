ULTRASOUND TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The Minnesota Rural Health Association (MRHA) received a grant from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust to help fund tuition assistance for healthcare organizations serving rural and underserved communities in Minnesota to increase their ultrasound services and ensure ultrasound services continue within their community.
Through this tuition assistance program, MRHA will provide healthcare organizations in rural and underserved communities with funding to cover tuition, study materials, and testing fees.
This funding is part of a $26.4 million initiative by the Helmsley Charitable Trust to provide hospitals and health centers with ultrasounds and sonography training to benefit rural and underserved communities in Minnesota.
