Filing for Bankruptcy in Georgia
Filing for individual bankruptcy can be confusing and frustrating if you are not familiar with the process. At Duncan & Brow, Attorneys at Law, we help streamline that process so you can feel at ease as we walk you through your options, the necessary steps, and eventually lead you to financial freedom and independence. Filing for bankruptcy in Georgia is unique in comparison to filing in other states, and depending on your personal circumstances and financial situation, it will either allow you to discharge your debts (Chapter 7 bankruptcy) or allow you to repay your debts through a court-approved repayment plan (Chapter 13 bankruptcy).
If you need a bankruptcy attorney in Georgia, look no further than Duncan & Brow, Attorneys at Law. With decades of experience, we help individuals and families get a fresh start by filing for bankruptcy.

CHAPTER 7
Chapter 7 allows individuals or married couples to eliminate credit card bills, medical bills, and other unsecured debts. In most cases, because of property exemptions under Georgia law, there are no eligible assets to sell and you will be able to retain your assets.

CHAPTER 13
Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a reorganization of debt that allows individuals and married couples with reliable income to consolidate their debt obligations and catch up on important payments they have fallen behind on. If you are behind on a car loan or your mortgage, filing Chapter 13 can help you get those loans back on track.
