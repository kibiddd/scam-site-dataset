WILLIAM  AND  ANNE  ROBINSON.
y\
^  T^ILLIAM  ROBIXSOX,   gentleman,    of   Dorchester,    .^fasfa-
cluisetts,  the  central  figure  of  this  family  -sketcli,  was
desceiulcd  from  that  Wii-liam  Kobixson  wiiose  name  appearci
among  tlie  early  settlers  of  old  Dorchester.
Until  recent  years  there  was  room  for  doubt  wlielher  the  later
^Villiam  was  a  descendant  of  the  earlier  man  of  the  same  name,  or
of  Jamp:s  Robixsox,  who  was  also  prominent  in  the  councils  of  the
town.  The  fortunate  preservation  of  original  documer;ts  in  two
brandies  of  tlie  descendunts  of  the  elder  ^\'illiam  establislie^  the  lino
as  it  was  publicly  announced  in  the  X.  E.  Historical  and  Genealogical
Register,  ix.  339,  upon  the  authority  of  Dr.  Edward  Jlobinson,  of
Xevr'  York  City.
1.  William'  Robixsox,  the  emigrant,  first  appears  in  our  Xcw
England  history,  as  a  member  of  the  Church  in  Dorclif-ster  in  the  year
1G3G.  His  name  is  in  the  list  of  Freemen  of  IS  May.  Itj-i2,  raid
on  the  rolls  of  the  Ancient  and  Honorable  Artillery  Company  of
Boston  in  the  following  year.
Xotl'iing  v/hatever  is  known  of  his  parentage  or  birtli-jilace.  flis
name  does  not  appear  in  any  of  the  shipping  lists  thrit  liave  i.  eea
found,  nor  is  there  on  record  anything  by  which  his  age  can  be
more  than  approximately  ascertained.  If  he  were  twenty-iive  at
the  birth  of  his  first  child,  he  may  have  been  born  in  1GL5,  or  even
much  earlier.
His  first  recorded  purchase  of  real  estate  was  Feb.  25,  10>ol,
when  he  obtained  from  John  Phillips,  of  Boston,  for  the  sum  of  £150,
an  estate  in  Dorchester  ''near  unto  Xaponsett  Ivivcr/*  with  tlie  hou:-e,
barns,  etc.  thereon,  together  with  several  adjacent  and  outlvin'^'
parcels  ot"  uphnid  and  meadow.
In  IthU,  Oct.  7,  he  sold  for  £[U]  to  Tiniotliy  Tileston  of  Dor-
chestc!-,  cooper,  a  ''little  lionse"  and  ten  acres  of  land  on  "TiJe-niill
Creeke,  and  half  a  corn  water-nii!l  standing  on  tlic  tide  in  tlic
creeke,  coninioniy  calletl  Salt  Creekc  or  Brooke,  near  Ca[>taine's
Xcck."  It  is  s;iid  tiiat  this  mill  he  had  bought  of  Edward  l>reek.
For  more  than  two  hundred  years  it  lias  been  known  as  "  Tileston's
Mill,"  and  was  standing  though  probably  altered,  as  lute  as  l^^f -37.
lie  was  made  Town  Constable  in  1G.30,  and  Kater  or  Assessor  for
tlie  years  1G58,  10 GO  and  IGGl.
His  wife,  and  the  mother  of  his  children,  was  that  ^Margaret,  wb.o
was  ]i\ing  as  late  as  7  Oct.  1GG4,  when  she  united  with  hiui  in  a
conveyance  to  Timothy  Tileston.  He  married  a  secontl,  Ursula,  the
widow  of  Samuel  llo-ier,  but  earlier  ;tiil,  the  widov,-  of  Ste[ihen
Strccter,  whose  5t<;)ry  may  be  read  in  the  Register, '■■  xxxvi.  1Gl%
and  whom  he  must  have  taken  to  wife  after  July,  IGGo.f
"William  Kobinson  died  6  July,  IGG-S.  As  told  in  Eev.  John
Elliot's  Diarv,  lie  was  "drawn  through  bv  v''  coiiwhcel  of  liis  mill.
and  was  torn  in  pieces  and  slain."  The  place  of  his  burial  is  un-
known.
His  v,  idow,  Ursula,  married  15  July,  1G73,  Griffin  Crafts  of
Roxbury,  for  her  fourth  and  last  husba;id.
In  the  files  of  the  Suffolk  Co.  Probate  is  this  paper  : —
"' My  will  is  that  after  the  burial!  of  my  Bcly  &  my  debts  liounosrlj

2.     Samuel'  Robinsox  (  Vi'ilUam^),  called  by  his  father  his  "  eldest  son,"
and  without  doubt  the  child  that  was  baptized  June  1-1,  1640,  was
*  Orisinal  MS.  in  the  bands  of  a  descendant  of  Samuel  in  1SS7.
a  resident  of  Dorchester,  and  became  proiniiicnt  in  civil  affairs,  lie
was  chosen  Constable  in  1C6G-7,  Kater  or  Assessoi'  in  1077.  1G80,
'S2, 'S8  and '84;  vSelectman  in  1GS8  ainl  ICO'l;  R'-pro-entative  in
1701  and  DepiUv  in  17u2.  In  the  town  and  chnrrh  rt'Cord>  his
nanie  is  usually  distingnished  by  the  prefix  of  respect.  "  Mr."
He  was  prosperous  and  acquired  a  good  estate.  By  his  father's
will  he  inherited  all  of  the  real  proj^erty  excepting  the  portions  l^e-
queathed  to  his  l)rotluT  Increase.  Of  the  extent  and  valiui  ui  his
inheritance,  unfortunately  there  is  no  record.  The  fir>t  purchase  of
lands  by  him  that  appears  in  the  Registry  of  Deeds  was  under  date
of  l)ec.  IS,  167G,  when  Jonathan  Hill  conveyed  to  him  one  acre
'•'  v\ithin  the  great  Lots,"  abutting  upon  his  own  pi'operty  there.  Ou
the  second  of  May,  1715,  wdien  seventy-live  years  of  age,  he,  with
"  the  free  consent  of  3Iary  his  wife,"  executed  a  conveyance  to  his
"eldest  son  Samuel  Ivobiusou  of  Dorchester,  husbandman,"  v.hich
is  of  such  importance  in  a  genealogical  sense,  as  to  warrant  more
than  a  passing  notice  here.  It  embraced  all  that  ''  certain  Messuaa:e
or  Tenement  and  several  parcels  of  land  hereinafter  mentioned  and
described  lying  Scituate  iu  Dorchester  aforesaid.  That  is  to  say,
my  dwelling  house,  outhouses"  etc.,  "  land,  pastures,  Salt  and  Fresh
meadows  containing  in  the  whole  Sixty  acres  be  it  more  or  less,
butted  and  bounded  Westerly  in  j^art  with  the  Country  road  and
partly  with  the  Land  of  Major  Robert  Spurr  and  partly  with  the
land  of  Thomas  Lions,  Northerly  partly  with  the  Land  of  James
Trott  and  in  part  with  the  Land  of  Samuel  Trott,  Easterly  with  the
Land  of  Samuel  Trott  in  part,  and  partly  with  the  land  formerly
Samuel  Hill's,  Southerly  in  part  with  the  highway  that  leads  through
Dorchester  to  Naponset  Mill,  and  partly  with  Land  belonging  to  tlie
heirs  of  Ouesiphorus  Tilestone."  This  was,  undoubtedly,  the  home-
stead inherited  from  his  father,  William  Robinson,  and  augmented  by
later  purchases  of  his  own.  The  conveyance  also  included  a  lot  in
the  Six  Acre  Lots  on  the  south  side  of  the  road  to  Xaponset,  four-
teen acres  of  salt  marsh  ou  the  Naponset  River,  nine  acres  in  the
First  Division,  eleven  acres  of  woodland  abutting  upon  the  '•  Five
hundred  Acres  Town  Land,  known  by  that  Name,"  thirty-four  and
a  half  acres  "lying  near  a  place  called  Mother  Brooks,"  on  the
south  side  of  the  Roxbury  line, — '•  one  half  of  the  said  premises
being  in  the  present  actual  possession  of  y*  said  Samuel  Robinson
8
J^^l^"  "Tlie  use.  benefit  and  income  profit  and  improvements  of
one  moiety  or  full  Inili"  part  of  all  the  said  Iiousing.  T-aiids  and  other
jiromi-es"  were  reserved  to  himself  and  v.ife  during  tluir  n:itnr:d
lives,  and  the  condition  of  the  conveyance  was.  that  the  n:!"antr-e.  or
hi.s  heirs,  shonld.  within  the  space  of  twelve  montlis  after  ilio  lit^iths
of  the  grantors,  pay  to  '•  our  son.  ]Mr.  John  Ko'/iuson  Mini.-tfr  of
DiixborouLjh  or  his  heiis  the  Sum  of  One  llundrtjd  pounds,  and  to
our  Son  in  Law  C'apt.  Jonathan  GulI'Vi.r  ten  shillings,  haveing
given  him  a  Marriage  portion  with  his  \\  ife."
■  The  date  of  the  mariiage  of  Samuel  Robinson  has  not  yet  been
ascertained.  It  was  probably  in  IGGo.  His  wife,  the  mother
of  his  tliree  children,  was  IMary,  the  oldest  child  of  Ridiard  and
Faith  (Withiugton)  Uaker  of  Dorchester.  She  was  bai>ti7,ed  "2  (12)
1G40,  and  against  the  name  on  the  church  record  is  written  "  mar-

Aug-.  2'2,  1772  (the  commission  siLined  by  Governor  1  lutchinsou  is

At  the  outbreak  of  hostilities,  or  perhajis  earlier,  he  was  commis-
sioned Colonel,  and  at  once  took  an  active  part  in  the  recruiting  of
troops.  Fearing  an  invasion  of  Dorchester  ]>y  tlie  enemy,  his  family
were  hurried  from  their  home  a  few  days  after  the  Lexington  fight,
and  sought  refuge  in  Stoughton  under  the  hospitable  roof  of  Samuel
Tucker,  whose  wife  was  a  cousin  of  Mrs.  Robinson.  Here  the
youngest  child  of  the  family  was  born  a  few  weeks  later,  and  was
baptized  in  the  meeting-house  under  the  name  of  the  illustrious
comrnander-in-chief.  The  house  in  Dorcliester  became  the  recruit-
ing station  for  the  regiment,  and  the  temporary  residence  of  alarmed
families  from  the  '•  neck,"  who  occupied  it  until  the  return  of  its
proper  occupants  later  in  the  season.  ]\Ieantime  Colonel  Robinson
was  with  his  troops,  and  just  prior  to  the  evacuation  of  r>oston  by
the  English  army  in  Marcii,  1776,  was  stationed  on  Dorchester
Heights.  After  the  departure  of  the  enemy  he  was  quartered  in  the
city,  and  died  of  the  small-jtox  July  20,  177G,  being  buried  by  night
in  a  tomb  in  the  Granary  burying-ground.

THE  EOBIiS"SO^^  ESTATES.
Tavo  estates  in  Dorchester  were,  in  former  times,  identified  witli
the  history  of  our  Kc>'jinson  family.  Tiie  first  of  tliese  was  the
ancestral  home,  descending  in  the  male  line  until  about  the  close  of
the  last  century,  when,  in  the  division  of  the  inheritance,  it  passed
into  the  hands  of  femal-j  branches,  and,  eventually,  entirely  away
f)-om  the  family.  The  second  was  the  handsome  estate  that  fell  to
Colonel  Lemuel  Eobinsou  on  the  death  of  his  maternal  grandfather
in  17u2,  and  whicli,  after  a  century's  occupation  by  his  daughters
and  daughters'  heirs,  in  gradually  lessening  area,  has  passed,  also,
into  the  possession  of  strangers.
The  locations  of  both  these  estates  have  been  determined,  and  the
precise  boundaries  of  the  second  can  be  accurately  desci-ibed.
Where  our  emigrant,  William  Kobinson,  first  lived  after  his
arrival  in  Dorchester  in  or  before  1G3G,  and  befure  his  purchase  of
the  first  of  these  estates,  we  can  only  conjecture.  In  December,
16-15,  ''there  was  given  to  Edward  ])reck  (by  the  hands  of  most  of
the  ijihabitants  of  this  town)  smelt  brook  Crecke  one  the  Condicon
that  he  doe  set  a  mill  there."  It  is  certain  that  Breck  immediately
built  the  mill,  and  th:it  lie  sold  it  to  A\'illiam  Iiobins':»n.  The  stream
Called  variously  Smelt  Brook,  Salt  Creek,  and  Tide-mill  Creek,
flows  into  the  Xeponict  Hiver  from  its  west  bank  near  its  mouth,
separating  "Captain's  Xeok"  from  the  main  land,  its  source  being  near
what  is  now  Harrison  Square.  Breck's  mill  was  built  for  grinding
corn,  and  was  on  the  present  Mill  Street,  where  it  crosses  the  stream.
William  Bobinson  prubably  lived  in  the  ''little  house"  near  by,
which  he  sold  in  liJG-l  with  ten  acres  of  land  and  one  half  of  the
mill  t(j  Timothv  Tileston.     It  was  here  that  he  met  his  violent  death
43
a  few  years  later,  and  from  thence  liis  body  was  borne  aloni;-  the
"Lower  Road"  to  his  lionie,  a  mile  distant.  There  is  no  record  of
the  sale,  by  the  heirs,  of  his  reiualning  interest  in  the  mill.
On  Feb.  2r>,  1G51-2,  probably  wliile  living  in  the  "little  house"
near  the  n^ill,  our  ancestor  bought  of  John  Phillips  the  hitter's  im-
pro^■ed  estate  on  the  Lower  I\oad,  containing  in  area  about  thirty-two
acres.  Phillips  was  a  "biscuit  maker,"  or  baker,  who  had  been  long
prominent  in  town  alFairs,  and.  had  jiccunmlated  considerable  pro-
perty. He  had  removed  to  Boston  in  1650,  and  afterwards  became
one  of  the  founders  of,  and  a  deacon  of  the  Second  Church.  In
Clapp's  History  it  is  said  that  his  homestead  was  on  Leeds's  Lane,
now  Savin  Hill  Avenue,  but  the  records  show  that  he  was  a  large
holder  of  realty  in  other  parts  of  the  town  as  well.
The  house  lots  of  most  of  the  early  settlers  were  between  Mount
r>owdoin  and  Savin  Hill,  in  the  northerly  part  of  the  town,  but  the
allof-inents  to  freemen  gradually  extended  the  settlement  towards  the
Nvest  and  south.  In  1G33  Israel  Stoughton  was  given  right  to  erect
a  mill  on  the  Xcponsct  at  th.e  place  known  as  the  "lower  falls,"  and
the  next  year  the  selectmen  laid  out  a  "  cartway"  leading  to  the  [)lace.
This  was  perhaps  the  beginning  of  the  highway  which  was  im-
proved from  time  to  time,  known  soon  as  the  "country  road  from
Dorchester  to  Xeponset  mill,"  later  as  the  "Upper  Eoad,"  and  now
as  Washington  Street.  It  seems  to  have  been  formally  established
as  a  highway  in  1(361.  The  "field  called  the  Great  Lots"  began
"  a  little  south  of  ^Meeting  House  Hill,  and  extended  to  the
Neponset,"'^"  being  crossed  by  the  Upper  Road.f  "While  the
road  to  Stoughton's  mill  was  developing,  a  similar  operation  was
going  on  east  of  it,  a  road  to  "Pine  Xeck"  being  laid  out  in  1661,
followed  by  the   projection  of  another  through  the  "  Six  acre  lots  "

that  there  was  at  that  time  a  well  recoguLzed  "old  road"  between  Spurr's  Hill  and  the
Mill
44
ultimately  reaching   tlie  Xcpoiiset    at    the   mill,   known   first   as  the
''Lower  Eoad,"    and   now    as    Adams    Street.       For    many    years
these  two  avenues,   the  Upper  and  Lower   Koads,    were  the  only
thoronghtarcs  between  Boston   Xeck   and   the   bridge  at  Stougliton's
mill.      They  wound  around    the   bases  of  the   hills  and  avoided  the
gwam})s  in  unstudied   curves   that   liave    been   preserved   to  our  day.
The  large  area  enclosed  by  them    was   in   hill  and  dale,  meadow  and
marsh.      Here  were  the  Great  Lots,*   the  Six  and  Eight  acre  Lots,
and  the  Great  Ix)t  Ends.      Li  the  early  part  of   this  century,  adven-
turous   spirits,     seeking     more     direct     communication    with    their
neighbors  than  tlie  devious  Avindings  of  the  Upper  and  Lower  Ivoads
allowed,  projected  a  "turnpike,"  straight  as  the  arrow  flies,  bisecting
the  wide  area  between   the  ancient  highways,  striking  the  Neponset
bridge  at  the  joining  of  the  two.      Old  farms  were  cut  in  twain  and
cross  streets  took    the    place  of  the  old  lanes.      Later  the  turnpike
becauie  Dorchester  Avenue.      To-day  the  entire  area   is  divided  and
sub-divided  by   well   built  streets  lined  with  substantial  residences.
Within  this  territory  both  of  the   Robinson  farms  were  located,  and
both  are  now  crossed  by  the  railroad  tracks  of  the  Shawmut  branch.
Phillips,  while  a  resident  of  Dorchester,  had  been  busy  acquiring
real  estate.      In  1G35  it  was  ordered  in  town  meeting  that  he  should
have  "two  acres  of  land  that  lyes  betwixt  the  ends  of  the  great  lotts
and  three  acres  tliat  is   granted  to  Alexander  ^liller."     In  163G  he
was  granted  "six  acres  next  to  Goodman  ]\Iin<jt  and  Richard  Collicot
in  the  fresh  marsh."     In  1039  he  bought  of  Thomas  Hatch  "a  great
lott  Avith  a  howse  on  that  16  akers  "  with  other  land  besides,  and  in
1642  he  obtained  by  exchange  from  Christopher  Gibson  "the  end  of
his  great  lott that  lyeth  to  John  Phillips  great  lots  ends."
*  In  a  recent  letter  to  tlie  writer  from  Mr.  Daniel  W.  Baker  occur  the  following  lines
relating  to  the  Great  Lots,  Tliey  are  given  a  place  here  as  the  conclusions  of  a  careful
student  of  the  early  history  of  Dorchester.
"I  think  it  probable  that  the  tract  referred  to  in  the  town  records  as  the  'Great  Lots'
was  somewhat  ditfcrent  at  different  dates.  What  was  meant  for  town  record  purposes  was
such  tract  as  was  farmed  in  common  at  the  date  of  recurd,  being  enclosed  by  one  f'nt e,
which  fence  was  maintained  by  town  authority  (tlioughat  tl;e  land-owner's  expense)  while
in  this  state.  As  from  time  to"  time  individual  owners  assumed  the  respousibiiity  of  main-
taining euch  his  own  fence,  enclosmg  his  own  particular  lot,  the  town  authority  was  with-
drawn, but  was  still  exercised  over  other  tracts  which  had  been  cleared  from  forest  and  had
been  fenced  in  common."
45
All  of  these  acqiii^itious  were  in  the  region  that  has  been  mentioned.
The  propcrtv  that  lie  sold  to  ^VilliaIn  Kobinson  is  described  in  the
convevaiice  us  his  "dwelling  house  in  dorehester  neare  unto  Xapon-
sctt  lAiver,  with  all  outhouses,  barnes,  stables,  cowhouses,  yards,
gardens,  orchards,  and  all  other  Appurtenances  thereunto  in  any
wise  belonging  and  also  severall  parcells  of  laud  meadow  and  upland
hereafter  mentioned  and  cx[)ressed  that  is  to  say  one  parcell  of  land
or  fence  estimated  five  acres  bee  it  more  or  Icsse,  also  an  eight  acre
lott  he  hath  bought  of  William  lilake  of  Dorchester  lying  within
fence  and  also  fowerteenc  acres  of  meadow  adjoyning  unto  the  said
eight  acre  lot.  Also  fower  great  lott  ends  contayning  by  estimation
thirty  two  acres  be  they  more  or  less."  The  consideration  was  X150.
There  is  no  reason  to  doubt  that  this  estate  became  the  homestead  of
AVilliam  Kobinson,  and  that  a  portion  of  it,  at  least,  was  the  pro-
perty described  in  las  will  printed  in  full  on  a  previous  page,  and
given  therein  to  his  eldest  son  Samuel.  Subsequent  deeds  locate  it
as  west  and  north  of  the  Lower  Koad,  reaching  certainly  from  the
present  ]Minot  Street  to  some  distance  south  of  Codman  Street,  with  a
frontage  on  the  Lower  Road  near  the  junction  of  Codman  Street.  The
land  upon  the  opposite,  or  south  side  of  tiie  road  which  he  distinctly
tells  us  he  bought  of  John  Minot  and  others,  was  the  share  given  to
his  youngest  son  Increase,  and  v\ith  this  we  have  no  further  concern.
The  widow  Ursula  did  not  long  interfere  with  her  stepson's  exclu-
sive enjoyment  of  the  estate,  for  in  five  years  she  married  Grifiin
Crafts  and  went  to  lioxbury.
Samuel  Robinson  materially  added  to  his  domain,  purchasing  at
various  times  contiguous  pieces  towards  tlie  north  until  his  bounds
reached  to  the  south  line  of  the  Trutt  estate,  and  \vestward  until  he
had  acquired  a  frontage  on  the  Upper  Road.  lie  bought  also  on  the
south  side  of  the  Lower  Road  north  of  the  present  cemetery.  As  we
have  seen  he  disposed  of  his  estate  before  death,  providing  for  his
daughter  Gulliver  and  son  Jolm  out  of  his  personal  property,  and
o-ivinc:  the  realtv  to  the  elder  son  Samuel.
At  his  father's  death  in  1718,  his  mother  having  already  departed,
Samuel  Robinson,  Jr.,  entered  into  the  full  possession  of  the  estate.
46
As  oarlv  as  in  1707  he  had  commenced  the  purchase  of  land  adjoining
his  fatlier's,  and  in  1720  lie  bouglit  of  Joseph  Leeds  four  acres  in  tli3
"Six  Acre  Lors"  at  the  bend  in  the  Lower  ro.id  opposite  the  junc-
tion of  the  present  Marsh  Street  and  Ciranite  Avenue,  thereby  hu'gely
increasing  liis  frontage  upon  the  liiglnvay.  A  portion  of  this  hist
named  purchase  is  now  in  the  occupation  of  ]Mr.  F.  L.  Pierce.  At
his  death  in  173  i  ho  followed  tlic  example  of  his  father  and  grand-
fathui-,  and  instead  of  dividing  the  realty,  satisfied  the  claims  of  his
only  other  child  out  of  his  personal  estate,  and  left  the  house  and
hinds  to  his  sou  A\  illiam,  the  widow  being  amply  provided  for.
So  at  the  age  of  twenty-seven  ^^'illiam  Kobinson  became  the  owner
of  quite  an  extensive  and  valuable  domain,  there  being  in  the  aggre-
gate over  one  hundred  acres  of  orchard,  pasture  and  tilled  land
within  the  area  bounded  on  the  east  and  west  by  the  tvro  great  roads,
south  of  what  is  now  Beaumont  Street.  Here  he  lived  until  his
sudden  dcatli  in  17G1  at  the  age  of  fifty-four.  His  granddaughter
Dolbeare,  in  her  old  age,  told  the  writer's  brother  that  "he  had  no
occupation,  but  enjoyed  himself  in  riding  and  hunting."  AVith  his
death  the  hereditary  succession  to  the  estate  by  the  eldest  son  ceased,
and  it  was  divided  between  the  heirs,  consisting  of  the  widow, — the
eldest  son  Lemuel,  then  married  and  living  with  his  mother's  parents
on  the  Upper  Road, — Samuel,  wdio  married  six  months  later  and
lived  on  the  estate, — Ann,  then  wife  of  Samuel  Payson, — and
Jerusha,  Zibiah  and  Joseph,  minors.  ^Ir.  Payson  improved  his
wife's  portion  by  erecting  the  house  now  standing  at  the  corner  of
Codman  and  Carruth  Streets,  owned  by  ]Mr.  James  Pope,  where  he
lived  until  his  death.  Jcrusha's  portion,  now  bisected  by  Fredcrica
Street,  adjoined  the  Payson  on  the  east,  and  the  house  where  she  lived
with  her  son  "William  Melius  is  that  known  as  the  Glover  place.
The  widow  of  William  Robinson  married  Captain  Beale,  and  re-
moved to  Quincy.  Lemuel,  it  will  be  remembered,  died  during  the
War.  In  1785  his  portion  of  the  estate,  about  forty  acres,  probably
lying  south  of  the  present  Codman  Street,  was  purchased  by  his
son-in-law,  John  Mears.  After  the  widow  Beale's  death  in  1702,
the  distribution  of  the  remainder  of  the  estate  was  effected,  Xathn'--'-'
47
Blake  becoming  the  largest  purchaser.  Blake's  house  was  on
Adams  Street  a  few  rods  south  of  Codman.  Ilis  purchases  event-
ually includotl  all  the  frontage  on  the  west  and  north  of  Adams
Street  from  about  the  railroad  crossing  to,  or  beyond  ^Minot  Street,
including  the  shares  of  Mrs.  Melius  and  Samuel  Robinson.  In  1803
jNIr.  Blake  sold  the  lot  at  the  bend  of  Adams  Street  (now  the  F.  L.
Pierce  property)  to  Jonathan  and  Daniel  IMerce,  and  after  the  death
of  liis  widow  in  1808  (not  1803  as  incorrectly  printed  on  page  19)
the  heirs  disposed  of  the  remainder.
The  house  occupied  by  William^  Eobinson  before  his  death  in
17G1  is  known  to  have  been  on  the  west  side  of  Ailams  Street  in  the
vicinity  of  the  present  school-house.  ^Irs.  Dolbeare  said  that  her
father,  the  colonel,  ''pulled  down  the  old  house  where  his  fatlier  lived,
and  built  on  its  cellar  a  building  for  his  hired  men,  called  the  'bar-
racks.'" This  building  was  standing,  in  a  ruinous  condition,  within
the  memory  of  those  now  living.  There  is  some  evidence  that  the
house  occupied  by  the  earlier  generations  was  north  of  this,  and
reached  by  a  lane,  perhaps  where  New  Minot  Street  is.
The  other  Hobinson  Estate  was  upon  the  Upper  Road,  south  of
Ashmont  Street,  and  reaching  eastward  as  flxr  as  the  present  Carruth
Street.
Could  Thomas  Trott,  after  his  long  sleep  of  one  hundred  and
thirty  years  in  the  Dorchester  grave-yard,  assume  his  earthly  form
and  revisit  the  scenes  of  his  youth  and  old  age,  two  only  of  the  ancient
landmarks  would  greet  his  eyes,  marking  the  spot  where  his  life  was
spent.  Haifa  mile  south  of  the  old  town-hall,  on  the  easterly  side
of  Washington  Street,  can  be  seen  in  this  year  1800,  the  stone
walls  that  mark  the  entrance  on  either  side  to  '' Tolman's  lane."
Here  was  the  northerly  boundary  of  bis  farm.  Should  he  pass  to
the  rear  of  the  modern  house  that  covers  the  site  of  his  ancient
dwelling,  he  would  see  there,  in  the  old  door-yard,  the  huge  boulder
about  which  he  played  as  a  child,  and  which  neither  time  or  the
hand  of  man  has  altered.  All  else  is  changed.  Old  bounds  are
gone ;   a  street   divides   his   acres  from    west    to    east ;    the   "  turn-

pike"  crosses  them  diagonally  from  north  to  south;  railroad  trains
whiz  over  the  fields,  and  on  the  eastern  contincs  Carruth  Street,  with
its  line  of  pretty  residences,  occupies  his  meadows.
To  trace  the  prior  ownership  of  this  estate  which  he  left  to  his
grand.ion,  except  by  induction,  is  impossible.  Xo  map  of  the  earlv
grants  to  Dorchester  settlers  exists,  and  the  transfers  of  realtv  as
recorded  are  so  meagre  in  their  descriptions  that  but  few  can  be
recognized.  But  we  know  that  the  emigrant  Trott  was  the  owner
of  fifty  acres  in  the  Great  Lots,  and  that  when  the  Upper  Road  was
laid  out  the  Trott  farm  was  crossed  by  it,  a  portion  reraainino-  on
each  side.  AMit-n  the  settler  made  his  will  in  1()94  he  gave  to  the
young  grandchild  that  bore  his  name,  and  to  his  sister,  "sixteen
acres  of  land  which  lieth  about  their  fathers  hous  and  a  letle  hous
which  standeth  upon  it  wdiicli  they  live  in,  their  mother  relict  to  mv
son  Thomas  to  have  the  improvement  of  all  I  have  given  to  these
ray  to  gran  Children."  The  father  had  just  met  his  death  by  an
accident,  lleeords  are  silent  concerning  the  after  life  of  the  youno-
widow  and  the  little  girl.  Both  were  probably  dead  when  the  emi-
grant's widow,  Sarah,  then  aged  and  infirm,  made  her  will  in  1711.
We  cannot  reasonably  doubt  that  the  estate  thus  bequeatlied  to
Thomas,  3d,  was  the  same  on  which  he  lived,  and  where  he  died  in
1762.  By  contemporaneous  deeds  it  appears  that  adjoining  pro-
perty was  owned  by  the  younger  sons  of  the  emiorant,  nrobablv
their  shares  of  the  original  farm.
Early  in  life  our  Thomas  married  Zibiah,  the  daughter  of  Isaac
Royall,  a  near  neighbor,  and  the  owner  of  land  ou  the  same  side  of
the  Upper  Road.  Four  children  were  born  to  them,  one  of  whom
died  in  childhood.  The  eldest,  Lemuel,  graduated  at  Harvard  in
1730,  and  soon  after  died  abroad.  Zibiah,  the  older  of  the  tv.'o
girls,  man-ied  John  Crevath  and  went  to  Boston,  and  the  younger,
Ann,  married  our  William'  Robinson.  So  it  came  that  as  Thomas
Trott  and  his  wife  advanced  in  years  they  took  into  their  house  the
grandchild  Lemuel,  named  for  their  own  son,  and,  eventually,  made
him  their  heir.  He,  in  his  turn,  married,  and  brought  his  wife
home   to   aid    in  the   care  of  his  grandparents.      Their  wills  are  on
49
rcconl.  That  of  Thomas  Trolt,  dated  Xov.  24,  17G0,  gives  to  his
wife  the  improvement  of  the  estate  during  life  ;  to  his  daiigliters
Crevath  and  Robinson,  each  £06.  13.  4.  in  addition  to  what  he  had
alre;uly  : given  them;  to  grandson  Tliumas  Crevath  £133.  G.  8.,
with  reversion  to  the  other  Crevath  children,  Lemuel,  Zibiah,  Mary
and  Elizabetli ;  and  to  Lemuel  Rol)inson  all  the  rest  of  the  estate.
The  widow  Zibiah  made  her  will  March  8,  17t)4,  and  with  the  ex-
ception of  small  legacies  to  her  daughters,  left  all  that  she  had  to
the  favorite  grandson.  Of  the  life  and  fortunes  of  Lemuel  Robin-
son we  have  had  glimpses  on  a  previous  page.  His  share  of  his
father's  estate  on  the  Lower  Road,  added  to  the  Trott  inheritance,
made  him  a  large  proprietor,  and  as  the  land  was  all  in  tillage  it
was  necessary  to  employ  a  considerable  force  of  laborers  in  its  culti-
vation. To  acconnnodate  these  he  built  upon  the  site  of  his  father's
bouse,  the  building  called  "  the  barracks."  At  his  death  the  widow
was  left  with  eight  children,  the  oldest  scarcely  sixteen,  and  the
youngest  a  babe  in  arms.  Six  years  later  the  daughter  Ann  married
Nathaniel  Blake,  and  took,  as  her  portion  of  the  estate,  a  house  and
land  ou  the  Lower  Road  south  of  Codman  Street.  Five  years  after-
^Yards  Zibiah  married  John  Dolbeare,  and  went  to  live  with  him  on
the  adjoining  estate,  just  north  of  Tolman's  Lane,  v.hich  in  former
times  had  been  the  Royall  home.  In  1784  Thomas  Trott  Robinson,
the  oldest  son,  sold  to  John  Mears  the  house  and  about  two  acres
off  the  Bouth-west  corner  of  the  estate.  An  old  survey  of  the  lot
bought  by  ^Ir.  Mears  indicates  a  street  frontage  of  about  2o0  feet,
by  a  depth  of  400  feet,  the  house  being  close  to  its  north  line.  In
1817,  after  the  widow  Robinson's  death,  a  final  division  of  the  estate
was  made.  From  a  survey  made  by  T^Iather  "Withington  at  that
date  it  appears  that  the  home  farm  was  a  tract  Go 6  feet  in  width,
extending  from  the  "  Great  Road  "  on  the  west  to  lands  of  William
Tolman  and  the  AVithingtons  on  the  east,  that  is  to  say,  to  the  line
of  the  present  Carruth  Street.  On  the  north  it  was  bounded  nearly
its  entire  length  by  Tolman's  lane,  on  the  south  by  John  Mears
(nearest  the  Great  Road),  Samuel  TopliiT  and  Ichabod  Frost,  all
the  last  holding  under 'earlier  conveyances  from  the  Robinson  heirs,
7
50
iiidicatiug  a  greater  wielth  of  the  estate  at  a  previous  time.  Tlie
frontage  upon  the  Great  Uoad  -was  but  about  300  feet,  the  elbow
made  by  Tolinan's  I^ane  cutting  away  the  north-west  corner,  and
the  sale  to  Mears  in  1  Tj^i  having  made  inroads  at  the  soutli  west.
At  the  division  the  larger  portion  of  this  mapped  tract  passed  into
the  hands  of  the  younger  Jolui  ]Mears  (the  son  of  Sarah  Robinson
by  her  first  husband,  John  ^Nlears,  Sr.,  Avho  liad  died  in  1707),  and
until  a  conll>arati^L'Iy  h\te  day  his  descendants  liave  occupied  the  old
house  in  which  Thomas  and  Zebiah  Trott  lived  and  died.  A
modern  house  marks  the  site  of  the  ancient  one.  It  was  about  150
feet  from  the  street,  approaclud  by  a  swcc])ing  driveway  between
old  trees,  most  of  which  are  now  gone.  The  main  entrance  was  in
the  middle  of  the  front,  the  rooms  on  either  side,  and  a  deep  L
reaching  back  in  tlie  rear.  It  had  been  built  in  sections,  the  north-
erly one  being  very  old, — "two  hundred  years," — it  is  said.  It
seems  probable  that  t!)is  was  tlie  original  Trott  house,  the  newer
portion  having  been  built,  perhaps  after  the  death  of  the  aged  widow
Sarah,  by  Thomas  the  third.  The  barn  was  near  Tohnan's  lane,
north-east  of  tlie  house.  In  it  were  stored  the  field-pieces  smuggled
out  of  Boston  under  the  noses  of  tlie  Briti>]i  sentries  in  the  early
days  of  the  occupation.  It  was  taken  down  by  ]Mr.  Mears,  and  the
barn  of  the  present  day,  in  tlie  rear  of  the  house,  is  the  one  built  by
him  to  take  its  place.
South  of  the  })roperty  bouglit  by  ]Mea)'s  in  1784,  on  what  was
Kobinson  land  at  Col.  Lemuel's  death,  there  was  to  be  seen  as  late
as  1845  an  old  cellar,  wiiich,  it  was  said  by  ]Mrs.  Dolbeare,  was  that
of  an  older  Trott  liouse.  l\n-haps  it  was  all  that  was  left  of  the
little  house  mentioned  in  the  will  of  Thomas  Trott,  senior,  as  the
home  of  his  grandchildren.
It  will  be  remembered  that  Col.  Robinson's  daughter  Zibiah  mar-
ried John  Dolbeare  and  occupied  the  place  on  ^Vashington  Street
north  of  Tohnan's  lane.  Here,  for  many  years  preceding  her
death  in  1855,  she  and  her  widowed  sister,  Mrs.  Spear,  lived  to-
e;ether,  tlie  last  of  their  o-eneration.  Tohnan's  lane  extended  from
the  Upper  to  the  Lower  Road,  but  not  in  a  straight  line.  All  but
its  western  end  is  now  in  public  use  as  Ashmont  Street.      Thomas
51
Tolraan,  whose  will  was  made  in  1711,  lived  in  a  house  on  the
northerlv  side  ofthehine,  midway  between  AA'a^hinuton  Street  and
Dorchester  Avenue,  I^aac  Ri)yall,*  the  carpenter,  owning  hmd  west
of  him,  se[)aratin2:  the  Tohnan  pr()[)orty  Irom  the  street.  Samuel
Jones  ^^■as  his  neighhur  on  t!ie  north,  and  the  I'rott  tarm  adjoined
hini  on  the  south.  Tolman's  liouse-lot  and  j)asture  reaeiied  east-
ward nearly  to  Dorchester  Avenue,  the  house  ot  iiis  son  Daniel
standing  at  what  is  now  the  corner  of  Ashniont  Street  and  the
Avenue.  Directly  ea.>t  of  Daniel's  house-lot  was  a  tract  reaching
through  to  the  Lovrer  lioad,  bequeathed  by  the  will  of  Thomas  to
his  son  Daniel.  0\er  the  southern  line  of  this  })ro{icrty  the  lane
was  in  use  at  an  earlv  date  for  access  to  the  ln)uses  of  Thomas  ;ind
Daniel.  In  1700  Thomas  Pearce,  Sr.,  owned  a  small  lot  of  an
acre  and  a  quarter  with  a  frontage  of  about  200  feet  on  the  Up[)er
Koad,  preventing  the  continuation  of  the  lane  to  that  thoroughfare.
Pearce  sold  to  l-aac  Poyall,  Jr.,  and  the  lane,  jiroljably  by  an
arrangement  with  the  Trotts,  was  turned  at  right  angles  towards  the
south,  and,  again,  at  a  distance  of  200  feet,  towards  the  west,
reaching  the  road  between  the  Koyall  and  Trott  properties.  It  is
this  end  of  the  lane,  with  its  right-angled  elbow,  that  is  still  pre-
served, the  stone  walls  that  bound  it  serving  to  conspicuously  mark
its  location.
About  the  same  tirjie  (1706)  that  the  younger  Royall  bought
the  Pearce  lot,  he  bought  of  John  Plum  a  square  lot  of  one
acre  immediately  adjoining  it  on  the  north.  Isaac  Koyall,  the
father,  owned  the  land  north  and  east  of  the  Plum  lot.  On  this  lot
Isaac  lived  utiril  his  removal  to  St(.)Ughton  in  172(>,  then  selling  his
house  lot  to  Thomas  \Vhite.  In  the  hou^e  in  v>]iich  he  lived,  Mr.
Dolbeare  and  his  wife    lived    and  died.      Isaac  lu^vall,  Sr.,  died   in
1720,  having  previously  conveyed  to  his  son  Robert  the  house  and
lands  north,  and  west  of  the  son  Isaac's.  Here  Kobert  lived,  and
died  in  175G,  leaving  but  one  child  Josejih,   who  was  born  May  13,
1721.  This    Joseph  early   went  to  Antigua,  and  became  the  man-
•  The  fir-t  wife  of  Isaac  Royal!,  Sr.,  was  Ruth,  th-^  daughter  of  Thomas  Tolnian,  Sr.,
and  si-ter  of  the  Thomas  Toiman  of  Tohiiaii's  h\ne.  Tht-re  is  uo  reeoid  of  purchase  of  the
estate  on  the  U|)[  er  Road  by  Rfivall,  and  its  proximity  to  the  Toiman  lands  makes  it  possi-
ble that  he  received  it  with  liis  wife,  as  a  part  of  her  dowry.
ager  of  the  extensive  estates  there  of  liis  relative,  tlie  lion.  Isaac
lioyall.  From  the  West  Indies  he  went  to  London,  and  died  there
June  3,  1814,  in  Great  Cumberland  Street,  aged  03.  There  is  no
evidence  that  he  ever  returned  to  this  coiuitrv.  His  mother  lived  a
widow  on  the  homestead  until  1773,  and  during  her  life  he  carefullv
provided  for  her  comfort  through  the  agency  of  friends  in  the  neigh-
borhood. How  his  estate  e&<-'apcd  confiscation  it  is  not  easy  to  see.
He  was  an  uin'ompromising  Tory,  and  in  IIS'2  gave  his  Dorcliester
realty  to  his  distant  cousin  Penelope  Vassall,  herself  of  Toi-y  strain,
rather  than  to  his  nearer  relatives  of  different  political  leanings.
Fii'ty  years  ago  he  was  remembered  in  the  older  generation  as
"English  lloyall."     It  is  believed  that  he  never  married.
The  widow  Penelope  Vassall  was  the  only  daughter  of  an  older
Isaac  Royall,  and  sister  of  the  Hon.  Isaac,  the  refugee,  in  whose
service  Joseph  Royall  had  gone  to  tlie  A\'est  Indies.*  Her  husband
was  Henry  Vassall  of  Cambridge,  the  owrscr  of  extensive  planta-
tions in  Antigua,  who  died  ]\Iarch  17,  17G9.  There  is  ample  evi-
dence that,  through  political  and  other  causes,  her  aflhirs  were  in  a
greatly  embarrassed  condition  after  the  Revolution.  In  her  strait-
ened circumstances  she  sold  the  Royall  lands  by  parcels.  Ezra
Badlam,  Feb.  20,  17^3,  bought  from  her  five  acres  of  pasture  land,
bounded  east  by  the  heirs  of  Lemuel  Robinson  and  by  Joseph  How,
and  west  by  the  Upper  Road.  On  ^lay  15,  1784,  Stephen  Badlam
bought  from  her  nine  acres  of  pasture  adjoining  E^ra  Badlam's  pur-
chase, and  north  of  it.  Both  of  these  properties  were  soutli  of  the
Trott  farm.  August  10,  1784,  Desire  Tolman  bought  from  her  the-
homestead,  eonsi.-ting  of  throe  and  a  half  acres,  with  the  liouse,.
bounded  north  on  Ebenezer  Jones,  east  on  lands  of  Aquila  Tol-
man deceased,  south  on  the  Tohnan  lands  and  Benjamin  Dolbeare
(the  old  John  Plum  lot),  and  west  on  the  Upper  Road.  "With  this-
last  was  included  tlie  barn  and  orchard  lot  on  the  opposite  side  of
the  road.  The  old  Royall  homestead  afterwards  was  known  as  tht^
"Dorr  place."

PORTION  OF  DIARY  OF  WILLIAM^  ROBINSON  (13).*
"Shipped  as  maiu-topman  on  board  the  private  armed  ship  Franklin,
Josepli  Robinson,  Commander,  for  a  four  mouths  cruise,  iu  September  1779.
Cruised  off  Newfoundland,  took  one  Prize,  thence  to  the  Bahama  Islands,
meeting  with  no  success;  then  went  off  Sandy  Hook,  and  cruised  until  some-
time in  December,  took  three  or  four  prizes,  returned  to  Salem,  where  the
sliiji  was  frozen  up  till  the  month  of  ^larch  in  that  terrible  winter  of  17S0.
''  In  March  entered  on  board  the  ship  Pilgrim  of  Beverly,  Joseph  Robin-
son, Commander.  Cruised  ofi'  New  York  till  the  last  of  June,  took  five  or
six  prizes,  put  into  Newport  twice  to  land  prisoners,  the  vessels  we  had
taken,  being  armed,  had  a  large  complement  of  men;  landed  from  seventy
to  eighty  each  time;  last  time  we  returned  to  Beverly,  where  the  ship  was
refitted,  and  I  shipped  again  for  a  six  months  cruise.
"Sailed  in  July,  cruised  off  Cape  Clear,  on  the  coast  of  Ireland,  and  in
the  chops  of  the  English  Channel,  last  of  November  or  first  of  December,

that  he  wuiild  use  his  intliience  to  have  an  equal  number  of  Americans
exchanged,  that  he  would  not  serve  until  he  was  exchanged.  I  understood
afterwards  that  he  fulfilled  his  word,  and  that  Captain  Maidey  was  exchanged
for  Captain  Smith.  We  then  put  into  IJrest  with  a  Prize  Brig  loaded  with
sugar,  refitted  and  coppered  the  ship  and  sailed.  Arrived  home  the  last  of

After  refitting  and  manning  the  ship,  sailed  for  Marblehead  in  December
1781,  where  we  went  to  make  up  our  complement  of  men.
''Cruised  to  windward  of  Barbadoes,  took  several  Prizes,  one  of  which
was  the  Prince  William  Henry,  Packet  from  Falmouth  for  Barbadoes

"  Cruised  sometime  oft  the  coast  of  Nova  Scotia.  Took  a  ship  from  the
West  Imlies  bound  to  Halifax,  returned  to  Beverly  with  our  Prize.  Some-
time in  September  1782,  after  refitting,  we  proceeded  to  Portsmouth  where
we  shipped  men  suflicient  to  make  up  our  crew.  The  next  morning  after
