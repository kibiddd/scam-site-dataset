Eating Raoul
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Eating Raoul serves up its spectacularly lurid tale with a healthy heaping of pitch-black humor and anarchic vigor.

Paul Bartel's Eating Raoul is about lurid sex, murder, cannibalism and greed. It's also the best comedy of the fall season.

Chicago Sun-Times
Problem is, it's so laid-back it eventually gets monotonous. If the style and pacing had been as outrageous as the subject matter, we might have had something really amazing here.

Made on a non-existent budget, here is a kick right in Hollywood's bloated butt.

Film Threat
Nicely lays out capitalism on the chopping block. In an obsessively consumptive culture like America's, the only way for a common couple to strive is through killing, then consuming.
Rated: 4/5

Q Network Film Desk
Despite the consistency of the film's droll take on murder and mayhem, it still feels oddly uneven and skimpy, as if there just isn't quite enough meat on its narrative bones.

For me eating Raoul is a film that i do not think i would watch again i guess it was not much to my liking because there was a lot of weird scenes in the film and I didn't really like that idea of how the couple was going out and about to kill other people just for there money. I think there is just a lot of scenes that could be disturbing for some people as well. I would not recommend this film to people that dont like watching things with murder in it. If you like dark humor or sort of like horror movies then i think that yes this would a film that you would find funny considering that it is a comedy like film.

Eating Raoul is a dark comedy. It mixes crime, satire, and odd humor. The story follows a conservative married couple who's dream is opening a restaurant but struggle with money. They accidently kill a swinger and realize they can profit by luring and murdering wealthy perverts. Things become complicated when Raoul joins their scheme. This film is funny but also weird. The couple is very serious which is what makes what they do so much funnier. The movie makes fun of the swinger lifestyle as well as the couples strict morals. It does have a low budget look to it but the story and style is very unique, its what made it a cult classic.

I feel like the plot of this movie was so good and they could’ve done so much with it but I felt like the storytelling was not as seamless as it could’ve been. With that being said this movie was hilarious! I did not expect to like this film so much. I love dark comedy so this was definitely up my alley. When the couple got into different bed cuddling with stuffed animals I laughed out loud. If you like dark comedy and satire you will love this film! I feel like the symbolism was not portrayed that well and I couldn’t see how this film could be taken further. But, as just a comedy it was good! I wouldn’t say this film is life changing but it was definitely entertaining and a fun watch!

This movie Eating Raoul is definitely not the best movie I have watched. I would say this movie is trying to be a dark comedy if that make sense. I see the vision but it just feels unreal. The movie covers a couple that hates the nasty people around them. This movie felt slow to be honest. I can say this move has a plot that sum cult films lack of. It just feels like an awkward movie. There is murderers and perverts apart of this movie but honestly everyone is bad. The jokes drag a little to much some can just rest, but nope not in this film. This isn't a film I would recommend to someone just because it just isn't worth it. It is overall weird and has many part of the movie I would just skip.

Obviously, Eating Raoul is not to be taken seriously and, if you like it, the film is worth a rewind and re-watch. But not with the same entertainment value as, say, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Come to think of it, the best way Eating Raoul could have benefited was to make it into a musical. Who woulda thunk it?

Eating Raoul was directed by and stared Paul Bartel in 1982. This movie is about Paul and Mary, who are a sexually repressed married couple that are surrounded by sexual deviants. They are trying to save money to open up a restaurant. The couple decides to lure men with a sexual fetish into their home so Paul can kill them with a frying pan and steal their money.
Raoul comes into the picture and becomes part of their team by getting rid of the dead bodies. Mary ends up killing Raoul and he becomes their dinner. This is a cult classic for a reason. On the one hand you have this couple that act like up standing citizens, but behind closed doors they are killing people. It may not sound like a comedy, but it is truly funny. I was actually surprised that they ate Raoul at the end, even knowing the title of the film.
The acting, lighting and pace of the movie was pretty good.
