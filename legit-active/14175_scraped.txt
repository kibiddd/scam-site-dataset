Share on WhatsApp The submission list for the 83rd Annual Academy Awards‘ foreign-language category has been finalized, with 65 countries having now announced their selections. The selection includes high profile entries on this year’s festival circuit, including Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Biutiful” (Mexico), Xavier Beauvois’s “Of Gods and Men” (France), Apichatpong Weerathesakul’s “Uncle Boonmee Can Recall His Past Lives” (Thailand), Susanne Bier’s “In a Better World” (Denmark) Denis Villeneuve’s “Incendies” (Canada), and Oliver Schmitz’s “Life, Above All” (South Africa).
indieWIRE had taken a look at the unofficial version of the list a few weeks back, noting Italy’s dismissal of Luca Guadagnino’s “I Am Love” as perhaps the most controversial exclusion from the submission list.

Though its the same amount of films as last year, there are some notable differences.  Armenia, Australia, Bolivia, Morocco, Sri Lanka and the UK all participated last year but did not submit this year. Countries submitting in their place included first timers Greenland, for “Nuummioq,” a film indieWIRE profiled last week. It was the very first feature film produced by the country, and Ethiopia, with “The Athlete,” directed by Davey Frankel and Rasselas Lakew.
Last year, the category ended up being won by Juan José Campanella’s “The Secret In Their Eyes,” from Argentina. This year that country submitted “Carancho,” directed by Pablo Trapero.
