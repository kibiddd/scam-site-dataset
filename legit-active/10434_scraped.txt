Here's how you can equip yourself for successful salary negotiations in your career.
It's amazing how often this one is overlooked.  Timing is everything and important in any type of negotiation.  Going in RIGHT after a moment of success might be too much but within that window of success is important.

Brandon Reinkensmeyer
‚ÄúPaul and his team at Core3 are a solid group of creative and knowledgeable IT/Web specialists. Although our group ultimately did not go through with the project due to internal budget constraints, I was extremely impressed with the follow-up, organization, and level of detail at Core3. Their custom packages, willingness to provide answers/explanations, and friendly personalities were great to work with and made our group very comfortable throughout the investigative process. I hope at some point down the road we can work with Core3 and/or utilize their extensive list of IT/Web based services.‚Äù
Scott Newman-Bale
‚ÄúExcellent service as always from Paul and everyone at Core 3. Thanks for the continued support in making my business ventures IT solutions happen.‚Äù
