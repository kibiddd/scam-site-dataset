CONCACAF Gold Cup
The CONCACAF Gold Cup (Spanish: Copa de Oro de la CONCACAF) (French: Coupe D'or du CONCACAF) is the main association football competition of the men's national football teams governed by CONCACAF, determining the regional champion of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.
The Gold Cup is held every two years. Prior to 2015, when the Gold Cup did not fall on the same year as the FIFA Confederations Cup, the winner, or highest placed team that is a member of both CONCACAF and FIFA, qualified for the next staging of that tournament. Beginning in 2015, the winners of two successive Gold Cups (the 2013 and 2015 editions in the first instance) will face each other in a playoff to determine the CONCACAF entrant to the next Confederations Cup. If the same team has won the Gold Cup on both relevant occasions, there will be no playoff and that team will automatically qualify for the Confederations Cup.

2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup
The 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the fifth edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), and the 15th overall CONCACAF tournament. It was held in the United States, in Los Angeles, Miami, and San Diego. The format of the tournament changed from 1998; it was expanded to twelve teams, split into four groups of three. The top two teams in each group would advance to the quarterfinals. Peru and Colombia were invited from CONMEBOL, and the Republic of Korea were invited from AFC.
With all three games in Group D ending in ties and Canada tied with the Republic of Korea on every tiebreaker, a coin toss was used. Canada won and advanced to the quarter-finals. They went on to win the championship, upsetting defending champions Mexico in golden goal extra time 2‚Äì1. They defeated Trinidad and Tobago in the semi-finals 1‚Äì0 after Craig Forrest saved a first-half penalty, and, already assured as CONCACAF champions, topped invitees Colombia 2‚Äì0 in the final.

2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup
The 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the 13th edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup competition and the 23rd CONCACAF regional championship overall in the organization's fifty-four years of existence. It was held in the United States, with two matches being played in Canada, marking the first time the CONCACAF Gold Cup was played in that country.
Mexico won the competition, defeating Jamaica ‚Äì the first Caribbean nation to reach such a stage ‚Äì in the final, after surviving both the quarterfinals and semifinals in controversial manner.
Of the co-hosts, Canada was eliminated in the group stage, while the United States, the defending champions, lost in the semifinals to Jamaica. The competition included a third place match for the first time since 2003, in which Panama defeated the United States.
Qualification for other tournaments
The 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup was used for qualification for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, to be played in Russia, and the Copa Am√©rica Centenario, to be played in the United States in 2016.

2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup
The 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the eighth edition of the Gold Cup, the football championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF). It was contested in the United States in July 2005. The United States emerged victorious in the final against an upstart Panama team led by tournament MVP Luis Tejada. After regulation and 30 minutes of extra time ended scoreless, the USA won 3-1 on penalties.
For this edition, the format was switched from four groups of three teams each to the three groups of four teams. As a result, there was one more group stage game for each team, and the likelihood of teams advancing on a coin toss was much less. The top two teams from each group and the two best third-place teams would advance to the quarterfinals.
As usual for the Gold Cup, several of the top teams fielded less than their top squads, including guest teams Colombia and South Africa. Mexico and the United States were missing at least half their usual starters, and a few top name players on smaller nations (Paulo Wanchope and Amado Guevara, among others) also declined to participate. During the tournament, matches in Miami's Group A had to be postponed because of Hurricane Dennis.

2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup
The 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the ninth edition of the Gold Cup, the football championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), and was won by the United States over Mexico. It was contested in the United States from 6 June to 24 June 2007.
This competition was the third tournament without guests from other confederations. As the winner, the United States represented CONCACAF at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.

The twelve teams that qualified were divided into three groups. The top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage along with the best two of the third-place teams, filling out the knockout field of eight.
If teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:
Head to head matches between the tied teams (if applicable)
Greatest goal difference in group matches
Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches

2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup
The 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the 11th edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup competition and 21st CONCACAF regional championship overall in CONCACAF's fifty years of existence. The United States was the host nation.
The competition started on June 5, 2011 at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, and ended with the final on June 25, 2011 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, with Mexico beating the United States 4-2.
This competition was the fifth tournament without guests from other confederations. Mexico won their sixth Gold Cup, and ninth CONCACAF Championship overall. It was the third consecutive Gold Cup final and second consecutive win also.
As winner of the tournament, Mexico qualified for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil as the representative from CONCACAF.
Participating nations
Venues
The set of thirteen venues ‚Äì the same number as the 2009 Gold Cup ‚Äì was announced on December 16, 2010. Each stadium hosted a doubleheader, except the Rose Bowl which hosted the final.

CONCACAF Gold Cup
The CONCACAF Gold Cup (Spanish: Copa de Oro de la CONCACAF) (French: Coupe D'or du CONCACAF) is the main association football competition of the men's national football teams governed by CONCACAF, determining the regional champion of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.
The Gold Cup is held every two years. Prior to 2015, when the Gold Cup did not fall on the same year as the FIFA Confederations Cup, the winner, or highest placed team that is a member of both CONCACAF and FIFA, qualified for the next staging of that tournament. Beginning in 2015, the winners of two successive Gold Cups (the 2013 and 2015 editions in the first instance) will face each other in a playoff to determine the CONCACAF entrant to the next Confederations Cup. If the same team has won the Gold Cup on both relevant occasions, there will be no playoff and that team will automatically qualify for the Confederations Cup.
