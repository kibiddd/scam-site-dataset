David Cone Perfect Game Box Score
David Cone was simply perfect on a day when perfection was in attendance. The original battery of the 1956 World Series perfect game were on hand as it was Yogi Berra Day in Yankee Stadium. Batterymate Don Larsen was on hand to throw out the first pitch of the game and Cone provided the fireworks for Berra, Larsen, and Yankees fans.
"You probably have a better chance of winning the lottery than this happening, but what an honor." - David Cone

Audio Moment
Cone's Final Out
Did you know that David Cone finished the game with eighty-eight pitches and sixty-eight of them were strikes?
How did the twenty-seven Montreal Expos batters go down? Thirteen fly outs, ten strikeouts and four groundouts.
At the end of the game, David Cone said, "The last three innings, that's when you really think about it. You can't help feel the emotion of the crowd. I can feel my heart thumping through my uniform."
Where what happened yesterday is being preserved today.
