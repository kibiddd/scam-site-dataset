JANUARY-JUNE 1894
January 4, 1894
JAMES KAY born Culpepper County, Virginia, November 1, 1816; in youth moved to Tennessee and there married Eliza Bailey of Dover, Tennessee, March 3, 1836; moved to St. Joseph, Missouri in May 1851 where he died November 11, 1893; active Methodist layman.
Reverend HENRY KAY, son of James and Eliza Kay, born in Dover, Tennessee, February 27, 1840; moved to St. Joseph, Missouri in May 1851; entered the Methodist ministry in 1860; served in Louisville Conference; health gradually impaired; he died November 10, 1893.
ROBERT S. THOMPSON born Prince Edward County, Virginia, November 24, 1832; died December 5 1893; son of the Rev. John Thompson, a Methodist preacher; moved when young with family to Fayette County, Tennessee and in 1856 moved to pine Bluff, Ark. where he married Belle Williams of Tennessee; had an only child, a son. An interesting touch in his obituary reads:
As a Christian Brother Thompson was true and loyal, and always in his place, and ready for the discharge of duty. His faith suffered no changes. "Forward to the home of the good" was his motto. This writer enjoyed a long and intimate association with him, and knew him for his worth. Standing with him in Lincoln Park, at the World's Fair, admiring the beauties of flower gardens, I asked him if the sight did not make him picture heaven in his mind, he replied: "I cannot imagine how heaven looks, but I intend by the good Lord's help to go and see." With such grand resolve and purpose dominating his life are we not justified in asking may he not in the last supreme moment have been permitted a glimpse of the beauties and glories of the goodly land, and that, as with his last breath bringing his hands together, he said, "Praise the Lord!" he was allowed to enter in? Bless God for the Christian's hope. In closing this feeble tribute to his memory, we realize the loss of a, friend so true, yet in our sorrow we feel a mighty sense of gratitude for his life and its influence for good.

In Memoriam: MARY CAROLINE SEVIER.
Mrs. Mary Caroline Sevier was born in Roane County, Tenn., February 27, 1810; and died near the place of her birth January 24, 1893. She was the only daughter of Major Thomas Brown, a native of North Carolina, and both a civil and a military officer of the United States. Major Brown was a man of affairs, the close personal friend of such eminent Tennesseans as Hugh L. White, Andrew Jackson, John Williams, and others. Having accumulated a large property, he gave to his daughter, for whom he cherished a very tender love, the best educational advantages that those times afforded, sending her first to Rittenhouse Academy, and then to Nashville. She made good use of her opportunities, and "stored a very active and retentive memory with the liberal sciences, history, and the elegancies of literature." While at Nashville she was the welcome guest of the Childresses, Cheathams, Grundys, Ewings, and prominent families, with many of whom she corresponded till late in life.
At the age of seventeen she was married to Mr. Elbridge Gerry Sevier, and removed to his farm on Nolachucky river, in Washington County. This connection largely extended the circle of her friends. Like the true wife that she was, she learned to love her husband's people as dearly as her own. During her residence on the Nolachucky, which lasted for a number of years, she united with the Methodist Church, in which her husband's able and eloquent brother, Rev. E. F. Sevier, had become a minister. Entering thus early upon the Christian life, she remained steadfast to the end of her pilgrimage. Reading her Bible every day, and trusting in the mercy and power of God, she kept her eye fixed on invisible things. It was her natural disposition to be kind and helpful as far as she was able. She did not limit her benefactions to any class or color. Her love for her own was intense and even passionate. Day and night she strove to make them comfortable and happy. Industrial, social, kind-hearted, she filled well her place in life. The record that she has left behind does not show a blotted page.
A widow for twenty-five years, she never lacked affectionate attention. Her children, one and all, reverenced and loved her. Whatever could be done to smooth the way for her aged feet was done. Her last sickness was full of pain, but she did not murmur nor complain. When she reached the valley of the shadow of death she called her children about her, told them that she was going home, and asked them not to weep for her. She is at rest with her Lord. The long journey of four score and three years has ended in perfect peace. Her mortal remains were buried by the side of her loved ones in her own yard. The roses and lilies that she planted with her own hands will make the air fragrant over her grave-but not more fragrant than the memory of her sweet and beautiful life in the hearts of her children and friends.

E. W. PACKARD
E. W. PACKARD was born at Georgeville, Stanstead County, in the Province of Quebec, Lower Canada, September 4, 1810, and fell asleep in Jesus at the home of his daughter, Mrs. M. E. Wells, Monticello, Ark., February 23, 1894. In 1638, Rev. Samuel Packard, wife and child, emigrated from England in the ship "Ipswich," as one of the Puritans who landed at Plymouth Rock, Mass. He finally settled at Old Bridgewater, Mass., where he was appointed a civil officer under the Government of England. He had four sons-Samuel, Zaccheus, John, and Nathaniel-all of whom in King Philip's War, and assisted in the capture of this celebrated chief in 1675. One of these four son's sons was the great-grandfather of the subject of this memoir, and his name was Daniel Packard. Daniel had five sons-Isaiah, Eleazer, Daniel, and Richard-Richard being the father of E. W. Packard. Richard Packard was a Revolutionary soldier who, by accident, settled too far north in Vermont, thus becoming after the war a taxpayer to the British crown, when the line was definitely fixed between the United States and Canada; but he and his brothers were pensioned by the United States Government till their death. He was united in marriage to Miss. Sally Coats, the orphan daughter of a captain. He and his young wife were both converted under the preaching of Whitefield in one of his tours through New England. To their union were born eight sons and six daughters. These sons were John, Daniel, Moses, Hollis, Chester, Wales, and Erastus--the last named being the seventh son, one of the sons dying in infancy. After finishing his education at Georgeville, Erastus W. Packard attended a French school at Montreal and became very proficient in the French language. He went to Georgia for his health when a young man, in about 1834, and for ten years engaged in teaching, making a specialty of French, which was a very popular language with the Southern aristocracy in those times. He taught for ten years or more in Putnam County, Phoenix Academy, and at Edenton in Meriwether County. He was a successful teacher. W. A. Wilson, one of his pupils more than fifty years ago, paid, the following tribute to him in the Atlanta Constitution, five years ago: "Mr.
(Page 11)
Packard, my first teacher, has been to me all my life the ideal of a Christian gentleman. Five years of my school-day life were spent under his tuition. In all that time, with the keenest intuitions of childhood all awake and watchful, I was never tempted to call in question his sincerity, or to harbor the least doubt of his truthfulness; and if he is really today what my memory paints him, then he is truly a model of what a man should be." While teaching in Georgia he was happily married to Miss. Rush L. Russell, the daughter of Rev. Burwell Russell, an Itinerant Methodist preacher and a lineal descendant of Lord John Russell. The fruit of this union was five children, three sons and two daughters, in order of their birth as follows: Clara O., Erastus E., Martha E., Burwell R., and Wilbur F. The last-named, and youngest, is a member of the Missouri Conference, M. E. Church, South and stationed at Fulton Mo. Prof. B. R. Packard is teaching at Ennis, Tex., and the rest of the children live in Arkansas.
