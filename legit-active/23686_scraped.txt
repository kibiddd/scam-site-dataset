Form Confirmation Orders for Subchapter V (SBRA) Plans (March 5, 2025)
In order to promote efficiency and consistency in practice across our district, the court has promulgated the below confirmation orders (hyperlinks) for use in cases under Subchapter V of Chapter 11. Each of the orders deals with a different confirmation scenario:
(1) Individual Debtor/Consensual Confirmation;
(2) Individual Debtor/Non-Consensual Confirmation;
(3) Corporate Debtor/Consensual Confirmation; and
(4) Corporate Debtor/Non-Consensual Confirmation.
There are two major points of distinction between the orders: (i) whether confirmation is consensual (11 U.S.C. § 1191(a)) or non-consensual (11 U.S.C. § 1191(b)); and (ii) discharge, the timing and scope of which depend upon whether the reorganized debtor is an individual or a corporate entity and whether plan confirmation is consensual or non-consensual.
Please understand that these orders are a starting point. As early as practicable in any given case, we encourage you to address with your presiding judge what changes they – or you – might wish to make to these orders when the time comes. We also encourage brevity and simplicity.
As always, we thank you for your hard work and professionalism.
