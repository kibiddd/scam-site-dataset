There is no better way to experience Canada
than by train. Discover destinations that appeal to urban
explorers, nature enthusiasts, and everyone in-between as you visit
the nation's most popular locales.
On the West Coast, Vancouver delights with its amazing amenities
and proximity to both the mountains and the ocean. Admire the
awe-inspiring beauty of the Canadian Rockies, where its alpine
towns seamlessly collide with its acclaimed National Parks, Jasper
and Banff. Continuing east, the cosmopolitan appeal of Toronto and
Ottawa is undeniable. Montreal often hailed for its culture and
cuisine, is another favorite of travelers. The natural wonders of
the Maritimes, including Halifax's Lunenburg and Mahone Bay, offer
a glimpse at what makes Canada's eastern seaboard so special.
Some Canada rail tours include overnight journeys aboard premier
sleeper trains, such as VIA Rail's Canadian train. This train
departs both from Vancouver and from Toronto and puts some of
Canada's most wondrous scenery on display as you travel across
Canada. Other tours utilize the Rocky Mountaineer, an all-daylight
luxury train that delves deep into parts of the country that are
inaccessible by any other mode of transportation. From your cozy
seat in SilverLeaf Service or GoldLeaf Deluxe, marvel at Canada's
most magnificent mountain range as you travel between Vancouver and
Jasper or Banff. Both include comfortable onboard accommodations
and delicious meals as you travel to the country's must-see
destinations.
With more than 100 Canada vacation packages featuring Canadian
railways, your choices can include rail trips through the Canadian
Rockies,  across Canada rail adventures, and
rail-cruise combination packages.
