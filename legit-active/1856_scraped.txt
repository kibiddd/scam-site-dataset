NOTES:
This "Lew" Fonseca JC Higgins,
"Spear-M" first baseman's mitt, was
made of select grain cowhide, fully
oiled front and back, tough flexible
leather, with leather bound edges.
Model 1679 for right handed throwers,
1641 for lefties.  Lew Fonseca a
life time 316 hitter played from
1921-1933, and was the AL Batting
champion in 1929 with a .369 batting
average. Fonseca is perhaps best known
as one of the first men to use film in
analyzing baseball games and finding
flaws in players. The Chicago White Sox
Manager between 19321934 he used film
extensively.
From 1908 until 1961 Sears, Roebuck &
Company sold a wide variety of sporting
goods, under the brand name "J. C.
Higgins." John Higgins was the manager
of the headquarters' office
bookkeepers. John Higgins consented to
Sears use of his name for a new line of
sporting goods. Since he did not have a
middle initial, Sears added the "C." In
1908, the Western Sporting Goods
Company (Wilson) began putting J.C.
Higgins on baseballs and baseball
gloves sold in Sears catalogs. The J.C.
Higgins brand disappeared shortly after
Sears introduced the Ted Williams brand
of sporting and recreation goods in
1961. Sears switched their glove making
contract over to MacGregor and they
made most of the Ted Williams gloves
