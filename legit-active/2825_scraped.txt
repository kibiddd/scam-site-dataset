Closed Caption
Closed captioning is the process of converting spoken words in visual media into written text. It provides a written description of dialogue, narration, and other important audio elements.
The main purpose of closed captioning is to assist individuals who are deaf or have hearing difficulties. It allows them to comprehend and interact with the content by reading the text displayed on the screen. TV, movies, online videos, and other media use closed captioning to be accessible and inclusive.
Open Caption
Open captioning involves permanently displaying text on the screen, visible to all viewers, regardless of their hearing abilities. Open captions will always be visible during the performance. You cannot turn them off.
On the other hand, you can enable or disable closed captions. This feature helps people who can't hear well, don't understand the language, or can't play audio. It benefits many different people.
Assisted Listening Devices
Assisted listening devices (ALDs) are technological tools designed to enhance sound perception for individuals with hearing impairments. These devices make sounds louder and clearer, helping people hear better in places like theatres or lecture halls. ALDs are devices like hearing aids, cochlear implants, FM systems, and infrared systems. They help improve hearing accessibility based on individual needs and preferences.
Audio Description
Audio description is a feature that assists individuals with visual impairments in enjoying movies, TV shows, and live performances. It does this by providing descriptions of the events occurring on the screen.
It explains the visual events on the screen when there are breaks in conversations or important sounds. This includes actions, changes in scenes, and important visual details. This narration helps blind people understand and enjoy the content by explaining the visual parts of the production.
