Road trips? No problem!
Yes, it's here!
Now is the time where we pore over the 2011 schedule, looking for any potential road trips to see the A's in another venue.
The A's open the season at home vs. Seattle, and the good news is that it's a weekend series! The opening game will be Friday night, April 1st, so if you're a NRAF who has always wanted to attend Opening Day, it's your year!
Interleague play will include a May and June series with the Giants, a trip to New York to see the Mets, and a weekend trip to Philadelphia (any takers?). Florida will be visiting Oakland this season.
Note the particularly brutal road trip at the beginning of August. The A's fly from Seattle all the way to Tampa Bay; from Tampa Bay to Toronto, and from Toronto to Oakland without an off-day. Yikes.
So what trips are you making? What do you think?
