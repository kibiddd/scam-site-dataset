British TV Show Contestant's Porn Star Granny Makes Headlines

LONDON — Popular British TV show “X Factor” contestant and singer Katie Waissel made headlines in the U.K. after it was discovered that her 81-year-old grandmother is a porn star.
According to reports, the GILF — Sheila Vogel, aka Ruby Tuesday — has appeared in the Red Hot TV film “Freddie's Great British Granny Bang” that originally aired on the company's amateur channel Red Hot 40 Plus and was so popular it then ran on its main Television X channel.
According to reports, the DVD is quickly becoming a best seller in Britain’s GILF market. A source said, “She does everything. She sleeps with G, who is Freddie’s sidekick."
A Television X spokesperson said Vogel is also an escort who works under the name of Cecilia Bird.
The revelation has reportedly shaken up "X Factor" producers who were busy trying to keep the lid on recent news of Vogel’s $400 an hour hooker business.
As Weissel gets closer to the show’s grand finale, an "X Factor" insider said the porn star granny news may push her over the edge and show producers fear she’ll crack under the pressure.
But executives at the porn channels are expecting sales to go through the roof because of Weissel’s  "X Factor" celebrity.
