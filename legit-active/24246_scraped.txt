Johnny Rivers – If I Were A Carpenter                                lyrics
If I were A carpenter - Johnny Rivers
Se eu fosse carpinteiro
(T. Hardin)  1972
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady,
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If a tinker were my trade,
Would you still find me,
Carrying the pots I made
Following behind me?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow.
I've given you my onliness.
Come give me your tomorrow.
If I worked my hands in wood,
Would you still love me?
Answer me, baby, yes, I would.
I'd put you above me.
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding,
Would you miss that pretty dress,
And those soft shoes shinin'?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow.
I've given you my onliness.
Come give me your tomorrow.
If I worked my hands in wood,
Would you still love me?
Tell me, baby, yes, I would.
I'd put you above me.
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady,
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have that baby?
