Brock big! Brock strong! Bigfoot bigger! Bigfoot stronger!
Antonio Silva is looking forward to the future and already has plans in place to make a big splash in the new world of MMA.
By going after one of the biggest bullies in the weight class.
It's nothing personal, of course. "Bigfoot" just wants to prove Brock Lesnar doesn't deserve to be ranked among the best in the world, he being one of them. He said as much to Tatame recently:
"It’ll be very good, I’m looking forwards to know how it’ll be like, I’ve never had issues with anybody, I’ve always respected everybody, but as a professional I believe it’d be interesting fighting Brock Lesnar. I don’t agree that Brock is the second on the ranking, it doesn’t make sense. This fight would be interesting so I put Brock on the place where he was supposed to be… It really doesn’t make any sense."
Although initially the idea was that there would be no crossover fights after the UFC buyout of Strikeforce, Dana White and Lorenzo Ferttita left the door open for certain fights "if the fans wanted to see them badly enough."
So is Silva vs. Lesnar a fight you really want to see, Maniacs?
