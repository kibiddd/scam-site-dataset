Yates, the cigar-chomping force behind Republic Pictures,
spent his early adulthood as a salesman for the American Tobacco Co.
(and later, at age 23, for Liggett & Meyers as an account executive).
At the beginning of World War I, Yates saw an opportunity to apply his
hard-nosed business skills in the burgeoning film processing business,
which led him to create Consolidated Film Industries (CFI) in 1922 (a
company that is still in existence today, although Republic Pictures
ceased operations in 1959).The 1933 bankruptcy of slapstick producer Mack Sennett presented a unique
opportunity for a handful of enterprising (though some would call them
cheapskate) producers along Gower Gulch (a section of Gower Street in
Hollywood, also called "Poverty Row," where many small, independent
producers and production companies had their offices). Sennett, who had
fallen on hard times due to a combination of circumstances he was both
unable and unwilling to confront, had his own well-equipped studio
production facility. Nat Levine, the head of serial specialist Mascot
Pictures, had his headquarters in a cramped building above a building
contractor's office on Santa Monica Boulevard. He immediately saw an
opportunity to go big time and approached Monogram Pictures chiefs
Trem Carr and W. Ray Johnston about a joint venture to buy the studio, an offer
they declined. Rebuffed but not discouraged, Levine obtained an option
for the shuttered facility. At the same time, Yates was entering into
film production with his fledgling Republic Pictures, and since both
Monogram and Mascot were customers of his film lab (to which they owed
a considerable amount of money), he held more influence than Levine in
convincing the Monogram executives to join under the wings of the
Republic eagle. Neither Monogram nor Mascot had owned much in the way
of any real production facilities, instead renting studio space
whenever it was needed. When Mascot and Monogram (along with Liberty
Pictures, Chesterfield Pictures and Invincible Pictures, three small
production companies that Yates basically foreclosed on) merged into
Republic, Mascot was killed off and the Monogram name was (temporarily)
shelved when production began at Republic in 1935 (beginning with a
John Wayne oater, Westward Ho (1935), released that August. This "marriage," however,
was not one of equals. Carr and Johnston, nominally the studio's
chieftains, constantly clashed with Yates, who they felt was a
tyrannical Hollywood interloper. One thing became clear, however--Yates
was, as Republic's chief stockholder, the financial force of the
studio. Levine managed to largely remain out of the fray (he was later
bought out by Yates and blew his money on the ponies), and by using
many of the same production techniques he had used at Mascot, the new
studio's output came to resemble the best of Levine's Mascot product.
Republic could also boast of having the best special effects/miniatures
department (headed by former Mascot employees Howard Lydecker and his brother
Theodore Lydecker) in the industry, a factor that greatly contributed to the
quality level of Republic's output. Chafing under Yates' autocratic
business style, Carr and Johnston finally departed Republic in 1937 to
reform Monogram Pictures. Republic would, for a time, dominate the
B-movie industry and often defy expectations by producing several
notable A-pictures (Lewis Milestone's The Red Pony (1949), Orson Welles' Macbeth (1948), John Ford's
The Quiet Man (1952), among others), along with a number of excellent programmers
that temporarily blurred Republic's image as a Poverty Row studio.
Yates' reign at Republic would last until 1956, when he was ultimately
ousted by stockholders who'd grown increasingly dissatisfied with him.
Much of the resentment was based on the blatant favoritism Yates showed
toward his wife, Vera Ralston, a former ice-skating champ from
Czechoslovakia who Yates repeatedly cast in big, expensive vehicles
that almost always lost money because of her near total lack of acting
skills. Also, Yates refused to license Republic's film library to be
shown on television, believing that TV was just a fad, a mistake that
cost the company hundreds of thousands of much-needed dollars. He
eventually "saw the light" and not only licensed Republic's library for
television showing but actually got the studio itself involved in
television production. By that time, however, it was too late. With no
strong production head and faced with the onslaught of television in an
era of declining theater revenue, Republic Pictures' sprawling studio
became more valuable as a real estate and film library portfolio than
as a functioning production company. The facilities were sold to CBS
and became CBS Studio Center, Studio City, CA. Yates died an extremely
wealthy man and eventually left Vera Ralston a very rich
widow.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jack Backstreet - correction (in the 2nd to last sentence) by Ed RybaFamilySpousesVera Ralston(March 1952 - February 3, 1966) (his death)Petra Yates(1901 - 1959) (4 children)TriviaWhen he was deposed as head of production at Republic Pictures in the 1950s, it was largely due his penchant for casting Czech skating star Vera Ralston (who was his mistress and later his wife) in lavishly budgeted projects which, even when co-starring the studio's biggest box office attraction John Wayne, almost always lost money.Discreetly helped finance (along with Bank of America, Joseph M. Schenck
and Louis B. Mayer) Darryl F. Zanuck 's Twentieth Century Pictures in 1933. Zanuck's
new studio would become a major customer of Yates' Consolidated Film
Industries.Uncle of screenwriter George Worthing Yates.His Republic Pictures boasted the best special effects (then called
"miniatures") department in the entire film industry, courtesy of
brothers Howard Lydecker and Theodore Lydecker. Republic was mostly a "Poverty Row" studio
but its miniature work far outclassed anything done by the majors; in
fact, Republic was often contracted by the major studios to provide
special effects and miniature work for them. The proficiency of this
department can best be seen in Flying Tigers (1942); although the film is chock full
of very realistic dogfights, bombing and strafing runs and other action
aerial shots, other than a few full-scale mock-ups for close-up shots,
every aircraft in it is a miniature.Republic Pictures' name was resurrected from Yates' first WWI-era stab
at motion picture production. He produced a handful of silent films but
found his Consolidated Film Laboratories (CFI) to be far more
lucrative. Always cunning, Yates would allow marginally funded film
companies to go into debt to him for raw stock, processing and print
duplication and then foreclose, and in 1935 he did just that with
the acquisition of several small independent production companies and studio facilities, and re-formed Republic Pictures. These tactics did not endear him to his industry peers but made him extremely wealthy.6 moreAllQuotes[to actor Don 'Red' Barry, after receiving complaints from a
director about Barry's troublesome on-set behavior] I picked you up when you were
driving a truck, and I can put you back driving a truck.Monopolistic practices are going to be forced out. Also the government will make the big companies divest themselves of their theatre chains. I went through the dissolution of the American Tobacco Co., and I saw every stockholder make more money and every employee benefited. This will happen in this business as sure as God made little apples. And the public will benefit, too, through fewer and better pictures.
