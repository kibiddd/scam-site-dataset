Dom Salvador
Som, Sangue e Raça
April 17, 2001
Brazilian Jazz
This album is an extremely funky, smooth, and natural-sounding mixture of different music styles like samba, soul, rock, jazz, forro, and baião. Considered to be a milestone within Brazilian music, the album has had enormous influence on the sound and development of Brazilian funk, soul, and jazz. Especially the famous Banda Black Rio, who would follow the lucid path that Dom Salvador laid here.                     - Philip Jandovský
