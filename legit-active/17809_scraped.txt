I used to live across the street from you guys, on Poston Circle, back in the day.Libby WillisMay 11, 2011Pam, I am so sorry for your loss.  You and your family and Johnnie are in my prayers.  Our families were close when we were kids.  Find comfort that he is in Heaven now.Wayne HowardMay 9, 2011I only met Fred once years ago, but I remember his work at WGNC.  True local radio where each station and each town had their own distinct personalities has vanished.  Fred joins the group of local radio heroes who were such a big part of daily life for mill-workers, farmers, and others in those days of yesteryear.  Gone--but not forgotten!  My sympathy to the family...he's behind the mike in Heaven now.Lee and Jan DanielMay 9, 2011Dear Family Members,  Please find comfort in the arms of Our Lord and hugs from your friends...God has received another dear one into Heaven where Fred is healthy and whole in his new body.  He was a fine man and will be sorely missed by all of you.  May God wipe away your tears and bring a joy into your hearts because of the Hope that lives within you.Debbie BadgerMay 9, 2011Pam, I am sorry for your loss.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during your time of sorrow.Showing 1 - 6 of 6 resultsMake a Donation in John Gray's nameMemorial Events for John GrayTo offer your sympathy during this difficult time, you can now have memorial trees planted in a National Forest in memory of your loved one.Plant TreesPlant TreesFuneral services provided by:McLean Funeral Directors - Gastonia700 South New Hope Road, Gastonia, NC 28054Call: (704) 865-3451How to support John's loved onesHonor a beloved veteran with a special tribute of ‘Taps’ at the National WWI Memorial in Washington, D.C.The nightly ceremony in Washington, D.C. will be dedicated in honor of your loved one on the day of your choosing.Read moreAttending a Funeral: What to KnowYou have funeral questions, we have answers.Read moreShould I Send Sympathy Flowers?What kind of arrangement is appropriate, where should you send it, and when should you send an alternative?Read moreWhat Should I Write in a Sympathy Card?We'll help you find the right words to comfort your family member or loved one during this difficult time.Read moreView AllResources to help you cope with lossEstate Settlement GuideIf you’re in charge of handling the affairs for a recently deceased loved one, this guide offers a helpful checklist.Read moreHow to Write an ObituaryNeed help writing an obituary?
