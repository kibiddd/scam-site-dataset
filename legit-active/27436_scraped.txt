These agents possess internal state representations, knowledge bases, and reasoning mechanisms that enable them to process information and respond to environmental changes without external intervention. Each agent maintains its own objectives, resources, and decision-making protocols while adhering to system-wide coordination mechanisms. They demonstrate adaptability through learning from interactions and experiences, continuously evolving their behavioral patterns to optimize performance and achieve designated goals.

And, in particular, to the theory behind weightwatcher. In this deck, I present:
• Core Mathematical Techniques: Explore the mean-field theory and the saddle-point approximation (SPA) in the large-N limit, which provide a clear derivation of the phase diagram.
• Simple Phase Behavior: See how the model predicts a phase transition—from a disordered paramagnetic state to an ordered ferromagnetic state—which parallels the behavior observed in neural network training.
• Bridging to Modern Theory: The math here is also essential for understanding the theoretical backbone behind Weightwatcher SETOL theory. Both introduce critical techniques that help explain and predict phase behavior in modern deep learning architectures.
Whether you’re a physicist or an ML practitioner, these insights offer a deeper look at how classical models inform today’s neural network theory.Diving into LTI: From the basics to Deep LinkingDiving into LTI: From the basics to Deep LinkingRustici Software LTI deep diveRedefining Efficiency in AI: The Impact of 1.58-bit LLMs on the Future of Com...Redefining Efficiency in AI: The Impact of 1.58-bit LLMs on the Future of Com...Gregor Lyttek This whitepaper examines how emerging 1.58-bit quantization approaches, exemplified by BitNet b1.58, address critical challenges in LLM deployment without compromising model performance.

An internal developer platform (IDP) streamlines these complexities, enabling developers to focus on building business logic.
This lab demonstrates how an IDP supports a hybrid development approach, where developers run some components locally while consuming cloud services seamlessly. Instead of manually configuring databases, authentication, or API gateways, they leverage platform capabilities for rapid iteration.
We’ll walk through a real-world scenario where a developer:
Onboards quickly with an architect-defined application structure.
Develops in a hybrid environment, consuming cloud APIs, databases, and AI services while iterating locally.
Uses Choreo-managed authentication without dealing with OAuth2 intricacies.
Discovers and reuses microservices and APIs instead of rebuilding them.
Debugs efficiently without deploying all dependencies locally.
Ensures security and compliance automatically, catching vulnerabilities early.
By the end, you’ll see how an IDP accelerates onboarding, enhances security, and simplifies cloud-native development—so developers can focus on building great applications instead of managing infrastructure.Tesla strategy for development in modern era.pptxTesla strategy for development in modern era.pptxhibahassan160702 Tesla strategy in modern era"AI-Driven Automation for High-Performing Teams: Optimize Routine Tasks & Lea..."AI-Driven Automation for High-Performing Teams: Optimize Routine Tasks & Lea...Fwdays Every day, managers and team leads face numerous routine tasks: creating and updating issues in Jira, running meetings, syncing the team, handling retrospectives, and managing documentation.
