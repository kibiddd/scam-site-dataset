Reviews from Tea Lovers who bought from us – Gee, Thanks!
Awesome Teas!
Had the opportunity to share a few cups of Darjeeling at my friend Chloe’s place. Though a decent Darjeeling fan, Chloe’s recommendation of Thunderbolt Tea made me fall in love with their teas. Recommended!

Pleasure to drink!
Thunderbolt Tea has never disappointed me. I have been buying since 2009 and still their teas are the best in comparison to others I have tasted. Always a soothing and loving experience.

Very Enjoyable!
Fresh floral with light amber liqor, I am addicted to Castleton Moonlight. Interesting tea with so much of a complex character rendering into something excellent. The best of the best!
