Mordecai Richler was a pivotal Canadian writer noted for his insightful and
often critical examination of contemporary societal norms. Born to Moses Isaac
Richler and Lily Richler, he creatively captured the essence of his upbringing
in Montreal’s St. Urbain’s Street, a backdrop that frequently featured in his
literary works. Though he spent significant periods abroad, his connection to
Canada remained a central theme in his writing, reflecting both his personal
heritage and broader cultural critiques.
Early Life and Influences
Richler, one of two brothers, grew up in a vibrant Jewish neighborhood that
deeply influenced his storytelling. This environment served as the setting for
many of his narratives, particularly evident in his short story collection,
The Street. After a lackluster academic performance at Baron Byng High
School, later fictionalized as Fletcher’s Field, he attended Sir George
Williams College briefly before withdrawing in 1951. His subsequent travels
took him to Paris and London, with intermittent stays in Spain that fueled his
fascination with the country. These experiences abroad informed much of his
early work. He married twice, with his second marriage in 1960 being both
lasting and fruitful, yielding five children.
Literary Beginnings
Richler’s debut novel, The Acrobats, emerged in 1951, set against
the backdrop of Valencia. It delves into themes of alienation and cultural
collision, reminiscent in style of Ernest Hemingway’s Spanish narratives. The
novel features motifs such as the alienated Jew, a malevolent German, and a
protagonist caught between generational divides. Despite its initial success,
Richler grew critical of the book, though he continued to explore its
underlying themes in later works.
Rise to Fame with Duddy Kravitz
Perhaps Richler’s most famous work, The Apprenticeship of Duddy
Kravitz, cemented his reputation as a masterful storyteller. Adapted into
a successful film, the novel follows Duddy’s tumultuous journey from a
troublesome student to a driven entrepreneur. Richler paints a complex portrait
of Duddy, who is both ambitious and morally ambiguous. His relentless pursuit
of land ownership underscores the novel’s exploration of identity and integrity
amidst societal and familial expectations. Richler’s satire extends to both
Jewish and Gentile communities, blending humor with critique.
Humor and Satire in the 1960s
In the 1960s, Richler’s work took a more humorous and satirical turn.
The Incomparable Atuk showcases an Eskimo poet’s rise and fall,
lampooning various cultural and nationalistic trends. Richler mocks Canadian
nationalism, anti-Americanism, and different expressions of Jewish identity
through his sharp wit. His subsequent novel, Cocksure, further
amplifies his satirical style, weaving a narrative filled with comedic
critiques of education, media, and social hypocrisies. Despite some criticism
regarding its protagonist’s lack of a positive vision, Cocksure
received the Governor-General’s Award, as did St. Urbain’s Horseman
later on.
Return to Montreal and Diverse Works
Upon returning to Montreal in 1971, Richler expanded his literary repertoire
to include television, film, humor, and children’s fiction. Notably, his
adaptation of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz earned an Academy
Award nomination, while Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang won the
Ruth Schwartz Children’s Book Award in 1976. In 1980, Richler’s novel
Joshua Then and Now was published, echoing elements of his own
biography through the life of Joshua Shapiro. The story reflects the
socio-political climate of Quebec in the 1970s, capturing the anxiety of
English-speaking Montrealers following a separatist victory.
Later Works and Social Commentary
Richler’s later years saw a blend of fiction and social commentary,
exemplified in Solomon Gursky Was Here . Inspired by the wealthy Bronfman family, the novel weaves Jewish, Canadian, and Eskimo myths into a compelling narrative of family fortune and decline. Richler’s passion for social issues is also evident...

in his polemical works such asOh Canada! Oh
Quebec!, where he vocally opposed separatism and the restriction of
English in public spaces. His travel writings offered insights into political
changes in nations like South Africa, Israel, and the UK, with This Year in
Jerusalem providing a particularly optimistic view of Israeli-Palestinian
relations.
Richler's Legacy
Despite his prolific output in essays and screenplays, Richler is best
remembered for his novels, which often grapple with themes of ambition,
morality, and identity. His early works, culminating in The Apprenticeship
of Duddy Kravitz, explore the tension between personal gain and ethical
integrity. Later novels like The Incomparable Atuk and
Cocksure employ satire to critique societal vices, while Joshua
Then and Now offers a redemptive narrative of perseverance. Richler’s
final novel, Barney’s Version, is a nuanced exploration of
self-reflection, featuring Barney Panofsky as he navigates personal and
professional trials. At his passing in 2001, Richler was celebrated as a
foundational figure in Canadian literature, renowned for his distinct voice and
contribution to the national identity.
