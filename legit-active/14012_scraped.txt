St. James United Church in downtown Montreal.
When I lived in Montreal, I used to walk by this church, on Sainte Catherine Street just east of City Councillors Street, all of the time, yet I never saw the magnificent French Gothic architecture until recently. Was I just incredibly unobservant? Nope. The front facade of this church was actually hidden from view by a narrow commercial building built between the sidewalk and the front entrance (which included an art supply store that I would shop at occasionally). The office building was built in 1927 to help pay for the upkeep of the church, and that eyesore was only just recently demolished in 2005 to restore the full visual impact of the church. It seems hard to imagine now, but, just a few years ago, this looked like a city block of wall-to-wall low rise office buildings, save for the entrance to the church, which was an arch with a neon "St. James United Church" sign above it. I can't find a good street view of the way the church looked when it was hidden, but here's a view looking out taken from the inside of the arch from Christopher Dewolf. This is another Autostitch shot composed from two horizontal shots placed one upon another, since I couldn't quite fit the whole church into one shot with my Panasonic Lumix camera even standing across the street. St. James United Church official website. Some more information from Wikipedia. Saint James United Church is a heritage church in downtown Montreal, Quebec. The French Gothic church was designed by Montreal architect Alexander F. Dunlop. It is noteworthy for its false apse housing church offices and for its Casavant Frères organ. When it was built in June 1889, it was the largest Methodist church in Canada, with 2,000 seats; it was nicknamed the "Cathedral Church of Methodism." It now belongs to the United Church of Canada, into which the Canadian Methodists merged in 1925. Its congregation founded the first YMCA in North America in November 25, 1851 (before the present church building was built) and led an active campaign for women's suffrage early in the 20th century. In 1927, to cover upkeep costs, the church permitted a commercial building to be built in front of its Sainte Catherine Street façade. The building, adjoining the church's structure, concealed the church for over 78 years, the church itself being announced by a large neon sign. As part of an $8-million restoration effort sponsored by the city of Montreal and the Quebec government, a portion of the commercial buildings was demolished in 2005, revealing the church once more, with a new square designed by Claude Cormier. Access has also been restored to the rear lawn from Sainte Catherine Street. It is located at 463 Saint Catherine Street West between Saint Alexandre and City Councillors Streets (McGill metro station), in the borough of Ville-Marie. It is designated a National Historic Site of Canada.
