What is a KIPP region?
What is a KIPP region? Each KIPP regional organization is a separate non-profit that oversees its local KIPP schools and provides schools with shared services in areas such as alumni support, teacher training, leadership development, community outreach, operations, and data analysis. KIPP regional organizations are governed by a local board of directors, led by an executive director or superintendent, and often partner with neighboring schools and community based organizations.
