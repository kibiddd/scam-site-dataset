"If you want peace and quiet, don't stay at this hotel. It was so noisy that I couldn't sleep the 1st night, and people banged on the door. There was a stain on the room ceiling, and the popcorn bits were coming off. There was dirt in the bathroom corners, and missing grout. The restaurant was only open for breakfast.2022-11-20""Some of the hotel clerks didn't speak English.2015-05-21"     < Hide

"The hotel was directly beside and across from 3 missions for the homeless, and there were intoxicated people lying on the sidewalk and around the hotel.

"Good location. The hotel room seemed designed for style rather than practicality. The closet door was hard to open, and the coffee machine was as far as possible from water. The bed was comfortable, and I liked the bathroom supplies. The arm chair was too large. Some front desk clerks didn't seem well-trained, but Mario was personable and provided excellent service.

How Do We Order Hotels?
We order the hotels on this page by how close they are to this attraction.
Most of our competitors order these same hotels in other ways that make them more money.
How Do We Define Motel?
To us, motels are smaller lodgings that have rooms you can enter directly from the parking area.
At hotels, on the other hand, you can enter your room only through a hall inside the building.
Hotel Booking Tips
Beware of non-refundable reservations that could cost you a lot of money if you change or cancel them. +Non-refundable reservations are a gamble that will usually save you less than $10. If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -
Don't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot – because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -
Always read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -More >
When you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.
The earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.
