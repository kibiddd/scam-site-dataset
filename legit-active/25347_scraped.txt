About Star Printing Inc.Large enough to meet your needs… small enough to care.It has been 115 years since Star first opened its doors in Coatesville, PA. Starting out as a classic letterpress shop, we have advanced over the years to meet the growing needs of our customer base and to respond to the capabilities of new technologies. Located now in our own building in West Chester, PA, we have evolved into a modern offset pressroom with a continued focus on high-end digital presses. This environment allows Star to maintain a flexible operation that is responsive to short-run, high quality printing along with large jobs that are better positioned with offset.
