What  Theyâre Say  About Us?
âThe rooms were nice and clean, staff was very helpful and friendly. They allow pets for a $25 fee which is returned after checkout and rooms are not messed up by pets. I will visit here more often when I'm in town. Very reasonably priced. Fridge, microwave, coffeepot in rooms, plenty of towels and washcloths available.â
Nancy Plass
Guest
âAlthough the exterior and accommodations are a little dated, everything inside was clean and tidy, including the room. The gentleman who signed me in was pleasant and offered assistance for any issues.If you need a room that is simple but serviceable for a decent price, the Royal Inn is a good choice.â
