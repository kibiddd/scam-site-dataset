Gangster
Gangster
A gangster is a criminal who is a member of a gang. Some gangs are considered to be part of organized crime. Gangsters are also called mobsters, a term derived from mob and the suffix -ster.
Gangs provide a level of organization and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters have been active for many years in countries around the world.
Some gangsters, such as Al Capone, have become infamous. Gangsters are the subject of many novels and films, particularly from the period between 1920 and 1990.
Contemporary criminals often refer to themselves as "gangsta" in reference to non-rhotic Black American pronunciation.
Gangs
In today's usage, the term "gang" is generally used for a criminal organization, and the term "gangster" invariably describes a criminal.
Much has been written on the subject of gangs, although there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a gang or what situations lead to gang formation and evolution.
There is agreement that the members of a gang have a sense of common identity and belonging, and this is typically reinforced through shared activities and through visual identifications such as special clothing, tattoos or rings.
Some preconceptions may be false. For example, the common view that illegal drug distribution in the United States is largely controlled by gangs has been questioned.

Is Nancy Pelosi's political career influenced by her family's dark past? In this eye-opening video, I dive into the shocking ties between Pelosi's father and the mob, uncovering the roots of her ruthless tactics. I explore how Pelosi's recent betrayal of Joe Biden mirrors classic mob behavior and draws a striking parallel to Marcus Brutus's infamous betrayal of Caesar. Are these just coincidences, or is there a deeper connection? What could possibly lead her to go behind the back of someone she claimed was a longtime friend? Watch now to find out the truth behind Pelosi's actions and the hidden influence of organized crime in politics.

100k for the Plain Jane different mechanism
Louis shades 675 I got better vision
Bought it competition but I rather chauffeur driven
My nigga rang me for the skorpz¬†told him hold a minute
Gold tips but I like my bitch up in white ones
Dark world sitting in the¬†trap till the light's done
All real made quarter mill took me 5 months
Lost it all, made all again, didn‚Äôt cry once
(K-Trap)
Plug talk these ain‚Äôt Colgate‚Äôs, I just air ones
Trap boy walk into the T, 5 pairs up
Bare tops, got a few bottoms but there‚Äôs bare tops
Opp block got about 5, that's our 1st stop
I need better wealth
Gave them hot shells
Now it‚Äôs soft shell yellow tail
Yacht sipping 42 cop the glizzy and the .40 too
Den we got the K that‚Äôs a naughty move
We just moving heavy weight
Sell it straight fill the trolley¬†but I see my nigga do the pellet way
Grip shotty you ain‚Äôt tried to do a man the¬†pellet way
Better going M.I.A you ain‚Äôt getting NFA
Compact cost me 5k but it's feather weight
Spa day in steam room need to meditate
Narcos doing dope deals in a hot tub
Bought her 2 heels she was hot stuff
Sea view eating seafood, bring the lobster
Red wine eating spag bol with the mobsters
Hotel talking to the link bout wholesale
Lost it all, made it all again, I‚Äôm like "oh well"
(Blade Brown)
Little bro just land road now he‚Äôs straight again
Welcome back here's a care pack gave him 8 of them
Culinary skills he's a fool with the catering
President, I‚Äôm just tryna Make The Trap Great Again
I see them tryna see what‚Äôs on my hand boy
It‚Äôs a BQ niggas thought it was an Android
Niggas tryna scheme on the G‚Äôs but the plans void
One call that‚Äôs a car full of hand toys
Name another rap nigga had them landing
Switch on the lamp, what‚Äôs the stamp? Check the branding
She looking at the tee, thought it‚Äôs Louis but its Lanvin
I pulled up listening to Raggaman, I‚Äôm random
Jugging at a high level¬†I can make the white treble
Kettle on my wrist fully rose this ain't bi-metal
Last 6 months copped like 5 bezels
Told your bitch pattern with the g‚Äôs, why settle?
(Chorus)
100k for the plain Jane different mechanism
Louis shades 675 I got better vision
Bought it competition but I rather chauffeur driven

Is Nancy Pelosi's political career influenced by her family's dark past? In this eye-opening video, I dive into the shocking ties between Pelosi's father and the mob, uncovering the roots of her ruthless tactics. I explore how Pelosi's recent betrayal of Joe Biden mirrors classic mob behavior and draws a striking parallel to Marcus Brutus's infamous betrayal of Caesar. Are these just coincidences, or is there a deeper connection? What could possibly lead her to go behind the back of someone she claimed was a longtime friend? Watch now to find out the truth behind Pelosi's actions and the hidden influence of organized crime in politics.

- LYRICS -
100k for the Plain Jane different mechanism
Louis shades 675 I got better vision
Bought it competition but I rather chauffeur driven
My nigga rang me for the skorpz¬†told him hold a minute
Gold tips but I like my bitch up in white ones
Dark world sitting in the¬†trap till the light's done
All real made quarter mill took me 5 months
Lost it all, made all again, didn‚Äôt cry once
(K-Trap)
Plug talk these ain‚Äôt Colgate‚Äôs, I just air ones
Trap boy walk into the T, 5 pairs up
Bare tops, got a few bottoms but there‚Äôs bare tops
Opp block got about 5, that's our 1st stop
I need better wealth
Gave them hot shells
Now it‚Äôs soft shell yellow tail
Yacht sipping 42 cop the glizzy and the .40 too
Den we got the K that‚Äôs a naughty move
We just moving heavy weight
Sell it straight fill the trolley¬†but I see my nigga do the pellet way
Grip shotty you ain‚Äôt tried to do a man the¬†pellet way
Better going M.I.A you ain‚Äôt getting NFA
Compact cost me 5k but it's feather weight
Spa day in steam room need to meditate
Narcos doing dope deals in a hot tub
Bought her 2 heels she was hot stuff
Sea view eating seafood, bring the lobster
Red wine eating spag bol with the mobsters
Hotel talking to the link bout wholesale
Lost it all, made it all again, I‚Äôm like "oh well"
(Blade Brown)
Little bro just land road now he‚Äôs straight again
Welcome back here's a care pack gave him 8 of them
Culinary skills he's a fool with the catering
President, I‚Äôm just tryna Make The Trap Great Again
I see them tryna see what‚Äôs on my hand boy
It‚Äôs a BQ niggas thought it was an Android
Niggas tryna scheme on the G‚Äôs but the plans void
One call that‚Äôs a car full of hand toys
Name another rap nigga had them landing
Switch on the lamp, what‚Äôs the stamp? Check the branding
She looking at the tee, thought it‚Äôs Louis but its Lanvin
I pulled up listening to Raggaman, I‚Äôm random
Jugging at a high level¬†I can make the white treble
Kettle on my wrist fully rose this ain't bi-metal
Last 6 months copped like 5 bezels
Told your bitch pattern with the g‚Äôs, why settle?
(Chorus)
100k for the plain Jane different mechanism
Louis shades 675 I got better vision
Bought it competition but I rather chauffeur driven
My nigga rang me for the skorpz¬†told him hold a minute
Gold tips but I like my bitch up in white ones
Dark world sitting in the¬†trap till the light's done
All real made quarter mill took me 5 months
Lost it all, made all again, didn‚Äôt cry once

Michael Franzese, a former New York mobster and ex-caporegime of the Colombo crime family, rates classic mafia movie scenes on how accurate they are. The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as "The Sopranos." Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as "Analyze This" and "The Simpsons."
Franzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in "Goodfellas" and "Casino." He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman," the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.
After Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of "Blood Covenant" and "I‚Äôll Make You An Offer You Can‚Äôt Refuse." He now works as a public speaker and motivator.

Gangster
A gangster is a criminal who is a member of a gang. Some gangs are considered to be part of organized crime. Gangsters are also called mobsters, a term derived from mob and the suffix -ster.
Gangs provide a level of organization and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters have been active for many years in countries around the world.
Some gangsters, such as Al Capone, have become infamous. Gangsters are the subject of many novels and films, particularly from the period between 1920 and 1990.
Contemporary criminals often refer to themselves as "gangsta" in reference to non-rhotic Black American pronunciation.
Gangs
In today's usage, the term "gang" is generally used for a criminal organization, and the term "gangster" invariably describes a criminal.
Much has been written on the subject of gangs, although there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a gang or what situations lead to gang formation and evolution.
There is agreement that the members of a gang have a sense of common identity and belonging, and this is typically reinforced through shared activities and through visual identifications such as special clothing, tattoos or rings.
Some preconceptions may be false. For example, the common view that illegal drug distribution in the United States is largely controlled by gangs has been questioned.
