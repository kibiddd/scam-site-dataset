Actor Jason Wiles played Maurice "Bosco" Boscorelli, the gung-ho NYPD officer on the NBC procedural drama "Third Watch." Wiles was working at the Parks and Recreation Department when he started to develop a curiosity for filmmaking. He got work on a couple of productions filming on location in Kansas City and made enough contacts on the set to inspire a move to Los Angeles shortly after. He appeared in commercials and the Bon Jovi video for "Always" before landing a role as Colin Robbins in the hit teen drama "Beverly Hills, 90210" in 1995. Four years later he successfully parlayed his "90210" experience into the lead role on "Third Watch." He worked on the show over its entire six-season run from 1999 to 2005. Afterwards Wiles branched out into theater, directed the indie drama "Lenexa, 1 Mile," and appeared in front of the camera in two cinematic thrillers: "Zodiac" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. and the remake "The Stepfather" with Dylan Walsh. In 2010 the ambitious Midwesterner had returned to television in the NBC mini-series "Persons Unknown" as Joe Tucker, the leader of a group of abductees that find themselves the subjects of a mysterious experiment. In 2011, Wiles guest starred on the comedic crime show "Castle"
