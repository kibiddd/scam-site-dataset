Public safety critic Francis Scarpaleggia told CTV that some provinces might create their own registries if the bill is passed.Government officials said such plans would not be countered, but it would not help in establishing a replacement registry.More on this storyCanada court protects hyperlinksPublished19 October 2011Canadians bid farewell to LaytonPublished27 August 2011Canadian forces 'royal' once morePublished16 August 2011Related internet linksStatistics CanadaThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesRussia and Ukraine agree naval ceasefire in Black SeaPublished3 hours agoThe long, slow road to a ceasefire, with no guarantee of successPublished2 hours agoTrump will 'look into' use of Signal app as he defends security adviser WaltzMore to exploreHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coachFive takeaways from leaked US top military chat groupWhy is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?The 30-year quest to catch a national records thief'As a student, Â£800 a month is quite tight'Strange spiral seen in the sky - BBC explains what it wasChris Mason: Chancellor says the world has changed - but what are her options?Millions of UK tyres meant for recycling sent to furnaces in IndiaThe Upbeat newsletter: Start your week on a high with uplifting stories delivered to your inboxElsewhere on the BBCAn explosive Agatha Christie murder mysteryLily and Miquita answer your questions about menstruationTom Hanks guides you across the AmericasStephen Mangan washes up on an island adventureMost read1Sussex university fined Â£585k in free speech row2Laurence Fox charged over Narinder Kaur upskirting image3Disdain for Europe in US Signal chat horrifies EU4Body of newborn baby found in bag at London church5Russia and Ukraine agree naval ceasefire in Black Sea6Five takeaways from leaked US top military chat group7Joey Barton guilty of kicking wife in the head8Grandparents arrested on suspicion of toddler's murder in French Alps9Unique two-clawed dinosaur discovered 10Reeves to focus on Â£2bn defence boost in Spring StatementBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
