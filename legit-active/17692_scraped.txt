Save The Date!
On May 1st, at Le Balcon in downtown Montreal, let’s raise the curtain, raise spirits, and raise some funds at Geordie Theatre’s first-ever SHOWTIME cabaret cocktail fundraiser!
You can help Geordie ignite social change by elevating young people’s voices through theatre – while enjoying a grown-up soirée of titillating burlesque acts, hilarious stand up acts, amazing acrobatics, sensational singers and more. It’ll be a little bit risqué and a lotta fun!
Come drink, dance, and donate… the drama is on the house!

Land Acknowledgement
Geordie Theatre is located on the traditional and unceded territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation, a place of profound importance to many Indigenous nations, including the Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee, and Huron-Wendat. We acknowledge the significant history and ongoing impacts of colonialism and the systematic efforts to erase Indigenous cultures and identities on the very lands where we gather and create, and we honor their enduring connections to these lands and waters, acknowledging the resilience of Indigenous communities in confronting systemic injustices.
We encourage you to read our full Land Acknowledgement to learn more about Geordie’s ongoing commitment to educating ourselves and our audiences about the real histories and experiences of Indigenous peoples, and the inclusion of their voices in the stories that we tell.
Geordie wishes to also acknowledge that we are grateful to those seeking sustainable solutions to our global climate crisis, so that we may continue to inspire and challenge our audiences near and far.
