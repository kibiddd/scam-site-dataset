Driving between Montreal and Quebec City
18 years ago
Save
I'm planning to visit Montreal and Quebec City in a few weeks (I live near San Francisco). This will be my first trip to Canada. We'll be flying to Montreal, spending a few days there, then want to drive to Quebec City. What sights are there between the two cities for us to stop and see along the way?

There is nothing spectacular on the way between Montreal and QC. However, if you go further on the other side of Gulf of St. Lawrence in the Charlevoix region there are a few good scenic points. Bay St. Paul region, St. Aime des lacs and St. Simeon and Tadoussac region where you can watch the Whales, that area is very nice, otherwise between Montreal and Qubec City, nothing great.

I agree, nothing interesting..but just east of Quebec City are the Montmorency waterfalls that you should definitely see - they are beautiful!

I'm somewhat of an expert on this! :-). As an Aussie living in Montréal, just about every visitor from home who came to stay, wanted to go to Quebec City so I tramped up there often. It depends on which route you take and how much time you have.
There are two freeways between the two cities. The most direct/fastest route is the freeway Autoroute 40 which bisects the island of Montréal from west to east. On this route, there is just NOTHING to see, its flat, uninteresting. Just hightail it to Quebec city and enjoy! In Quebec, do go down to the old Port area - its facinating and not quite so crowded as the upper part of the old city. A fab place to stay if you want to pamper yourself is the Hotel Dominion 1912. It is in the old port area (Le Vieux-Port) , has a car-park out back and you can walk everywhere in the old city. The hotel and staff are sensational - lots of great reviews on this site. Lovely little bistro restaurant on the opposite side of the square outside the hotel.
The other way is to cross the river out of Montréal (I think it is Pont Champlain/Champlain Bridge) from downtown and head to Auto-route 30. Again, its a pretty flat and boring drive on the freeway itself but rather than going direct to Quebec, you can take a detour through a beautiful area known as Cantons de L'est/"The Eastern Townships" - Magog, Lake Brome, Lake-Mégantic and Lake-Memphrémagog, Hatley, Knowlton. This area is about 50 kms slightly south east from Montréal (route 10) so you then need to drive a circle back up to the Quebec freeway. The Eastern Townships area is really so pretty and some lovely auberges in which to stay.eg Auberge Lakeview in Knowlton.

Thanks

sorry, I realise there is a typo in my previous post. The freeway between Montreal and Quebec that is on the southern side of the river is Route 20 - the Trans Canada freeway. However, if you've got the time do consider that detour through the Eastern Townships!

Hi Smarttraveller:
I am happy to find your post. I have been looking for information about the Eastern Townships and have found precious little. We are planning a trip in September with the idea of meeting family from Ottawa there. Is the area mostly scenic? Are there activities e.g. hiking, boating? Is it warm enough to swim outdoors? Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi Conshohocken
I think the Eastern Townships would be a lovely place to meet up with family. Theres, there's boating and walks, cute towns to explore - its very, very pretty. The web sites I put in my previous post will tell you more.
As for whether its warm enough to swim well I cant answer that one. If you go mid-summer, the weather can be very warm (up to 32 deg C) and quite surprisingly humid in the Montreal area. The lake waters could still be cold though.
Have a great holiday!

On Autoroute 40, how long will it take to get to Quebec City from Montreal? Is a day trip to Quebec City recommended .. or one day is simply not enough?

atlbkk03, one day is fine. It takes a shade over two hours on Route 40 - its an easy freeway. I did heaps of day trips to Quebec City when I lived in Montreall as all my visitors from home (Oz) wanted to go there. You're there mid morning, plenrty of time to explore the fascinating old city. You can even have an early dinner there and drive back, particularly if its summer and it is still lihy until later in the evening. Its a most do-able day trip

I've been reading your posts on the Eastern Townships and I'm really interested in visiting the area. I had been told that it was not possible to go to the area on a day trip from Montreal, but I notice in one of the above posts that someone says the area is only 50Km from Montreal - which doesn't seem far. Can anyone tell me what the best towns to visit in the area are and how long it will take to get there by bus or train (if this is possible).
Thanks
