Share on WhatsApp Two years after he was arrested en route to  that very event, Roman Polanski will return to the Zurich Film Festival.  The “Carnage” director will accept the lifetime achievement award that was intended for him two years ago, to honor his outstanding career achievements as a filmmaker.
The ceremony will occur on September 27, 2011, and will be followed by a “surprise” world premiere of a full-length non fiction film that will be announced at a later date. One wonders if it perhaps could be Marina Zenovich’s follow-up doc to “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.”
Polanski will not give interviews during the festival. Full press release below.
Zurich, Switzerland – September 15, 2011 – Director Roman Polanski will attend the upcoming 7th Zurich Film Festival to accept the lifetime achievement award that was intended for him two years ago, to honor his outstanding career achievements as a filmmaker. The announcement was made today by Zurich Film Festival Directors Karl Spoerri and Nadja Schildknecht.
The World Premiere of a full-length non fiction film will follow the tribute ceremony. Details regarding the film and the world premiere will not be released before the official screening on Sept 27.
“We are especially proud to welcome Roman Polanski this year to receive his award“, commented Zurich Film Festival directors Karl Spoerri and Nadja Schildknecht. “We have always been tremendous admirers of his work and we are delighted that we will soon be able to express this to him in person.”
Worldwide Acknowledgment
Born 1933 in Paris, Roman Polanski first attracted attention with his 1962 feature KNIFE IN THE WATER. This was followed by works such as REPULSION (1965), CUL-DE-SAC (1966) and his Hollywood debut ROSEMARY’S BABY (1968), which brought him the Academy Award for best screenplay.
His box-office blockbusters include THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967), CHINATOWN (1974) and the Holocaust drama THE PIANIST (2002), which won him a Golden Palm in Cannes and the Academy Award for best director. Following THE GHOSTWRITER (2010), this year saw the release of his film adaptation of the theatre piece CARNAGE, which was well received by enthusiastic critics at its screening in Venice.
Polanski’s cinematographic work has enjoyed years of worldwide renown. His occupation with such topics as social inability, angst and self-destructive violence is apparent throughout his whole body of films. He portrays his broken, lonely protagonists with often claustrophobic and surreal visuals.
