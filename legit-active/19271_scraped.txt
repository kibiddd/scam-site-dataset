Bright Eyes - Singularity Lyrics
Artist: Bright Eyes
Album: Singularity
Heyo! SONGLYRICS just got interactive. Highlight. Review: RIFF-it.  RIFF-it good.
Learning on the fly*
How to gather and analyze
Nothing is living if nothing dies
What an exception to make
Roundly rejecting our faith
When singularity comes
We will be fully revealed
Wandering limitless fields
When singularity comes
We will be abstraction then
We will buried within
All will be balanced
We will be one
Now we're on our way
All of our instincts accelerate
Nothing you imagine could keep this pace
We will know freedom at last
Finally make up for the past
When singularity comes
We will be faster than light
Whistling, skipping through time
When singularity comes
We will be cradled within
We will be perfect
We will be one
When singularity comes
Living in one mind
Every pin drop is amplified
Every outcome before its tried
Will make a rag doll of God
Wind up our new music box
When singularity comes
We will be fully revealed
Wandering limitless fields
When singularity comes
We'll be completely awake
Neophyte make no mistake
We're in this together
We will be one
When singularity comes
When singularity comes
