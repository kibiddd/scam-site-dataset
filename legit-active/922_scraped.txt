California 185
California 185 is Mission Boulevard in Hayward, E. 14th Street in San Leandro, and International Boulevard in Oakland. The state route approximates the route of Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) (former California 17).
California 185 (Mission Boulevard) north
After the California 92-238 intersection, this is the first California 185 north reassurance shield located in downtown Hayward. The city of Hayward is known as the "Heart of the Bay." Encompassing 62.55 square miles, Hayward is the third largest city in the East Bay (only after Oakland and Fremont). Total population as of the 2000 Census was 140,030. Hayward was incorporated as a town in 1876 and as a city on September 18, 1928. Photo taken 12/29/04.
The first traffic signal on northbound California 185 (Mission Boulevard) is at D Street. The large building on the northeast corner of this intersection is a museum, while a small park and library occupies the northwestern corner. From here, California 185 continues north through downtown Hayward. Photo taken 12/29/04.
This California 185 reassurance shield is posted adjacent to a gas station along northbound. Note the low, post-9/11 gasoline prices. Photo taken by Trevor Carrier (Fall 2001).
California 185 (Mission Boulevard) south
Approaching the California 92-238 intersection in downtown Hayward, the end of California 185 is signed with an end shield assembly. However, the California 92-238 junction shield assembly is missing the state highway shields. Photo taken 12/29/04.
Continue straight ahead to follow California 238 (Mission Boulevard) south to Fremont; turn right to follow California 92/Jackson Street west to Interstate 880 and the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. California 185 ends at this massive intersection near downtown Hayward. Photos taken 12/29/04.
