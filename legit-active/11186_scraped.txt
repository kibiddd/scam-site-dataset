Tracklist
Review Summary: All Shall Perish release a great record, showing growth in style and finesse while maintaining their signature sound.The third full-length record from All Shall Perish has impressed me greatly. For starters, I can't say this record is held back by filler tracks like The Price of Existence. Awaken the Dreamers takes everything about All Shall Perish and ups the ante, furthering their noise and forming it into something definitive, natural, and above all, meaningful. The lyrical themes touch upon betrayal and the impact of death, which really hits home when presented in this form.
The vocals still retain their interesting fusion styles, but this time around, they add in another one: Halford. That's right; it's very prominent in the second track "Black Gold Reign", which, besides being awesome, is a very meaningful song. I really dig the vocal styles, s well as the increased technicality in the guitar sounds. The drums sound more refined than ever - a logical progression - but show little other change from their last record. In some ways, this is a good thing: the drumwork was very good in their last album, and I have no complaints with the drums of Dreamer.
The record also includes three instrumentals, which help to set the mood for a morose night. The first one, "For the Ones We Left Behind", has a definitive '50s postmortem mourning feel to it, and it lends well to the title track, which is masterfully crafted itself. Possibly my biggest surprise was the presence of clean vocals in the title track and the follow-up song, "Memories of a Glass Sanctuary". The best part about All Shall Perish is the experimentation factor. It helps set this band aside from the rest of death metal, and they really deserve props, because they pull it off very well. Nothing in this album feels particularly forced - even the slow, solemn works like "Memories of a Glass Sanctuary" feel natural and very emphatic. This might alarm some fans who haven't listened to this record yet, but I don't view them as going soft. In fact, their other tracks off the record are the heaviest off of all their albums so far. They're maturing as a band, and it's coming along quite nicely through all their hard work at the splendid experimentation with new techniques and the refinement of their old ones.
"Gagged, Bound, Shelved, and Forgotten" is definitely an album highlight. Its use of incredible guitar and mastery of the vocals is just awe-inspiring. The next track, "From So Far Away", is another instrumental that works excellently as a mood-setter for the next track, "Until the End". This instrumental-into-full song is repeated with "Misery's Introduction" and album closer "Songs for the Damned." The closing song is just incredible, and in many ways, I wish they pulled out the six-minute-plus track length with this one. Its use of the whole band's talents has been high throughout the album, but only now, in the ending point of this amazing record, do I see them utilising their full power. It's such an epic release, Dreamers is, that it sets a new bar for Perish - a bar that I hope they opt to shatter with This is Where it Ends, their fourth and upcoming studio album.

I didn't mention the first track because I felt the second one was better, but "When Life Meant More..." is a decent song.AfterTheBreakdownMay 28th 20117245 CommentsAlbum Rating: 3.0I've listened to 3 songs off of this before but I never checked out the entire albumSpecMay 28th 201140799 CommentsAlbum Rating: 4.0When Life Meant More is fantastic. SsssssssMay 28th 2011683 CommentsI think if they took what the did on this album and improved it then it would make one hell of an albumEmimMay 28th 201136837 CommentsAlbum Rating: 3.5I really dig the vocal styles, s well as the increased technicality in the guitar sounds.
Need to edit an "as" in there.
Overall a good review, but in the future you may want to move away from the more track by track analysis seen here, and go for a more general view of the album supported by examples from different tracks.
In any case, pos.Pr0nogoMay 28th 2011379 CommentsThanks for the fix.
If you look at my past three or so reviews, I've done the same thing there: focused on describing the overall sound, lyrical themes, etc. before discussing highlights. My first review was a track by track, but that was requested.
Also, several staff here do track-by-tracks, lol.TheArkitechtMay 28th 20111673 CommentsI prefer the junz of The Price of Existence over this.AfterTheBreakdownMay 28th 20117245 CommentsAlbum Rating: 3.0^that exactlyEmimMay 28th 201136837 CommentsAlbum Rating: 3.5Just something to move away from as you review more.ButkuissMay 29th 20118358 CommentsAlbum Rating: 4.0I actually prefer this album to Price of Existence...shoot me. It sounded more unique, I guess. ShadowRemainsMay 29th 201128349 CommentsAlbum Rating: 2.5fehScrambledMay 29th 2011394 CommentsAlbum Rating: 2.5 | Sound Offthis cd was huge disappointment for me compared to PoE. In retrospect its not as bad as I initially found it, but that sour
taste is still in my mouth, especially when in the last song he wails "I HEARD YOUR VOICE LIKE SUGAR COATED IN SOU-ER"
fucking retarded lyrics at a time when something badass wouldve been, well, badass. good review tho, toss a pos yer wayAbyssalCreationMay 29th 20112064 CommentsAlbum Rating: 3.0No where near as good as TPoE, but also no where near as bad as some make it out to be.There are some damn good tracks on here.The Title track and Never Again being prime examples.timquirosJuly 22nd 201439 CommentsAlbum Rating: 5.0I can't believe you didn't put Awaken the Dreamers on the recommended tracks. That was the best song of the album.
This album is probably the greatest album I've heard of all-time. Every instrument is prominent, songs are well-structured, vocals are evil, lyrics are above average, heck! It's a masterpiece!
