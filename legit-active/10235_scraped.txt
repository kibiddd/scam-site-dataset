10/10
Lola
(1961)
Tim Brayton
Intuited rather than explained & felt rather than understood.
Posted  Mar 01, 2017
3/10
Nocturnal Animals
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Animated by a largely morbid revulsion at human beings that has disguised itself in a thick lacquer of outlandishly beautiful cinematography.
Posted  Dec 30, 2016
6/10
Hidden Figures
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Paint-by-numbers biopic about people who were almost beyond a shadow of a doubt more interesting than the film ever suggests.
Posted  Dec 30, 2016
5/10
Captain Fantastic
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Plays around with a lot of big words and famous leftist names, but it's strictly an affectation .
Posted  Dec 30, 2016
8/10
Fences
(2016)
Tim Brayton
If Fences was doomed to be made into an awards-season prestige picture, I really can't imagine how it could have turned out more satisfying than this.
Posted  Dec 29, 2016
9/10
Paterson
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A feature-length exploration of the linkages between routine, unexceptional daily life and the creation of art, and the kind of personality it takes to transform one into the other.
Posted  Dec 29, 2016
8/10
I, Daniel Blake
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A hectoring political op-ed about The State Of Britain Today, but when you've been hectored by Loach, you've been hectored by the very best.
Posted  Dec 28, 2016
4/10
Collateral Beauty
(2016)
Tim Brayton
There are, I'll bet, ways of making this work. Collateral Beauty doesn't find them.
Posted  Dec 28, 2016
10/10
Toni Erdmann
(2016)
Tim Brayton
The whole thing is, basically, perfect: impeccably-made cinema with a pair of smart messages hiding inside the driest, funniest movie of the year.
Posted  Dec 26, 2016
9/10
Baraka
(1992)
Tim Brayton
Among the most overwhelmingly gorgeous films ever made.
Posted  Dec 26, 2016
9/10
Manchester by the Sea
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A completely breathtaking film about humans in crisis, presented with a muted but still sharp-witted aesthetic.
Posted  Dec 26, 2016
8/10
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
(2016)
Tim Brayton
When Rogue One is good, it is VERY good. When it is bad, it is... well not prequel trilogy-bad, at least.
Posted  Dec 22, 2016
6/10
Ewoks: The Battle for Endor
(1985)
Tim Brayton
It isn't particularly good, but it is a considerable improvement over The Ewok Adventure.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
4/10
Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure
(1984)
Tim Brayton
Nothing but a transparent attempt to keep the brand name alive and the marketing spigot open, and it really does not attempt to go above that horribly mediocre bar.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
7/10
The Love Witch
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Mercilessly carve out a third of the running time, and suddenly we have one of 2016's best, most subversively smart and deliciously entertaining films.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
6/10
The Birth of a Nation
(2016)
Tim Brayton
It's so very easy to look at this history and wish for so much more than we've gotten here.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
4/10
Free State of Jones
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Absolutely nothing but a history lesson, presented in what feel like deliberately uncinematic terms.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
10/10
Laura
(1944)
Tim Brayton
It's one of the smartest of all noirs, and thus among the most enticingly savage and dangerous.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
9/10
The Wailing
(2016)
Tim Brayton
As great as any horror movie of the 2010s to date.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
10/10
The Exterminating Angel
(1962)
Tim Brayton
It's one of the greater pleasures of the film that its surface-level plot is weird enough to watch it for the sheer joy of Surreal farce.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
7/10
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A solid, self-contained piece of basic, honest blockbuster filmmaking.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
8/10
Diva
(1981)
Tim Brayton
[An] enthusiastic celebration of consuming beautiful things because they are beautiful.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
8/10
Hacksaw Ridge
(2016)
Tim Brayton
One of the most striking war pictures America has made in years: morally troubling and coolly jingoistic in more or less equal measure,
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
7/10
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Well-mounted juvenile spookiness.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
8/10
Arrival
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A fun movie puzzle in addition to being an emotional gutpunch.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
9/10
13TH
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Though it is surely better as journalism than it is a cinema, is essential viewing and probably the most important movie made in America in 2016.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
9/10
American Honey
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A perfect and sad summary of American life itself. It is a film that demands a lot, and which gives even more back.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
6/10
Doctor Strange
(2016)
Tim Brayton
It's not a tremendously rewarding piece of storytelling... But it's dang cool.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
4/10
Michael Moore in TrumpLand
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Barely-edited concert footage that could have been tossed on YouTube without losing much of its dignity and probably only increasing its overall impact.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
1/10
Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party
(2016)
Tim Brayton
It's hard to conceive of how the film could make its argument any worse if D'Souza was deliberately attempting to overthrow the Republican Party from within.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
7/10
Trolls
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Where the film really impresses, though, is in its creative use of the animation medium itself; no DreamWorks film has ever experimented so much in so many ways.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
5/10
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Anytime it tries to be more than a vehicle for Tom Cruise to flash his charisma and say tough guy things, it grinds to a halt.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
8/10
The Handmaiden
(2016)
Tim Brayton
The ending doesn't live up to what precedes it, but while it's working, this is some of the most captivating and effective cinema of 2016, or indeed any of the last several years.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
5/10
The Creature Walks Among Us
(1956)
Tim Brayton
The happenings of the Gill Man, and how he comes to walk among us, are there more to flesh out the story of a toxic marriage than to serve as the main narrative thrust.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
6/10
Tyler Perry's Boo! A Madea Halloween
(2016)
Tim Brayton
The best of all the Madea films.
Posted  Dec 17, 2016
4/10
Revenge of the Creature
(1955)
Tim Brayton
It's impossible to overstate how utterly tedious the central stretch of Revenge of the Creature is.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
7/10
The Ring
(2002)
Tim Brayton
A very strong movie in all the ways you need a horror movie to be strong. But it is a movie that could very obviously be better.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
9/10
Creature From the Black Lagoon
(1954)
Tim Brayton
The whole thing is ultimately just a '50s B-movie, but it's hard to imagine what they could have done to make it a better one.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
8/10
Portrait of a Garden
(2015)
Tim Brayton
A simple film, and delicate, and abidingly good.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
7/10
Into the Inferno
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Five wonderfully captivating documentaries that have been pressed together into one very weird shape.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
9/10
Battle Royale
(2000)
Tim Brayton
You would never suspect that a 70-year-old man made this film: it positively hums with youthful lust and rage.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
8/10
Moonlight
(2016)
Tim Brayton
The last third of Moonlight is certainly the most invigorating .
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
1/10
The Room
(2003)
Tim Brayton
One of the only films from the whole of the 21st Century to live up to every fragment of its hype.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
7/10
Café Society
(2016)
Tim Brayton
Eisenberg is more than enough to make deeply overfamiliar material feel, if not "new", then at least thoroughly pleasant as a better-than-necessary diversion.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
9/10
Graduation
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A particularly high point for mid-2010's art cinema.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
6/10
The Accountant
(2016)
Tim Brayton
While at 128 minutes, we cannot credit The Accountant with being efficient, it clips along at a good pace and true.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
7/10
Sieranevada
(2016)
Tim Brayton
The thematic argument does not become inaccurate simply by virtue of being familiar.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
10/10
Starless Dreams
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A collaborative act, with the young women deciding what story they want to tell about themselves, and how they want to use the film to communicate.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
8/10
Shin Godzilla
(2016)
Tim Brayton
It might not climb the mountainous heights of the '54 Godzilla or the 1964 Mothra vs. Godzilla, but it's right up there at the top of the franchise's second tier.
Posted  Dec 11, 2016
4/10
The Girl on the Train
(2016)
Tim Brayton
A tacky splat of exploitation.
