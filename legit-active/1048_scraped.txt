Seam Rippers
My original wooden seam rippers were honored in Oct 2009. ("Un-sewing in style," declared Mark Lipinski in Quilter's Home Magazine.) They're now evolved, still unique, and magnetic!
Steel-Tip Stilettos
Get a grip on your quilting, rug-hooking, embroidery, rope splicing, needlepoint, and fly-tying! Each half-flat handle stays put, has a steel-point, and a strong magnet.
Scissor Pendants
Are your snips lost in the couch or by the iron when you're at the sewing machine? This lovely, useful pendant travels every where your neck goes. (Even upside down... it's magnetic!)
Magne-Dots
My magnetic pawn-shaped "dots" can manage the mayhem on the front of a fridge. And quilters especially love 'em -- to safely swap out their rotary cutter blades. (watch 10-tool video)
Chained-Piece Cutters
Quilt-making is more efficient if repetitive pieces are chain-stitched. My magnetic tool makes follow-up job (cutting chain apart) equally efficient. (Includes DIY replaceable blade.)
Pin Control
Keep handcrafted control over your indis-PIN-sable sharps. My wood-and-woolen pin cushions, magnetic pin cups and itty bitty goblets will do the job with joy!
Needle Threaders
Forget those flimsy, thumb-print wire threaders. My original, magnetic design performs like a third hand! Select the wire type to suit your need. (Includes FREE* wire exchanges!)
Dbl-Pt End-Caps
Knit with double-points? Know the heartbreak of losing stitches between sessions! Elasticized caps keep your knitting secure and needles together.
Hybrid Crochet Hook
Thin metal hooks cramp my hand! This comfy wooden handle has a magnet and a permanent 5mm ("H") aluminum hook, useful for baby blankets, caps, and more!
Desk Pen & Stand
Ponder a perfect paragraph with pen in hand (or resting in a matching stand) rising regally above clutter on any author's desk.
Take a coffee break & watch WOODbyC history!
