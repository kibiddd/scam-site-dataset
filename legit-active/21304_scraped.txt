Taking care of a nose piercing the right way will help speed up your recovery. It can be pretty easy for bacteria to get inside the piercing, but following the proper aftercare will keep it clean and prevent infection. From washing your piercing daily and avoiding certain products, we’ll walk you through everything there is to know. Keep reading to learn the best ways to take care of your new piercing and what to do in case an infection forms.
Things You Should Know
Wash your hands with antibacterial soap before you wash your piercing twice a day with a saline solution to remove bacteria and promote faster healing.
Other than cleaning your piercing, avoid touching it. Leave the jewelry in place.
Continue washing your piercing if it gets more swollen, red, or painful, which may be signs of infection. See your doctor if the infection gets worse or doesn’t improve.

1
Touch your piercing as little as possible. It’s normal for nose piercing to have a white or yellowish discharge that forms a crusty residue, but avoid picking at it. Leave your piercing alone, and be careful not to catch your piercing on clothes, towels, or sheets. Accidentally moving your piercing can cause pain or prolong your healing time, so try your best to keep it safe.[1]

Wash your hands with antibacterial soap before touching your piercing. Body oils and bacteria on your hands could get inside your piercing if you touch it. Lather antibacterial soap on your hands and rinse it off anytime you touch and handle your piercing.[2]

Clean your piercing twice a day with saline solution. Soak a cotton ball or cotton swab in the saline solution, and hold it against your nose piercing for a few minutes. After cleaning your nose piercing with the saline solution, rinse your nose with fresh, clean water to remove any solution and residue. Gently work your jewelry back and forth to clean the inside of your piercing as well. When you’re finished, pat the piercing dry with a clean paper towel. Try to clean your piercing in the morning and evening to prevent infections and promote faster healing.[3]

Research source
Bath towels can harbor bacteria, so avoid using them to dry your piercing site.
To make your own saline solution, mix ¼ teaspoon (5.6 g) of sea salt and 1 cup (240 ml) of warm distilled or bottled water.
Avoid using a stronger saline solution or washing your nose piercing more frequently because it may dry out the piercing site and prolong your healing time.
EXPERT TIP      							Jef Saunders						 					Professional Piercing Expert								Jef Saunders has been piercing professionally for over 20 years. He is the Public Relations Coordinator for the Association of Professional Piercers (APP), an international non-profit dedicated to the educating the public on vital health and body piercing safety, and he teaches piercing for the Fakir Intensives. In 2014, Jef was elected to the Association of Professional Piercers' Board of Directors. In 2015, Jef received the APP President’s Award from Brian Skellie.			   				Jef Saunders			 			Professional Piercing Expert		  Our Expert Agrees: The most commonly recommended advice is to rinse and wipe your piercing with a saline solution regularly. The climate you live in can affect how often you rinse your piercing. Wetter climates can cause more swelling and require more cleaning. Drier climates need more limited cleaning with less swelling.
4
Leave your jewelry in for the entire time your piercing is healing. Once you get your nose pierced, keep the same jewelry in while the piercing heals. Even when your piercing looks healed on the outside, it may still be internally healing, and removing the jewelry could cause skin damage. Refrain from taking out or changing your jewelry until you’re able to tell if your piercing has healed.[4]

We’ll cover how long different nose piercings take to heal later in the article, but it may take anywhere from 2–12 months depending on what area you got pierced.
5
Put a clean T-shirt over your pillow when you sleep. Rather than having to change your pillowcase every night to keep bacteria out of your piercing, slip a fresh T-shirt onto your pillow. The next night, flip the T-shirt over so it has a clean surface. Then, turn the shirt inside-out so you’re able to sleep on it for 2 more nights.[5]

Research source
6
Keep makeup and lotions away from the piercing site. Cosmetics like makeup, lotions, or any other harsh soaps can build up inside your piercing and prevent air from circulating around it, which may increase your chances of an infection. If you’re applying cosmetics, keep them away from your nose so you don’t risk them clogging the piercing site.[6]
X
Research source
If you do get any products in the piercing, rinse the piercing with warm salt water or a saline solution.
7
Avoid swimming or submerging your piercing during the healing process. Water sources like lakes, public or private swimming pools, and hot tubs are all areas that could contain bacteria and may cause an infection. Stay out of these bodies of water in the meantime so your nose piercing heals faster.[7]
X
Research source
Stick to taking showers instead of baths while your piercing is healing so the water runs over the piercing instead of submerging it completely.

Recognizing and Healing Infected Nose Piercings
Download Article
1
Watch for swelling, redness, pain, or smelly discharge from your piercing. If bacteria gets inside of your piercing, then there’s a chance that it may develop into an infection. It’s normal for your piercing to have initial bleeding, swelling around the piercing site, sensitivity, bruising, itchy irritation, and whitish-yellow discharge (which is not pus) when you first get pierced. However,  if your symptoms are more severe, then it may be a sign of a more serious problem. Some of the most common signs that your nose piercing is infected are:[8]
X
Research source
Swelling and redness that gets worse around the piercing site
Severe burning or throbbing sensations near your piercing
Increased tenderness or pain when you touch your piercing
Yellow-green or bad-smelling pus discharging from the piercing
2
Leave your jewelry in your piercing. If you suspect that your piercing is infected, taking out your body jewelry may cause the hole to close and trap the bacteria inside your skin. This can actually prolong your healing time or cause a more severe reaction, so keep your jewelry in.[9]
X
Research source
3
Continue washing your piercing with saline solution. As soon as you notice an infection, maintain your normal cleaning routine with your saline solution to wash out the bacteria. Clean your piercing twice a day and avoid touching it in between cleanings so you don’t cause more irritation or introduce more bacteria.[10]

Avoid using any harsh soaps to treat an infected piercing because they may cause more irritation.
Avoid cleaning your piercing more than 2 times per day because it could dry out your skin and prolong the healing process.
4
Take over-the-counter pain medication to reduce pain and swelling. Manage any pain or swelling using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen. Follow the dosage instructions listed on the package for some relief while your nose piercing continues to heal.[11]

Research source
5
Apply a cold compress to bring down inflammation. Use an ice pack or a clean washcloth soaked with cold water and hold it against the piercing site for a few minutes at a time. The cool temperatures will help bring down swelling and soothe any discomfort that you’re having from the infection.[12]

Alternatively, a warm saline compress can help promote blood flow to the infected piercing, which can promote quicker healing.[13]

Avoid using chemical cleaners or healing ointments. Steer clear from using substances like rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, Betadine, Hibiclens, Neosporin, petroleum jelly, and any other ointments to treat your nose piercing. These ointments and cleaners can cause more irritation or build up inside your piercing and prevent it from healing properly.[14]
X
Research source
Strong chemicals may also kill off the good cells trying to fight the infection, which can make the piercing take longer to heal.
7
Contact a doctor if your symptoms don’t change or get worse. If your infection doesn't clear up or get any better within a week or if you notice that the symptoms get worse, reach out to your doctor and explain your symptoms to them. Dermatologists and general-practice physicians are your best choice; however, if you can't afford to visit a doctor's office or clinic, speaking to the person who did your piercing is your next best choice.[15]

Research source
If you notice a bump by your piercing that doesn’t go away, scar tissue may have developed into a keloid. To get rid of a keloid from a piercing, visit a dermatologist to find out the next steps, which may involve corticosteroid injections or surgery to remove it.[16]

Question
Is it normal for me to have to force the pin through my nose piercing and sometimes having blood and pus three weeks after the piercing?  I have to change the piercing frequently because they aren't allowed at school.
Community Answer
This is probably because the piercing hasn't healed yet. By removing and putting it back in several times a week, the nose is closing up over the piercing leaving you to re-pierce through the skin all over again.

Question
I had to take my nose piercing out, it was hurting way too bad because I got it done with a gun.  Will my nose be okay since I took out the piercing, or will the bump get worse?
Community Answer
Keep it clean and make sure you wash your hands before touching it.  Guns are not recommended, because you can't clean them as well as a needle.  To get rid of the bump, try a sea salt solution or an aspirin paste.

Article SummaryXTo heal your new nose piercing, leave your nose ring in for at least 6 to 8 weeks and always wash your hands before touching it. During that time, regularly clean your piercing by soaking it in a saltwater solution, which you can purchase at a pharmacy, for 5 to 10 minutes a day. You can make your own saline solution at home by dissolving ¼ teaspoon of iodine-free sea salt in a cup of warm distilled water. If you think your piercing is infected, look for symptoms like itchiness, redness, and soreness that won’t go away. You might also notice a bad smell or yellow-green pus coming out of the hole. While many infections go away with proper cleaning, you should see a doctor for treatment if it doesn’t clear up within a week.
