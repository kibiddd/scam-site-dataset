Firebaugh California
This small community is located northwest of Fresno off Highway 33. Incorporated in 1914, Firebaugh has grown from ferry crossing to a small agriculture based city. Before the railroad, the San Joaquin River was the major thoroughfare to upstream communities. The ferry, located in Firebaugh, was the major crossing for prospectors heading for gold country. Ferries were the only way to cross the river until the late 1800's when the first bridges were built. The San Joaquin River played a major role in the settling of the valley and Firebaugh is one of the oldest historical towns on the Westside.Firebaugh is part of the Fresno, California metro area.
