After a particularly difficult job, hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) head to Belgium to hide out until things cool down. Ray hates the medieval city they land in, but Ken finds its beauty and peacefulness enchanting. Their experiences become increasingly surreal and possibly life-changing as they encounter tourists, locals, an American dwarf and a potential romance for Ray.

With "In Bruges." it feels like Martin McDonagh opened a window in a room where the air has been recycled endlessly.

Times (UK)
[Martin McDonagh's] affinity with meandering, melodically rhythmic dialogue and volcanic eruptions of profanity serves him well in this witty, wordy film.

The Spectator
In Bruges has some cracking lines in it, a cracking performance from Brendan Gleeson as Ken, and some very funny, provocative jokes, but I still don't know... It's just all the violence that did me in.

Tilt Magazine
Nowhere did director Martin McDonagh better manage dark comedy than in his debut film (15th anniversary)
Rated: 4/5

Cinema Sight
In Bruges is a darkly humorous film that should be seen not just for the way it subverts genre norms, but also for how it sculpts and redefines them into something better.
Rated: 4/4

Deep Focus Review
The movie is about meaningful conversations, idleness, boredom, remorse, hard laughs, stark violence, and grotesque humor—I loved it.
Rated: 4/4

Filme fraco, o roteiro é mais ou menos, o elenco é bom, mas ninguém melhora o filme, as cenas de ação foram mais ou menos, mas não combinou com o lugar onde foi feito o filme, junto com os personagens que pouco renderam para o filme, e a história foi fraca. E o filme poderia ter cenas bem melhores.

'In Bruges' is a film that I was expecting to like. Unfortunately, it's one I was underwhelmed by. We were clearly on to a good thing with Martin McDonagh, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson (see: 'The Banshees of Inisherin') but I didn't enjoy them on this occasion.
There are glimpses of it working and there are still a couple of moments where I could see myself liking it. I will say that the final 30 minutes or so is better, though what precedes does the damage in my opinion. The humour is its biggest fault, only one or two jokes got me.
Farrell and Gleeson are, nevertheless, a solid pairing, as we see to far greater effect with that 2022 film. The latter is the stand out here, Farrell's character is a bit too irritating for my liking. Away from them, Ralph Fiennes is decent, his distracting accent is bad though.
Elsewhere on the cast, there are not one but two stars from 'The Walking Dead' universe in this - from differing spin-offs, interestingly. Clémence Poésy of 'Daryl Dixon' (great in that, fwiw) and Željko Ivanek of 'Dead City'. Love me some TWD.
I also love McDonagh's other work in 'The Banshees of Inisherin' and, especially, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. So I guess one was gonna be a miss at some point, fingers crossed I enjoy 2012's 'Seven Psychopaths'.

There are not many films I will sit through and rewatch, this is one of them. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions and despite the main characters nefarious jobs which led to a child being killed, you still can't help feel for Farrels character. Dark, a little twisted and hilarious a bloody good film.

I consider In Bruges almost the perfect film. It has the perfect cast, with a mixture of incredibly funny and incredibly sad moments.

This was pretty decent. A great score, and some strong emotionality and sentimentality make for more than surface level viewing. Loses points for being rather dumb/predictable at times and more or less un-unique plot wise. A decent "not Christmas" Christmas watch.
