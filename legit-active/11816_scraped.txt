After two years of laborious work, local artists Amanda Hughen and Jennifer Starkweather unveil their stunning artwork, meticulously detailing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Project. "Approach, Transition, Touchdown" is a series of prints, paintings, and drawings of the bridge based on maps, diagrams, photographs, and architectural/engineering drawings. Not content to watch from afar, Hughen and Starkweather went deep in the trenches, touring the construction area several times and meeting with engineers and architects involved with the project. Long in the making, this exhibit is especially significant because November marks the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Bay Bridge in 1936. It's also a nod to the new bridge—slotted to open in 2013—which will be the most complex engineering feat in the history of California and the largest self-anchored suspension bridge in the world.Working with the theme of place, Hughen and Starkweather's collaborations investigate the patterns and complexities of spaces that act as arteries and thoroughfares, each researched using current and historic photographs, maps, and data. The resulting artworks embody unique forms, simultaneously surreal and rooted in reality.Opening reception: Friday, Oct. 21, 6-8 p.m.Exhibition Dates: Oct 21 – Nov 21; Electric Works, 130 8th St., 415-626-5496jennifer starkweatherart exhibitelectric workslocal artistsbay bridgeamanda hughenRelated Articles
