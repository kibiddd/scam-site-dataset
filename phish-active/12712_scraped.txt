We wanted to test out Helix mattresses after the reviews I read online, and this store is the only one that keeps them out on the floor on the west side of Houston. Saad did a great job of helping my husband and I narrow our choices down.

I went to about 4-5 different mattress stores and I was between the Helix and another brand. Saad was the deciding factor and treated my wife and I like true customers and not just a commission check. As someone in Sales, I will say he was the perfect mix of real/down to earth and salesperson. I respect his professionalism. Would recommend him all day long.

Mr Butt did a fantastic job in explaining the importance of getting the right mattress for my wife and me.  We picked the Autopilot by diamond    It should be delivered in 7 days and I am sure that it will exceed our expectations.  Thanks again to saad for being a great person in selling us our forever mattress.

We have been shopping for a new mattress for quite some time now with a budget. The places we visited were way out of our price range. I would like to say that this came to an amazing end! Mattress on Demand in Katy has given us a great experience in a quality mattress as well as for our wallet. I would definitely recommend the best mattress store in Katy, Mattress on Demand!

Great to Work With
Larry at Mattress on Demand was great to work with. Very honest and showed us all options, regardless of budget. I honestly don’t know if there’s cheaper options and don’t care. This was our first stop and the service alone was enough to sell me. They even followed us home for delivery. Can’t beat that. Thanks for a great experience. Will definitely be back when the kids need a new mattress soon.

We recently purchased a new Helix hybrid mattress and adjustable base from Mattress on Demand in Katy, TX.  We had a great experience with Saad assisting us in making our final selections after our extensive research.  The experience was enjoyable with no pressure or hard sell tactics and we felt the price was fair.
