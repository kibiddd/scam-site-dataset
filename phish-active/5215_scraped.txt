★★★★★ 5/5
During COVID, me and my wife thought of having a nice master bedroom addition(with en-suite ) and walk-in closet that looks and feel like a nice hotel (since you can’t travel at that time). Center Island Contracting made that happen for us. We are very happy with what they did to our house.

Stumbled across CIC randomly searching contractors & so happy we did. Evan offered many options & worked with us to get our dream off the ground. Bill has positioned our job to be the best quality craftsmanship we could ask for & made us thrilled to work with them.

★★★★★ 5/5
Was very happy with the quality of work that we ended up with. We did a first floor demo including gutting our kitchen. The kitchen along with our fireplace/built-ins came out looking fantastic. I would definitely recommend Central Island to friends and family for other jobs. As well as anything I do in the future.

I had my siding re-done from cedar wood shingles to hardy board shingles and my house looks amazing. When I first consulted with Caleb he provided me with various options and I’m happy I went with his recommendations.
Sandra S
★★★★★ 5/5
Center Island Contracting remodeled our guest bathroom. They helped us with the design and then they transformed the plan into an amazing, gorgeous bathroom. They created a custom vanity mirror, custom shower shelves, and completed all the tile work. We couldn’t be happier with their customer service, skilled work and our bathroom results.

★★★★★ 5/5
Not only did they renovate a beautiful home, but they were professional on the job and provided honest feedback on all facets of the decisions made throughout the process. We were able to collaborate on many aspects of the home, from designs through selections of granite/cabinets etc. through accessories.

Caleb has a great eye for design. My project started out with some bumps in the road but he was able to maneuver around every problem and come up with excellent solutions. My family could not be happier with our backyard and landscaping. It’s like going to a resort every time we step outside.

★★★★★ 5/5
We added a second story to move 3 bedrooms, added 2 bathrooms (master/hallway) on that level, made our first floor entirely open concept, have a new modern kitchen, floors, windows, doors, siding/roof, and front porch. Our “new” home feels welcoming, bright and airy – with the end result exactly what we were looking for.

LOVE working with this company and the owner, Caleb Haniquet. He is very thorough, no surprises, detailed estimates include things I hadn’t thought of, and very creative designs.
