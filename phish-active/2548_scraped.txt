Cameras and GimbalsÂ¶
Copter, Plane and Rover support up to 3-axis gimbals, including advance
features like automated aiming of the camera at a Region of Interest
(ROI), and automatic triggering of a camera shutter.  Follow the links below
to explanations of how to configure gimbals and shutter triggering.
GimbalsÂ¶
ArduPilot supports both brushless direct drive gimbals (Tarot, SimpleBGC, SToRM32)
that have their own self-stabilization controllers and the simpler servo-driven
gimbals in which ArduPilot controls the stabilisation. Some gimbals also integrate still or video cameras.
ADTi cameras and gimbals
Brushless PWM - brushless gimbals that accept PWM or SBUS input for angle control
CADDX GM1, GM2, GM3 gimbals
DJI RS2 and RS3-Pro gimbals
Gremsy Mio, Pixy, S1, T3, T7 and ZIO - high quality 3-axis gimbals
Servo Gimbals â older-style servo-driven gimbal where ArduPilot provides stabilisation
SimpleBGC (aka AlexMos) Gimbal Controller - a popular 2-axis or 3-axis brushess gimbal controller which uses a custom serial interface
Siyi ZR10, ZR30, ZT6, ZT30, and A8 - 3-axis gimbal and camera
SToRM32 Gimbal Controller â an inexpensive 2-axis or 3-axis brushless gimbal controller which responds to MAVLink commands (a richer format than PWM) over a serial interface
Topotek Gimbal
ViewPro gimbals
Xacti gimbals
Gimbals may be attached to retractable mounts to prevent ground contact or to reduce air resistant in flight. Mount control is covered on the Gimbal / Mount Controls page.
CamerasÂ¶
Camera manufacturers use many differing mechanisms for remote control of the
camera (including its shutter or video recording). The following topics explain how to configure camera shutter and controls, and list a number of different approaches for converting
the output signal into the form expected by your particular camera. If the camera is integrated with the gimbal, control of the camera is detailed in that gimbals setup.

Common fixes for poor video qualityÂ¶
Some of the more common causes and solutions for poor video are listed
below:
âJelloâ effect (or rolling shutter) is a by-product of using a camera
with a CMOS sensor (GoPro, et al) caused by vibration from unbalanced
props/motors and can be mitigated by mounting the camera on soft
rubber, silicone, foam ear plugs or sometimes just on velcro.
digital and optical stabilization systems found in many cameras often
do not perform well because of the vibrations found on many
multicopters.
Exceptions: the Sony video camera balanced steady shot system is
very effective even at maximum 30 power zoom.
For better and smoother Yaw, use Expo control on your RC and lower
the ACRO_Y_RATE gain in the autopilot.
It is important to remember that even with a perfect setup, photography
is an art as well as a science. Using the camera pointing straight to
the ground is a good place to start, but more dramatic viewpoints can be
achieved with angles other than vertical. Mount about 40 degrees
deviation from vertical to obtain mainly ground photos but with an oblique
view. About 70 degrees off vertical will give you a lot more sky thus giving
more scenic photos. ArduPilot will stabilize the gimbal to whatever position you set.
