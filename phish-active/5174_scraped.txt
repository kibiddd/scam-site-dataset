Botswana beats Kenya in African Youth Championships

The national under-23 team lost to Botswana 3-0 in the first leg of their Africa Youth Championships match in Gaborone on Friday night. The Kenyans, who arrived in Botswana hours before the fixture, held the opponents to a barren draw in the first half, but fell to quick goals by Onkabetse Makgantai and Omaatla Kebatho in the 50th and 55th minutes. Kebatho added the third for the home team in the 86th minute and, with it, may have just ended any chances by the Kenyans to make it to the next round.
The result means Kenya have to win the return fixture scheduled for May 9 by a 4-0 to be sure of qualifying for the next round where Zambia await.
This is the second heaviest defeat by the youth side in a competitive match. They lost to Egypt by a similar margin in the first leg of the All Africa Games qualifiers, but won the return leg 1-0. But that was not enough to see them through to the next round. Earlier, Football Kenya Federation had made frantic efforts to have the match postponed after failing to get acquire a transit visa that would have enabled the team to pass through South Africa to Gaborone. According to Botswana media, the Botswana FA declined to change the dates because FKF’s request was put in late.
Botswana Football Association president, Tebogo Sebego, said the request by Kenya came too late to be considered. “We were unable to postpone the game due to logistical reasons. Our stakeholders were already invited. “The Kenyan Federation pleaded with us to postpone the match on Wednesday, and it was too late. “If they had told us on time, we could have considered their request,” Sebego said.
The Kenyan team is expected back home today and will go to camp straight away to prepare for the return fixture.

Kenya unveil McCarthy as Harambee Stars head coach
Published 3 weeks ago on March 3, 2025
By admin
The Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has today unveiled Benni McCarthy as the new national team head coach.
The unveiling of the new coach attended by several officials from FKF, government, sponsors and legends took place this afternoon at the Serena Hotel in Nairobi.
McCarthy who signed a two-year contract will work alongside fellow South Africans Vasilli Manausakis (Assistant coach), Moeneeb Josephs (goalkeepers coach) and Pilela Maposa (Performance Analyst) takes over from Francis Kimanzi who has been the Harambee Stars coach on an interim basis.
The new coach will go straight to work with his first games in charge being in the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers against Gabon and Gambia this month.
“I am delighted to be here and can’t wait to get started to make Kenya one of the best Football teams,” said the former Bafana Bafana striker who was also joint top scorer at the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with Egypt’s Hossam Hassan.
He also made it clear that he wants to take all the experience he has garnered working in Europe and in South Africa and put it into practice to make the Kenyan team very competitive and strong. “With the right leaders, right coaches and right work ethics I don’t think that there is anything that can stop us from succeeding with the Kenyan national team,” added McCarthy.
Hussein Mohammed, the FKF President said although many coaches applied for the job, they picked on McCarthy because he has the exposure in Europe and Africa and has the fire in the belly, and the passion that Kenya needs.
“Given his exposure and of course with all the support from the stakeholders, McCarthy will take the Kenyan team far,” added the FKF President who was flanked by his Vice President McDonald Mariga.
McCarthy who won the UEFA Champions League with Porto in 2004 as a player has managed South African sides Cape Town City and AmaZulu FC. He served as an assistant coach at Sint Truiden in Belgium, and was first-team coach in-charge of strikers at Manchester United under Dutch manager Erik Ten Hag.
