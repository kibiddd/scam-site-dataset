There is more to Scottish heritage than bagpipes, haggis and
kilts. Bill and Janet Gibson decided to keep the Scottish tradition alive by establishing the House of
Scotland over 50 years ago. Now located at 309 Whitehorse Rd Balwyn, the House of Scotland is the only
one of its kind in Australia specializing in quality Scottish kilts, sporrans and accessories as well as
jewellery, clan plaques, books and giftware.The shop is a must visit for those with an interest in Scottish heritage. For men who
wish to hire the kilt for dress functions, Bill can also provide a variety of different styles of jackets and
waistcoats to suit the occasion.
In Scotland’s turbulent past, a sprig of a local plant or
vegetation would be attached to a clansman’s hat to denote his clan. Nowadays, crest badges show which clan
the wearer is associated with.
“For that is the mark of the Scot of all classes… there burns alive in him a sense of identity
with the dead, even to the twentieth generation”RL
