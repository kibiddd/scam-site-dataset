I.O.U.by Lee Greenwood
You believe –That l’ve changed your life foreverAnd you’re never gonna findAnother somebody like me
And you wish –You had more than just a lifetimeTo give back all I’ve given youAnd that’s what you believe
But I.O.U.The sunlight in the morningAnd the nights of honest lovingThat time can’t take away
And I.O.U.More than life now, more than everI know that it’s the sweetest debtI’ll ever have to pay
I’m amazed –When you say it’s me you live forYou know that when I’m holding youYou’re right where you belong
And my love –I can’t help but smile with wonderWhen you tell me all I’ve done for you‘Cause I’ve known all along
That I.O.U.The sunlight in the morningAnd the nights of honest lovingThat time can’t take away
And I.O.U.More than life now, more than everI know that it’s the sweetest debtI’ll ever have to pay
Oh I.O.U. (I.O.U)The sunlight in the morningAnd the nights of honest lovingThat time can’t take away
And I.O.U. (I.O.U.)More than life now, more than everI know that it’s the sweetest debtI’ll ever —Have to pay

I Won’t Give Upby Jason Mraz
When I look into your eyesIt’s like watching the night skyOr a beautiful sunriseWell, there’s so much they holdAnd just like them old starsI see that you’ve come so farTo be right where you areHow old is your soul?
Well, I won’t give up on usEven if the skies get roughI’m giving you all my loveI’m still looking up
And when you’re needing your spaceTo do some navigatingI’ll be here patiently waitingTo see what you find
‘Cause even the stars they burnSome even fall to the earthWe’ve got a lot to learnGod knows we’re worth itNo, I won’t give up
I don’t wanna be someone who walks away so easilyI’m here to stay and make the difference that I can makeOur differences they do a lot to teach us how to useThe tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stakeAnd in the end, you’re still my friend at least we did intendFor us to work we didn’t break, we didn’t burnWe had to learn how to bend without the world caving inI had to learn what I’ve got, and what I’m not, and who I am
I won’t give up on usEven if the skies get roughI’m giving you all my loveI’m still looking up, still looking up.
Well, I won’t give up on us (no I’m not giving up)God knows I’m tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)We’ve got a lot to learn (we’re alive, we are loved)God knows we’re worth it (and we’re worth it)
I won’t give up on usEven if the skies get roughI’m giving you all my loveI’m still looking up

The Greatest Giftby Andrea Bocelli, Matteo Bocelli, and Virginia Bocelli
Come and lay your head upon my shoulderLook outside the stars are shining brightEven though it’s turned a little colderWe can light a fire, stay inside
Hear the angels singHear the angels singHallelujah from aboveSinging peace on earthThere’ll be peace on earthIf we open up our heartsAnd give a little love(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)The greatest gift is love(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Gather friends and family ’round the tableRemember those we love no longer hereTogether take a moment and be gratefulFor the joy, for the tears
Hear the angels singHear the angels singHallelujah from aboveSinging peace on earthThere’ll be peace on earthIf we open up our heartsAnd give a little love(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)And give a little love(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)(La, la, la, la)And give a little love
Hear the angels singHear the angels singHallelujah from aboveSinging peace on earthThere’ll be peace on earthIf we open up our heartsAnd give a little love
Hear the angels singingHallelujah from above(There’ll be) Peace on earth there’ll beIf we open up our heartsAnd give a little love(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)A Hallelujah from above(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)The greatest gift is love

Do You Hear What I Hear?by Andrea Bocelli, Matteo Bocelli, and Virginia Bocelli
Said the night wind to the little lamb“Do you see what I see?”Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lambDo you see what I see?Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the nightWith a tail as big as a kiteWith a tail as big as a kite
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boyDo you hear what I hear?Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boyDo you hear what I hear?Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song high above the treesWith a voice as big as the seaWith a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king“Do you know what I know?”Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty kingDo you know what I knowDo you know what I know
A child, a child shivers in the coldLet us bring him silver and goldLet us bring him silver and gold
Said the king to the people everywhere“Listen to what I say”Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people, everywhereListen to what I sayListen to what I say
The child, the child sleeping in the nightHe will bring us goodness and lightHe will bring us goodness and lightDo you hear what I hear?
