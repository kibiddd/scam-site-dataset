Introducing DES Vision System ‚Äì an affordable, scalable and easy to use app for asset/infrastructure monitoring, management and inspection.
Revolutionary
Previously, collecting structural health monitoring was too expensive. Traditionally, highly qualified, and expensive experts along with specialized equipment are required for this level of monitoring. It also took a long time for the data to be analyzed and results produced. Now with the DES easy-to-use app functionality with its visual inspection and sub-millimeter measurement capability, accurate results can be acquired in a matter of minutes and available at the point of measurement if necessary.
Explainer video ‚Äì How it works
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Flexible
In addition to using smartphones to capture the measurements, it is possible to use DSLR cameras when a longer range is needed for the capture. For difficult to reach sites, time lapse capture, or near-real time measurements fixed cameras such as standard CCTV devices and Drones are often used.
Easy to use
With DES Vision System, technicians, asset owners, inspectors or engineers can undertake visual measurement inspections using the smartphones they carry anyway ‚Äì no need for specialist equipment or training. Our AI-powered and ISO-certified app allows anyone to analyse videos and images to get rapid results on asset health.
Applications
DES Vision System was used by our clients in a number of countries around the world including Denmark, UK, Poland, Belgium and USA. The app found its application in the following use cases:
bridge span deflection under load
railway track displacement under tramway load
tunnel & building settlement
bridge bearing movement
asset or component expansion and contraction under temperature change
high-pressure water pipe displacement.
Client testimonial:
Martin Duus Havelykke, Asset Manager, A/S Storeb√¶lt (Great Belt Bridge owner), Denmark described DES Vision System as:
‚ÄùGround-breaking and disruptive technology that enables fundamental changes in the way bridge monitoring and asset management is carried out.‚Äù
‚ÄûThe mobile app measurement identified bearing issue early on and triggered maintenance action that ensured safe operation of the bearings and extended service life‚Äù
Validated + Certified + Patented
The measurements are highly accurate (sub-mm accuracy) and have been validated multiple times against traditional equipment.¬† A Calibration certificate has been issued by an accredited laboratory according to the standards for:
European ISO 9513
American ASTM E83-16

NEWS2023
May 27th 2023:¬†We are proud to announce that DES is among top 40 finalist of the AspBAN Project which is 2-year project co-funded by the European Union to rethink ports along with startups and SME‚Äôs!
üëâ Atlantic Smart Ports Blue Acceleration Network (AspBAN) includes a dynamic acceleration platform to activate maritime ports as innovation hubs. AspBAN is focusing on multiple stakeholders working collaboratively to implement multi-port pilot projects and future of the Sustainable Blue Economy in the Atlantic ports (more at https://aspban.eu/en/home/)
üöÄ Earlier this year DES participated in a bootcamp in Lisbon for 3 full days where we had an opportunity to demonstrate our DES Vision System to port owners, investors, and other stakeholders. The AspBAN has the support of 123 strategic partners and a total universe of 391 ports, from EU Atlantic, Norway, USA, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Mauritania, India and China.
We are looking forward to work with our partners to demonstrate added value that our computer vision technology provides!
