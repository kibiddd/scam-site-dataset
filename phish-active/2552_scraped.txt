Mounting the AutopilotÂ¶
This article explains how to mount the autopilot in standard and
alternative orientations.
Standard orientationÂ¶
The autopilot (Pixhawk etc.) should be
housed within a case (which includes foam over the barometer) and should
be mounted with the white arrow pointing directly towards the front of
the vehicle.
It should be placed close to the center of gravity of the vehicle (both
horizontally and vertically).  Generally this means it should be placed
within a few centimeters of the middle of the vehicle and level with the
motors.  It is not critical that it is placed exactly at the middle but
closer is better (there are no recorded cases of problems caused by the
controller being far from the centre of gravity).  If the autopilot cannot be placed at the center of the vehicle setting the IMU position offset parameters may improve performance slightly.
The board should be attached to the frame using 4 cubes of vibration
dampening foam approximately 3/4 inch square (3M foam can be purchased from mRobotics).
Tip
Vibration dampening foam is a simple and effective mechanism for
vibration control. If Measuring Vibration shows that it is not
sufficient, alternative mechanisms are discussed in Vibration Damping.
Alternative orientationsÂ¶
If the standard orientation of the Autopilot is not convenient, it
can be mounted in over 30 other possible orientations.  The full list of
possible orientations can be seen and set through the Mission Planner
Config/Tuning | Advanced Params screen, look for the
Board Orientation (AHRS_ORIENTATION) parameter.
For Roll values, positive means roll right (i.e. âRoll90â means board is
rolled right 90 degrees so the white arrow still points forward but the
board is standing on its right edge).
For Pitch values, positive numbers indicate pitch back (i.e. âPitch90â
means the boardâs nose is pitched up 90 degrees so the arrow points
directly up)
For Yaw values, positive numbers indicate the nose of the board is
rotated clockwise (i.e. âYaw90â means board is rotated so white arrow
points off to the right).
Warning
If the board is mounted in a non-standard orientation (i.e. arrow is not pointing forward) then please ensure the AHRS_ORIENTATION  is properly set before doing the accelerometer calibration.
