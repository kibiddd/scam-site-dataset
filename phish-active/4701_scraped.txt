Vehicles we have detailed     Precision Auto Detail and Tint was created for the connoisseur, owners of fine automobiles who share the same passion for cars that I detail.  It is this passion and appreciation for these beautiful vehicles that inspire me to help preserve some of the most classic and iconic cars, trucks, motorcycles, not only in the Dallas Texas area, but also throughout the U.S. I offer comprehensive car detailing and paint reconditioning packages to suit my clients’ needs, and I do it with professionalism and results beyond expectations.Luxury, Exotic & Specialty Car Detailing for the Dallas Tx. and Fort Worth AreaAll of our Clients vehicle's get treated as if it was my own, it will undergo a transformation that will be nothing short of spectacular, regardless of which package you choose. Whether you have a daily driver that you want to keep in the best condition possible, a muscle car that needs to have it’s original paint restored or an exotic that needs to be put through a full detail package.You are a successful professional/entrepreneur who has worked hard to be where you are today. You enjoy the finer things in life, from the fine dining, the high line clothing you wear to the fine automobiles you are driving. These pieces of automotive art are put together by some of the finest craftsmen in the world and need to be maintained properly. You even like to improve on the performance and looks of your vehicle by adding engine upgrades, wheels, body kits, interior pieces etc. Along the same line of thought we can improve on the paint condition given to your vehicle at the factory, by detailing it to a higher standard. You only trust the well trained mechanics to make sure they keep your car in the best working condition. Why would you put such a fine automobile, "your baby", in the hands of an improperly trained or untrained “detailer?” Only to see the finish of the paint and interior slowly deteriorate before your eyes. That’s why we have several packages available to make sure your vehicle is kept in top condition. Or to restore it’s condition back to the way it ought to be.Over the past decade, many car enthusiasts from Los Angeles to the Dallas Tx metro Area  have used the services of Precision Auto Detailing with great satisfaction. Most clients are acquired from word of mouth, friends of other extremely picky car lovers who will not just let anyone touch their vehicle. Whether it’s a maintenance wax job or a complete paint correction that requires a complete swirl removal of the paint, they know that Precision Auto Detail and Tint can handle the job right the first time. We can also take care of your car washing needs if the vehicle has previously been properly detailed. This is done with the Two Bucket Method, with two Grit Guards each to prevent any re-Swirling and Marring of the paint. Nothing gets done in a rush to assure that your vehicle gets maintained the right way. Because we service clients form Houston Tx, to Dallas Tx. and Beyond , it’s recommended that you schedule your appointment at least a couple days in advance.
