Capturing Moments, Creating memories
Who am I?Born and raised in the UK, I now call the world my home. My journey with photography began in 2010 while traveling for my office job, where I first picked up a camera and discovered my passion for capturing memories through a lens. I enjoy photographing people in their authentic moments across diverse cultures, striving to tell their stories through my passion for photography. Additionally, as a technology enthusiast, I find joy in exploring the world of product photography, blending artistry with innovation. Join me as I continue to explore and share the beauty of life through my lens.
