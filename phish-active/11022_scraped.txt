Itâs extremely easy to follow, it asks all the right questions and gives you multiple options when booking an appointment. Itâs pretty self explanatory and quick to complete once youâve registered for the first initial time and your information is stored. I love the freedom of booking my own appointments, and also for other family members all in one place. If only it was that easy for patients. That if by selecting to use the app app that it would miraculously reduce the amount of waiting time patients still seem to face upon arrival even with having booked an appointment in advance. The application is I believe if not already a success. So how about now focusing on implementing something that works with reducing patients expected waiting times. Patients coming in are already feeling under the weather and honestly would probably rather be at home. So when youâve booked appointment in advance and it ends up turning into more of a waiting game, thereâs nothing more painful than having to sit there on the waiting chairs under all those bright lights. Waiting times can often take in excess of what Iâve experienced in the past a two hour wait!This is what you guys need to improve on for the patients sake. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to voice my concerns and gratitude for your great app.

Great for booking
I love this app especially that I can book my GP anytime I need too. My husband and I have had our first child and now that she is 16 months old she is starting to mix with other children and with that comes never ending sickness. They seem to pick up every bug that you can think of and as it goes you need a doctor that you can trust at short notice. My husband has also had a life changing injury that has led to many heath related complications. He often is needing medical assistance at short notice and often needs changes in his specialised medications and only dealing with the same doctor is required. He canât just wait sometimes days to get an appointment like it used to be and itâs extremely difficult for us to go and just wait as a walk in patient.The absolute best part is that our GP is always busy and in the past itâs been hard to get an appointment especially one that works for us. Now that itâs online and I can book out of hours of the reception, I avoid the opening hour rush of people ringing for an appointment and desperately trying to get in never alone trying to get an appointment that suits them. Besides that fact that our GP provides us with the best treatment available, I give this app five stars for the convenience alone. THANK YOU ð·ð¤ð¤§ð¤

Fantastic
The drs are all wonderful as I have had a life changing injury and I need many medications that need authority approval being able to see 1 dr is vital for me and having this app allows me to make appointments out of hrs is a godsend as like today. I have been going to the 1 dr for years prior to my injury I had already had a relationship with my dr so when I need to see my dr for pain medication reviews I know I wonât be looked on as a pill popper so to speak not only are the doctors all wonderful in this surgery the admin are caring and compassionate always noticing if there is a change in my wellness and offer me a treatment room to wait in when Iâm really not doing so good. The nursing staff are a godsend  they are always greeted with a smile and can even make the needle phobia of teens have them with no dramas I rate this doctors surgery as 1 of the best I have been too as a mum of 7 kids as you could imagine I spent more than my share at the doctors clinics
