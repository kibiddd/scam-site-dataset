How I Can Help?
I know about your hectic schedule. And I WILL accommodate you. My classes are aimed at anyone who wants to learn the Russian language, has Russian family members or wants to work with Russian-speaking companies or get a government job that requires that language skill. Together we will cover survival and conversational topics, so even if you’ve never spoken the language in your life, you’ll be able to quickly jump in and hold a simple conversation right away.
1
Speaking
Practice speaking Russian with a native speaker - ME. Learn things you wouldn't learn in a class or from a book. We will learn new vocabulary every lesson and apply it right away!
2
Grammar
Grammar enhances communication skills and helps individuals think more clearly and logically. We will start with becoming familiar with the basic Russian grammar rules that you will be able to apply and build your own sentences and phrases.

Cultural Training
I will help you to minimize misunderstandings. We will learn about Russian culture and how to understand Russian-speaking people better.
