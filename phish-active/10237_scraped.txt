Grafana
If you're seeing this Grafana has failed to load its application files
This could be caused by your reverse proxy settings.
If you host grafana under a subpath make sure your grafana.ini root_url setting
includes subpath. If not using a reverse proxy make sure to set serve_from_sub_path to true.
If you have a local dev build make sure you build frontend using: yarn start, or
yarn build.
Sometimes restarting grafana-server can help.
