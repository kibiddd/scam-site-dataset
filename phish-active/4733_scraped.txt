13 Regional Magazines
Covering the
USA
For more than 100 years, the ACP magazines have served our local construction markets, celebrating
the
successes that have resulted in a more productive, healthier and safer built environment. As we move
forward
we will focus on the rebuilding of our highways and bridges, the development of new infrastructure
that will
serve our communities with clean energy and clean water, and the expansion of alternative
transportation
initiatives such as light rail and high-speed rail.
Our editorial content consists of local news and information about the people and projects located
in each
region coupled with national features on topics of interest and legislation effecting heavy
construction.
Associated Construction Publications - An ACP publication, serving contractors, design professionals, and owners involved in highway and heavy, non-residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, utility, and governmental construction locally and across the U.S.
