Q: How can I maintain the device lifetime?
A: When stored, the Router Mini-UPS will self-discharge at a rate that is greatly affected by the ambient temperature. The Router Mini-UPS should therefore be fully charged before being put into storage and if it is to be stored for a long period it should be recharged periodically to prevent it from losing its original capacity. As a guide, the Router Mini-UPS should not be stored for longer than the periods shown below without being recharged:
6 months at 20Â°C
3 months at 30Â°C
2 months at 35Â°C
If the Router Mini-UPS was not used for long time, it is suggested to charge it once every 3~5months
