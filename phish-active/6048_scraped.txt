Rooted in Community
Cooper Groove Grips got its start as a drumstick and continues to develop game chancing grips for baseball, golf and soon a lot more.  We’ve always known we had a great product, but to see how many people have found success with our grips is a dream come true. We want to thank everyone who has made Cooper Groove Grips a reality, especially our loyal fans, the Cooper Groovers. Because of you, we’re able to offer our products in a variety of ways.
