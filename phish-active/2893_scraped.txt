Low Power Lab ADS-B Transmitter ADSBMiNi
When we do ADS-B lab tests, such as test our own developed ADS-B receivers or do some ADS-B demo, we always need an ADS-B transmitter. However, all the ADS-B transmitters on market are essentially Mode-S transponders with ADS-B OUT function. These ADS-B transponders are designed to be installed on aircrafts. So, it needs some very complicated configurations. It’s OK when you really install these ADS-B transponders on aircraft, because you already have all the wires and systems in place to support these ADS-B transponders’ operation. But it’s a challenge when you want to make these ADS-B transponders work in lab. It essentially requires recreating an aircraft's comprehensive environment to ensure these ADS-B transponders operates as they would in flight.
Furthermore, these standard ADS-B transponders emit at a high power of around 250W. Such intense power levels are not only harmful to health but also pose a risk of damaging your ADS-B receivers, when persons and ADS-B receivers exposed at close range to these ADS-B transponders in lab.
ADSBMiNi is a low power, simple plug&play operation, 1090MHz ADS-B transmitter specifically designed for lab test applications. Integrated with a high-quality multi-GNSS receiver, ADSBMiNi can work independently without any other external devices.
ADSBMiNi can also be utilized for airport surface movement surveillance demonstrations by putting it on a car (please refer to our Airport Vehicle ADS-B Transmitter ADSBVT for professional airport vehicle surveillance applications). Additionally, ADSBMiNi can be deployed on a drone for drone surveillance demonstrations (please also refer to our Portable ADS-B Transmitter ADSBPGA, designed for ADS-B transmitters used on general aviation aircrafts or UAV/drones).

Portable 1090MHz ADS-B Transmitter Board ADSBPGA for GA and UAV
More and more General Aviation (GA) aircrafts and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require ADS-B OUT function. But most ADS-B transmitters or ADS-B transponders on market require complicated configurations and even certification procedures, because you need to INSTALL them on aircrafts. ADSBPGA is a portable 1090MHz ADS-B transmitter, so doesn’t need any installation, hence doesn’t need certification. ADSBPGA transmits your aircraft position, altitude, course, and speed on 1090MHz ADS-B, enhancing your ability to “Be Seen”. ADSBPGA includes a GPS, providing accurate and high integrity position data. ADSBPGA doesn’t have a shelf, to lower down weight, so UAVs can easily carry ADSBPGA, especially for payload sensitive UAVs. ADSBPGA can work independently without any other accessories.

Simple Explanation of What is ADS-B
ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) is a system or technique used in aviation that relies on airborne GPS and other equipment to determine an aircraft's position and other related information. This data is then broadcasted via onboard communication equipment to ground receivers and other nearby aircrafts. In essence, ADS-B allows aircrafts to "announce" their position and other details, enabling ground stations and nearby aircrafts to monitor and track their movements, or to say, “see” the aircrafts.  Why do we need ADS-B?What equipment are included in ADS-B?Why is it called ADS-B?What information is included in ADS-B?

What are ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN
ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN are two fundamental concepts in ADS-B technology. The first thing we need to understand is that both ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN refer to specific functions that aircraft can have.Just like how a person speaks to communicate their whereabouts and intentions, ADS-B OUT can indeed be likened to the "mouth" of the aircraft, constantly “speaking” (broadcasting) its own vital information to other aircrafts and ground stations. ADS-B OUT function allow the aircraft to “be seen”.Just like how a person uses his/her ears to listen and gather information from his/her surroundings, ADS-B IN functions as the "ears" of the aircraft, continuously “listening to” (receiving) the ADS-B information broadcasted by nearby aircrafts. ADS-B IN function allows the aircraft to “see”.

ADS-B Data Link
As introduced in the Simple Explanation of What is ADS-B, ADS-B relies on communication equipment to transmit the aircraft's own ADS-B information to other aircrafts and ground stations. This communication link is known as the ADS-B data link.There're three tyeps of data link that ADS-B utilize, 1090ESï¼Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) and VDL M4.What are the advantages and disadvantages of the three ADS-B data links?Which datalink should ADS-B use?

ADS-B Standards
While the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sets global standards and recommendations for aviation, including ADS-B, the practical implementation and compliance with ADS-B standards often rely on industry-specific organizations such as the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) in the United States, EUROCAE (The European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment) and EUROCONTROL in Europe.Such as, DO-242, DO-260, DO-282, ED-102, ED-129, Asterix Cat021, TSO-C166, AMC20-24.

Do all aircraft have ADS-B
To answer this question, let's first understand what are ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN. Then we come back to this question, do all aircraft have ADS-B? To address this question effectively, let's categorize "aircraft" into three distinct types:Air carrier aircraftsGeneral aviation aircraftsUAV/drones

The difference between Radar and ADS-B
Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) are both types of radar systems used in aviation for aircraft detection and tracking. While both radar and ADS-B are used for aircraft surveillance, they operate on different principles and provide different levels of information. Below is an overview highlighting the distinctions between radar and ADS-B in aviation.
