Hacker culture
The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed "hacking". However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but the manner in which it is done: hacking entails some form of excellence, for example exploring the limits of what is possible, thereby doing something exciting and meaningful. Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have "hack value" and are termed "hacks" (examples include pranks at MIT intended to demonstrate technical aptitude and cleverness). The hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Bybit CEO Says 77% of Stolen Funds From Record $1.4B Hack Still Traceable
Some 417,348 ETH, valued at approximately $1 billion remain traceable on the blockchain after being moved using privacy-focused THORChain.
Over 77% of the funds stolen in a record hack on crypto exchange Bybit remain traceable, while 20% have "gone dark" and are untraceable, CEO Ben Zhou said in an update on X early Tuesday.
‚ÄúThis and the coming week is critical for fund freezing as the funds will start to clear at exchanges, otc and p2p,‚Äù Zhou said, referring to the hackers' efforts of laundering the money and converting it to cash.
Some 417,348 ether (ETH), valued at approximately $1 billion remain traceable on the blockchain after being moved using privacy-focused THORChain. Another 20% of the funds, roughly 79,655 ETH or $200 million, have "gone dark" through ExCH.

How I hacked a hardware crypto wallet and recovered $2 million
I was contacted to hack a Trezor One hardware wallet and recover $2 million worth of cryptocurrency (in the form of THETA). Knowing that existing research was already out there for this device, it seemed like it would be a slam dunk. Little did I realize the project would turn into a roller coaster ride with over three months of experimentation, failures, successes, and heart-stopping moments. It reminded me that hacking is always unpredictable, exciting, and educational, no matter how long you've been doing it. In this case, the stakes were higher than normal: I only had one chance to get it right.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam.

Some 417,348 ETH, valued at approximately $1 billion remain traceable on the blockchain after being moved using privacy-focused THORChain.
Over 77% of the funds stolen in a record hack on crypto exchange Bybit remain traceable, while 20% have "gone dark" and are untraceable, CEO Ben Zhou said in an update on X early Tuesday.
‚ÄúThis and the coming week is critical for fund freezing as the funds will start to clear at exchanges, otc and p2p,‚Äù Zhou said, referring to the hackers' efforts of laundering the money and converting it to cash.
Some 417,348 ether (ETH), valued at approximately $1 billion remain traceable on the blockchain after being moved using privacy-focused THORChain. Another 20% of the funds, roughly 79,655 ETH or $200 million, have "gone dark" through ExCH.
A smaller portion, 40,233 ETH or $100 million, had passed through OKX‚Äôs web3 proxy, but 23,553 ETH, worth $65 million, remain untraceable.
Zhou said the hackers converted 83% of the stolen ETH ‚Äî 361,255 ETH; or $900 million ‚Äî into BTC, distributing it across 6,954 wallets, with an average of 1.71 BTC per wallet using THORChain.
THORChain has processed $4.66 billion in swaps in the week ending March 2, the highest tally on record, according to data source DefiLlama ‚Äî making it over $5.5 million in fees from the illicit flows.
North Korean hacking group Lazarus targeted Bybit in late February by injecting malicious code into SafeWallet, a third-party wallet platform used by the exchange, to steal billions in customer assets from the exchange.
The attackers compromised a developer‚Äôs device, enabling them to manipulate a routine wallet transfer and siphon off nearly $1.5 billion in ETH.
Bybit fully returned to a 1:1 backing of client assets days after the attack, as CoinDesk previously reported. Address activity suggests more than $400 million were purchased through over-the-counter trading, with another $300 million brought directly from exchanges.

I was contacted to hack a Trezor One hardware wallet and recover $2 million worth of cryptocurrency (in the form of THETA). Knowing that existing research was already out there for this device, it seemed like it would be a slam dunk. Little did I realize the project would turn into a roller coaster ride with over three months of experimentation, failures, successes, and heart-stopping moments. It reminded me that hacking is always unpredictable, exciting, and educational, no matter how long you've been doing it. In this case, the stakes were higher than normal: I only had one chance to get it right.

Harri Hursti discusses the limitations of blockchain technology in elections, explaining why hackers generally aren't fans of it. He points out that blockchain is not a solution for voting systems and that it creates more problems than it solves, despite common misconceptions.

An 18-year-old genius exploited Indexed Finance and stole $16 million. This started a digital manhunt, following a trail of clues to identify the hacker.
Meanwhile, Andean Medjedovic feels no remorse for what he did. According to him, users were simply "out-traded".

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.

When Mt. Gox collapsed in the early months of 2014, it marked one of the largest financial heists in history ‚Äì yet no one knew who was responsible for the hack. With billions of dollars missing and thousands of angry creditors demanding justice, the pressure was on to find the criminals behind it. In this mini-documentary, I tell the story of Mt. Gox.
