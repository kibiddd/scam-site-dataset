About
Fakin' The Funk? is a tool that helps you to detect the true quality of your audio files in one batch.
Nowadays you can download tunes from anywhere.
But what is the real quality of these files?
What if you could check those tunes to see if theyâre really that good, and not upscaled 128kbps to 320kbps MP3s?
You could batch-process them all without having to manually check them 1-by-1 using a spectrum analyzer?
Import your music files.
Fakin' The Funk? will analyze the right bitrate and frequency.
If it finds a wrong bitrate or lower frequency-peak, it will show you the actual bitrate.
Itâs up to you whether you want to rename those files, copy or move. Or just delete them.
Fakin' The Funk? Keep it real.

F.A.Q
F.A.Q
Q: How fast does Fakin' The Funk? process my files?
A: That's hard to say, because it depends mainly on the speed of the HDD and CPU.
For instance, on a i7 with SSD, Fakin' The Funk? will process 1,000 files in 40 seconds. On the same machine, but importing from a SATA drive, it takes 72 seconds. Importing from an USB drive will be significantly slower.
Q: Does Fakin' The Funk? modify my audio-files?
A: No, Fakin' The Funk? will not modify your files. That means, the content will not change.
But - if you have selected one of those options when saving the results - the file might be renamed / copied / moved as you have selected!
Q: Can Fakin' The Funk? analyze every audio file?
A: No. Fakin' The Funk? supports the common audio-formats MP3, MP4/M4A, OGG, OPUS, FLAC, WMA, AAC, ALAC, MPC, SPX, SFX, TTA and WAV.
Fakin' The Funk? can *NOT* process any DRM protected files.
To get a reliable analysis result, the song length should be at least 10 seconds. Processing files shorter than 0.5 seconds is not recommended and might cause Fakin' The Funk? to fail.
Q: How many files can I import?
A: There is no hard limit. Fakin' The Funk? has been tested with 60,000 files and worked absolutely fine, with ultra-smooth performance. You should have no problems with 100,000 files or more.
Q: How precise is the value for "actual bitrate"?
A: The analysis process is very defensive. That means: If Fakin' The Funk? reports a file as "fake", then the chance is very, VERY high that there really is something wrong with it.
But being honest, it is just NOT possible to compute a 100% accurate bitrate from the pure audio-stream. So there MIGHT be false positives.
Q: What is a "defective" file? It seems to play without problems!
A: Fakin' The Funk? first reads the header of the file, which contains (among other things) the total length of the song. Then it scans through the audio frames and calculates the actual song length. If there is a mentionable difference in these two values, the file will be marked as "defective".
In some cases, this is only a "bug" in the header. In other cases it happens that the song simply stops in the middle of playing.
