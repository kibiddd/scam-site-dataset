IMAGINE A PLACE...
...where you can belong to a school club, a gaming group, or a worldwide art community. Where just
you and a handful of friends can spend time together. A place that makes it easy to talk every day
and hang out more often.

Create an invte-only place where you belong
Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share, and
just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat.
Where hanging out is easy
Grab a seat in a voice channel when you’re free. Friends in your server can see you’re
around
and instantly pop in to talk without having to call.
From few to a fandom
Get any community running with moderation tools and custom member access. Give members special
powers, set up private channels, and more.
RELIABLE TECH FOR STAYING CLOSE
Low-latency voice and video feels like you’re in the same room. Wave hello over video, watch friends
stream their games, or gather up and have a drawing session with screen share.
