Brent Palmatier
Brighton is a fantastic organization to work with. They are very professional and their communities have created a very positive impact on the Treasure Valley as a whole.
David H. Bieter, Former Mayor, Boise City
Brighton is well known throughout Boise for its high-quality developments, commitment to outstanding customer service, and most importantly, for the community-minded approach it takes to all of its activities.
Tammy de Weerd, Former Mayor, Meridian City
Brighton is more than just a developer. They are the epitome of what it means to be a community partner... They routinely go above-and-beyond what is asked of them.
Jim Everett, Former CEO Treasure Valley Family YMCA
Brighton is a community-minded, ethical and generous company that I have had the pleasure to work with in my 40-year career with the YMCA.
