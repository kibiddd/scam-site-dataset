Our Customer Reviews
Hired Inside Out Construction for a complete basement finish project (wet bar, bathroom, bedroom, TV room) and everything turned out great. Josh and his crew worked closely with us to make sure we got everything we asked for. The estimate was clear and we understood where all the money we paid (which was less than multiple other estimates) was going. I would recommend IOC for any project in my home.
Jeremy
It was so much fun working with Inside Out. I have done multiple renovation before but this time was different because Josh and his team were so professional. They did what they promised, were creative in finding cost cutting solutions, and they treated my home with respect. Each day prior to leaving, they cleaned the site...I have never experienced this before. It was amazing.
Deborah
We just had IOC do a master bath renovation. Complete gut job and installed new vanity, pocket doors, shower and sauna. The custom shelves were perfect. I would highly recommend them.
