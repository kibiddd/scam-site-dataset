App Installation Instructions:
1. If necessary, uninstall the App Store version of the app if you have it installed on your iDevice. Make sure to back it up so you don't lose your progress. Alternatively, you can use the 'Custom Install' option to install the new app as a duplicate without having to overwrite or uninstall the original.
2. Once the installation is complete and you see the app on your Home Screen, you will now need to go to Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management. Once there, you will need to trust the new certificate that is related to the app you just installed. Then simply open the (hacked) app.
