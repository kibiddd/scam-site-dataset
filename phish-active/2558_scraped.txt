ESC calibrationÂ¶
Most models of PWM based ESC need to be calibrated to ensure that all
the ESCs respond to the same input with the same speed. To calibrate
them they need to receive maximum PWM input when initially powered on,
then receive minimum PWM input when they have beeped to indicate that
the maximum has registered.
The method for calibrating the ESCs on an ArduPilot QuadPlane depends
on what version of the firmware you have loaded. The old method is
used on versions prior to the 3.6.0 release. The new method is used on
3.6.0 and later.
Warning
You must remove all propellers from your vehicle before doing any
ESC calibration. Calibrating with propellers installed is dangerous.
ESC Calibration Procedure (3.6.0 and later)Â¶
This process uses the Q_ESC_CAL parameter to enable
ESC calibration in QSTABILIZE mode. There are two modes of operation
available:
with Q_ESC_CAL=1 the output to the motors will come directly from
the throttle stick in QSTABILIZE mode when the vehicle is armed
with Q_ESC_CAL=2 the output to the motors will be full throttle
when the motors are armed
The process when using Q_ESC_CAL=1 is
remove your propellers for safety
power up just the flight board and not your motors. If you donât have
the ability to isolate power to the ESCs when on battery power then
power up your flight board on USB power
set the Q_ESC_CAL parameter to 1
change to QSTABILIZE mode
set the safety switch off to activate the outputs
arm your aircraft. The PWM output on all quad motors will now be
controlled by your throttle stick
move the throttle stick to maximum
add power to your ESCs by connecting the battery
wait for the ESCs to beep to indicate they have registered the
maximum PWM
lower the throttle stick to zero and disarm your aircraft
you should hear a beep from your ESCs to indicate they have
registered the throttle range
The process when using Q_ESC_CAL=2 is
remove your propellers for safety
power up just the flight board and not your motors. If you donât have
the ability to isolate power to the ESCs when on battery power then
power up your flight board on USB power
set the Q_ESC_CAL parameter to 2
change to QSTABILIZE mode
set the safety switch off to activate the outputs
arm your aircraft. The PWM output on all quad motors will now be at maximum
add power to your ESCs by connecting the battery
wait for the ESCs to beep to indicate they have registered the
maximum PWM
disarm your aircraft
you should hear a beep from your ESCs to indicate they have
registered the throttle range
Note that using Q_ESC_CAL=1 can be useful for testing your motors
response. This is the only mode when you are able to directly control
the throttle level on all your motors at once. While in this mode you
can use a laser tachometer to test your motor speeds at different
throttle levels if you have one.
Warning
Be sure to set Q_ESC_CAL back to zero after calibrating for normal operation
Old ESC Calibration Procedure (3.5.3 and earlier)Â¶
remove your propellers for safety
power up just the flight board and not your motors. If you donât have
the ability to isolate power to the ESCs when on battery power then
power up your flight board on USB power
set both the parameters Q_M_SPIN_ARM and Q_THR_MID to 1000.
This sets the PWM output when armed at zero throttle to full power
set the safety switch off to activate the outputs
arm your aircraft. The PWM output on all quad motors will now climb
to maximum.
add power to your ESCs by connecting the battery
wait for the ESCs to beep to indicate they have registered the
maximum PWM
disarm your aircraft. The ESCs should beep again indicating they have
registered minimum PWM
Now set the Q_M_SPIN_ARM and Q_THR_MID parameters back to the
correct values. A value of 50 for Q_M_SPIN_ARM is a reasonable
starting point. For Q_THR_MID a value of between 500 and 600 is good
depending on the power of your motors
