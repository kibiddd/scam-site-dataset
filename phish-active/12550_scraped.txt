Welcome to the Joseph M. Pizzurro Memorial Foundation
Joseph M. Pizzurro was a talented artist and musician who graduated from North Babylon High School in 2002. Joe went on to become a successful Graphic Designer as well as an amazing husband and father. Sadly, Joe passed away suddenly in 2012. The Joe Pizzurro Memorial Scholarship was created in 2013.  The Joseph M. Pizzurro Memorial Foundation, Inc. was established in 2014 by Joe’s wife Kelly, his sister Pietrina, sister-in-law Colleen and close friend Jacqui.  The Joseph M. Pizzurro Memorial Foundation, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization.
The mission of the Joseph M. Pizzurro Memorial Foundation is to provide a scholarship to deserving students pursuing a College education in a creative field. We would also like to give back to the community to honor Joe’s good nature and kindness.
