How can I be involved?
We are always looking for volunteers, young and old, who care for their community and can join a local patrol. If you have spare time on a regular basis whether it be weekly, fortnightly or less then please contact your local patrol.  You can make a difference in your community by getting involved. The more volunteers we have in each patrol the more patrols they can roster in your community.

Keeping your community safe
The role of a patroller will vary slightly depending on the needs of each community. All of the patrol groups cover their local residential streets. In addition some of the patrol groups patrol town centres, beaches, boat ramps, shopping malls, car parks, schools and parks. We also take part in local community events. You can assist your community by joining your local patrol.
