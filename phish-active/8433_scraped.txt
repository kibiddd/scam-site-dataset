Updated Privacy Policy
Factotum have always taken data protection very seriously. You can trust us to respect your privacy and keep your personal information safe. Legislation aimed at giving you more control over this is called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The Data Protection Regulation allows you to have more control over what happens to your information. For instance, if you don’t want our newsletters anymore, we’ll stop sending them to you. Of course, if you are a current landlord, tenant, supplier or factoring customer we’ll still keep you informed of any relevant information.
Our new Privacy Policy takes effect from 25 May 2018. It will tell you exactly what information we can collect, what we can use it for, who we can share it with – and how we will keep it safe.
Read our privacy policy.
