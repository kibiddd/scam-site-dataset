Many have said, even though they have had their bee problems treated by otherCorona de Tucson pest control or Corona de Tucson bee removal or Corona de Tucson bee control service companies, they still continue to get bee hives back; sometimes more than once a year at the same place or in close proximity. There is good reason for this; the bee removal and/or honeycomb removal were not done properly and there was little or no attempt to address the additional bee pheromone problem or wasp pheromone problem or hornet pheromone problem at the site.Generally, the callers always describe the work that was done by the other companies as follows: "A service technician showed up, sometimes not even wearing a bee suit or having a ladder, spent 10 to 20 minutes, and sprayed the opening the bees were flying in and out of. Essentially, I paid for someone to spray a can of insecticide, don't know what, at the opening and leave a couple of pest strips or sticky boards at the entrance to the sites. I spent a good amount of money with them and the bees never went away or they came back within a short period of time. I called the company I used back, and they told me I had a new problem and they wanted to charge me again for a new service." In many cases, the company either denied service or returned three or four times without success and then they refused to do anymore." Eventually, because of this, we'll get called or the pest control company refers the property owner to us.

Unlike pest control companies this work is not a sideline for us, it is all we do. We specialize in bee removal, bee control, wasp control, hornet control and honeycomb removal and are the best in the business.African honeybee colonies are always dangerous to handle, sometimes lethal, and can cause tremendous damage to Corona de Tucson homes and commercial building structures if not treated properly. Improper methods worsen the damage and lead to future bee problems. Bee pheromone, a marker scent the bee colony deposits at the site, does not go away on its own and cannot simply be scrubbed away with soap and water. A passing swarm can pick up the marker from a considerable distance away and will try to re-occupy a former bee site before it will go anywhere else. After a bee colony extermination, honeycomb, if not removed properly, will immediately start attracting robbing bees from other local colonies and begin liquefying and melting down. Honeycomb meltdown can saturate building materials like drywall and insulation, cause wet rot to framing structures, cause mold and attract other unwanted pests and spread pheromone scent throughout your walls making the problem much larger and considerably worsen the damage to your Corona de Tucson home or property rated lightly by companies professing to provide bee eradication, bee extermination, bee removal or honeycomb removal services.
