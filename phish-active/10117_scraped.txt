Unfortunately, it’s not yet available for iOS, but we’re working on it, and it will soon be accessible for iPhones as well.

What are the advantages of using GB WhatsApp?
As i told you above GB WhatsApp has many features that offcial WhatsApp doesn’t provide you. Let me tell you why people prefer using GB WhatsApp over the Official WhatsApp.
Enhanced Privacy Features: GB WhatsApp Pro provides several enhanced privacy features that are not available in the official WhatsApp app. For example, you can hide double ticks, forward tags, and even prevent messages from being deleted.
Security Features: GB WhatsApp prioritizes your security. It offers built-in features like app locking and individual chat locking or hiding, so you don’t need to install any third party application to lock your WhatsApp.
Customization: GBWhatsApp is renowned worldwide for its customization options. You can easily personalize your home screen, chat screen, and even change the app icon. If you enjoy customizing your apps, give GB WhatsApp a try!
This is just a sneak peak of GB WhatsApp Pro. Now let’s see all the features in detail that make it a popular choice over the original WhatsApp app.
Top GB WhatsApp Features
App and Chat LockGB WhatsApp prioritizes your security. It includes a feature that allows you to lock the entire app and even individual chats. This eliminates the need for third-party locking applications that were previously necessary.
Auto ReplyOne of GB WhatsApp’s standout features is its auto-reply functionality. This allows you to save frequently used responses. When you’re busy, GB WhatsApp can automatically send a saved reply to incoming messages.
DND ModeIf you’re busy and don’t want to respond to WhatsApp messages, simply activate DND (Do Not Disturb) mode in GB WhatsApp Pro. This will disable data only for WhatsApp, preventing you from receiving any messages.
Freeze Last SeenYou can freeze your last seen status in GB WhatsApp. This allows you to control who can see when you were last online. By freezing your last seen, you can appear offline to others while still viewing their activity.
Hide Double TickWhen someone sends you a message, they’ll see a single tick indicating it was sent. The second tick appears when the message is delivered to you. With this feature, you can hide the second tick, making it appear as though the message hasn’t been delivered until you reply.
Hide Typing/Recording IndicatorThis feature allows you to hide your typing or recording indicator from the recipient’s chat screen. Simply enable the feature, and GB WhatsApp will prevent others from seeing that you’re typing or recording.
Anti-Delete MessagesGBWhatsApp offers an anti-revoke feature. This prevents others from deleting messages after they’ve been sent, allowing you to read them even if the sender tries to delete them.
Hide Online StatusWhile GBWhatsApp’s hide online status feature is similar to the official WhatsApp’s, it offers a slight improvement. In official WhatsApp, when you hide your online status, you also lose the ability to see others’ online status. However, with GBWhatsApp, you can still view others’ last seen and online status while keeping your own hidden.
Increased Media SharingGBWhatsApp offers a significant advantage over official WhatsApp when it comes to media sharing. While official WhatsApp has limitations on file size, GBWhatsApp allows you to send files up to 2 GB. Additionally, GBWhatsApp preserves the highest quality for photos and videos, unlike official WhatsApp, which often reduces image and video quality.
Who can Call You?GB WhatsApp gives you control over who can call you. This allows you to avoid unwanted calls by selecting only the contacts you want to receive calls from. Others won’t be able to call you on WhatsApp.
Stunning ThemesGB WhatsApp offers a vast library of over 1000 themes that you can download from its theme store. Tired of the default WhatsApp theme? Install GBWhatsApp and enjoy a fresh, customizable look for your messaging app.
In App TranslationOne of the most notable features of GB WhatsApp Pro is its in-app translation functionality. This allows you to seamlessly translate messages into different languages while chatting with others. For example, if you’re communicating with a friend from another country and neither of you speaks the other’s language, this feature can facilitate effortless conversation.
Change Font StyleIn addition to themes, GB WhatsApp also allows you to customize the font style. The app offers over 100 different fonts that you can download and use.
Multiple Account SupportUnlike official WhatsApp, which limits you to one account at a time, GB WhatsApp Pro allows you to use multiple accounts simultaneously. This is ideal for people who need to manage multiple WhatsApp accounts for personal or professional purposes.
GB WhatsApp Pro Update
Don’t worry about GB WhatsApp Pro updates! The developers constantly work on the app, and updates are pushed regularly. Since the app isn’t available on the Play Store, you’ll need to visit the website gbapp.download. There, you can find the latest version of GB WhatsApp. Simply download the latest version and install it over your existing app. That’s all! This process will update your GB WhatsApp.
