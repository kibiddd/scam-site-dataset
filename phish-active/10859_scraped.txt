Client Types Advanced offers the full set of Web collaboration features. This Web Client works best with newer browsers and faster Internet connections. Standard is recommended when Internet connections are slow, when using older browsers, or for easier accessibility. Mobile is recommended for mobile devices. To set Default to be your preferred client type, change the sign in options in your Preferences, General tab after you sign in.
Note that your web browser or display does not fully support the Advanced version.  We strongly recommend that you use the Standard client.
