Welcome to AAUE
American Association for Upper Egypt (AAUE) was founded in 1996 by United States citizens of Egyptian origins to answer the call of the AUEED (Association of Upper Egypt for Education and Development) which for over 75 years, has been devoted to empowering under priviledged communities in Upper Egypt, through education and social development programs.
AAUE is a registered not for profit charity, non-partisan and secular organization. It is organized under the Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation for charitable purposes within the meaning of section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
The principal public and charitable purpose of the corporation is to support AUEED's projects and activities in the areas of education at the primary and preparatory level, health and nutrition and social development for children, women and youth living in the rural communities of Upper Egypt .
AAUE is comparable to "Les Partenaires de l'Association de la Haute Egypte" (PACHE), a Canadian based charitable organization. AAUE was reorganized in 2009 and a new Board of directors was appointed thanks to the initiative and leadership of PACHE.
