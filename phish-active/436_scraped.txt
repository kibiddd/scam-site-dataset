Testimonials
Jonathan Wells - Project Manager
Amey
âPACE were subcontracted to deliver the civils element of the Western Route Safer Faster Isolation project between Paddington and Acton. They have planned and proactively delivered a quality product for the project, raising many TQâs to clarify the scope and becoming an integral part of the team. PACE have reacted well to change of scope and looked to value engineer the works so that the Client has a quality product with savings in budget. There have been no accidents or incidents and PACE staff have been proactive in supporting the safety culture on site.â
Simon Robinson - Head of Civils Engineering
Linbrooke
âI've been on the phone this morning with one of my senior supervisors to discuss the works carried out at Frome and Hungerford and he had nothing but praise and admiration for the team you supplied this week. So can you say thankyou and well done for a job completed to a high standard to your team.â
Daniel Clouth - Project Manager - Infrastructure
COLAS Rail
âPACE Infrastructure Solutions have been supporting Colas Rail on the Paddington to Reading Train Detection Enhancement Scheme, a signalling upgrade project with substantial supporting works including Telecoms, Electrification and Civils, since June 2020. From a civils perspective, they supplied Colas Rail with skilled groundworkers, gangers and supervisors who delivered the civils works to a high standard, working safely and efficiently. With many challenges along the way, such as, installing 5km of troughing on a busy and congested part of the network or installing over 600m of retention system on the side of a steep embankment, PACE stepped up to each challenge with their engaging site/management staff, punctual working culture and thorough training to cover all requirements on site. We look forward to working with Pace Infrastructure Solutions on future projects.â
Lee Payne - Project Manager
S&T COVER
âS&T Cover Ltd utilized the services of PACE throughout the delivery of the FDM Cabling Project which required some 162,000 metersof 5 pair cable to be purchased, run, put to bed and tested on the Brighton Main Line and Branch Lines all within seven months. This involved the use of Road Rail machines as well as hand pulling exercises to be carried out in very short possessions and Line Block timescales to ensure the delivery and handover on time so as not to delay the next stage of the Project. The success in delivering this project on time was made a lot easier due to the support received by PACE and I would recommend using them to other colleagues as I have continued to use them on other Projects.â
