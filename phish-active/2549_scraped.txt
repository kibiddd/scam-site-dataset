Configuring a Telemetry Radio using Mission PlannerÂ¶
This article explains how to configure Telemetry Radios using Mission
Planner.
Tip
Many users will not need to configure their radios! One case where
you might do so is when you use your vehicle with others â in which case
you will need to specify different radio channels (Net ID).
OverviewÂ¶
Mission Planner supports configuring your radios using a simple GUI
interface.
To make changes:
Connect one of the radios to your computer using the micro USB cable.
Power the radio attached to the vehicle by plugging in the vehicleâs
battery.
Open the Mission Planner and go to the Initial Setup | Optional
Hardware | SiK Radio page.
Select the correct COM port and set the baud rate to 57600. Ensure
the âConnectâ button is in a disconnected state as shown in the image
below..
Press the Load Settings button and both the Local and Remote
areas should fill in with values including the firmware Version
The most common entry to change is the Net ID. The default is 25
for most radios but if you plan to fly in an area with other pilots
who may be using the same radio it is best to change this to another
number.
After making changes, click the Copy Required Items to Remote and
press Save Settings
Other parameters you may choose to update:
Baud (default 57) : the rate at which the mission planner or
vehicle communicates with the local radio. â57â = 57600 bits per
second.
Air Speed (default 64) : the rate at which the two radios will
communicate with each other. â64â = 64kbps (kilobits per second).
Setting a lower rate will increase the range of the radio but reduce
the rate of data (i.e. the amount of data that can be sent in a given
time) across the link.
ECC (default is âonâ): controls whether error correction is on or
off. When on â12/24 Golay error correcting codeâ is used which
involves sending a 16 bit CRC byte along with the data to ensure that
bad data is thrown away. Unfortunately this also halves the data rate
across the link but it is recommended to leave ECC on especially when
when the vehicle is far from home base because transmission errors
increase greatly with distance.
MAVlink (default is âMAVLinkâ) : this controls whether the
transmission is optimised for MAVLink packets or not. Set to âLow
Latencyâ if using a joystick or an android tabletâs virtual joystick
to manually fly the vehicle. Note that information on the radio
signal strength (rssi) and error rate is only sent if this parameter
is set to its default, âMAVLinkâ.
Tx Power (default 20) : the transmission power where
1=1.3milliWats, 2=1.5mW, 5=3.2mW, 8=6.3mW,11=12.5mW, 14=25mW,
17=50mW, 20=100mW. This should be set to conform with your local
regulations.
Some per-country information
is linked here.
Duty Cycle (default 100) : the maximum percentage of time that
the radio will transmit packets. Some regions of the world allow for
higher transmit power or more frequencies if you have a duty cycle
below a given threshold. So for example in Europe you can transmit on
a wider range of frequencies in the 433 band if your duty cycle is
below 10%. Telemetry traffic is quite âburstyâ, so the average
transmit time is not generally high. When you set a duty cycle below
100% then your available bandwidth will be reduced, so you will find
it will only work well for telemetry at higher air speeds. A radio
can be set to receive only by setting its Duty Cycle to zero.
Max Window (default 33) : ensure the GCS can send a packet to the
vehicle ever 33msec. This should be kept as a low number (like 33)
when the âMAVLinkâ setting is âLow Latencyâ
LBT Rssi (default 0) : holds the threshold used for âlisten
before talkâ which allows it to comply with some countryâs regulatory
requirements. When non-zero the radio listens for quiet period of
time where no signals from other radios are received before
transmitting. This parameter holds the receiver signal strength below
which the airwaves are considered âquietâ. If this param is set to
zero then LBT is disabled. Setting this to 25 (the min) is -121 dBm.
Each increment above 25 raises the threshold by about 0.5dB so for
example 40 equals a signal strength of 7.5dB. The full formula is:
signal_dBm = (RSSI / 1.9) - 127
The LBT implementation in the radio uses a minimum listen time of
5ms, plus randomised listen time as per the European 9.2.2.2 rules.
Note that in many regions you need to implement LBT in conjunction
with AFA (Adaptive Frequency Agility). The radio implements AFA as
long as you have NUM_CHANNELS set to more than 1.
RTS CTS hardware flow control. If you are using a ArduPilot
firmware version released after mid 2016 and you have connected your
radio to Pixhawk Telem1 Telem2 or other RTS/CTS supporting telemetry
port then you can activate this, or set it to auto to improve
performance.
