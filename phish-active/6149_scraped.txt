PhoneGap's new Device Wall
February 23, 2015

It creates a dynamic testing site within the office space where, through its back-end infrastructure, up to 100 devices are simultaneously synced, charged, and tested directly on the wall.

PhoneGap Explained Visually
February 23, 2015
I’ve been “out and about” lately, attending tech conferences, meetup groups, and meeting with developers in their offices, and I am getting great feedback on mobile development and PhoneGap. There are some common questions that I am often asked, and I hope this post helps everyone understand PhoneGap better.     PhoneGap     Before I go too far, let me attempt to clearly state what PhoneGap  is… PhoneGap  is an application container technology that allows you to create natively-installed applications for mobile devices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   The core engine for PhoneGap is also 100% open source, under the Apache Cordova project.  You can read more about PhoneGap under my “ What is PhoneGap? ” & Other Common Questions post.
