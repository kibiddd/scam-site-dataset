Accessibility
Please follow accessibility criteria for development.
Switches support content labeling for accessibility and are readable by most
screen readers, such as TalkBack. Text rendered in switches is automatically
provided to accessibility services. Additional content labels are usually
unnecessary.
Implementation
Jetpack Compose
In your composable screen you can use:
OdsSwitch(
checked = true,
onCheckedChange = { doSomething() },
enabled = true
)
