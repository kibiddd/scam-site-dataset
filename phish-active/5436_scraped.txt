Welcome to Gmail
A Google approach to email.
Gmail is a new kind of webmail, built on the idea that email can be more intuitive, efficient, and useful. And maybe even fun. After all, Gmail has:
Fast search
Use Google search to find the exact message you want, no matter when it was sent or received.
Lots of space
Over 2757.272164 megabytes (and counting) of free storage so you'll never need to delete another message.
Chat right inside Gmail
It's just one click to chat with the people you already email. You can even save your chats in your Gmail account. Learn more
Mobile access
Read Gmail on your mobile phone by pointing your phone's web browser to http://gmail.com/app. Learn more
Get Gmail for your business, school, or organization with Google Apps.
